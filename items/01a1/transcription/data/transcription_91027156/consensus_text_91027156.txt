It has been supposed by many
Naturalists "|&: the Authority of
Buffon has been attached to
the position "that the seat of
Volcanic fires is superficial,
& that the phaenomena result
from materials accumulated in
the interior of the mountain which
supplies the aperture for the
eruption. - |_ [underline]But this[/underline] opinion
is certainly founded upon partial
& [underline]insufficient[/underline] observation. -
- |_ The great Earthquakes which
precede & accompany the event;
the extent of the convulsion &
above all the nature of the unaltered
materials thrown out "demonstrate
that the Agents essential [insertion]to[/insertion] the operation
are hidden deep in the bosom of
the Earth & that they are beneath
or immediately in contact with "parts
of the primary Rocks
