This smoke appeared to me
extraneous to the lava; at least the
fragments of the later [underline]neither[/underline] smoke,

In consequence of the alternate rising
and sinking of the lava, according as it
is inflated, or makes its [underline]discharge[/underline], the
depth of the crater cannot be considered
as constant. - When the lava is at
its height, it may be about five and
twenty or thirty feet deep, and when
it has subsided about forty or fifty;
|_ the greatest rising of the lava may,
therefore be [underline]estimated[/underline] at about
twenty feet. -
