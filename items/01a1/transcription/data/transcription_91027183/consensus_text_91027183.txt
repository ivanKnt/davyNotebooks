East in the middle of the Ocean
a violent eruption of fire & smoke
took place - the water was raised
to a great height & the wave
spreading itself in all directions
overturned [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]every thing[/insertion] that it met with,
& destroyed ships in [insertion]the ports of[/insertion] the Island
of Candia which is nearly
eighty miles distant - the sea
was before in that [insertion]place[/insertion] fathomless
but [underline]Land[/underline] was raised by
this tremendous operation to
within eight feet of the
surface.
- In 1707 not far from the
same place, a considerable Island
of six miles in circumference &
of [deletion]considerable[/deletion] [insertion]great[/insertion] height was actually
elevated -
- This event [deletion]occu[/deletion] took up nearly
15 months for its completion
And [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]a full & apparently[/insertion] accurate account of it, is
to be found in the letters edifiantes
& curieuses
