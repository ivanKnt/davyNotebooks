others continued with unabated violence
[underline]fifteen or eighteen[/underline] minutes, |_ between the

several times into the air to a
considerable height. - These partial
jets however, seldom exceeded, a [underline]minute[/underline]
and sometimes [insertion]not only[/insertion] [deletion]not[/deletion] a few [underline]seconds[/underline] in
duration
After the eruption of it had been
violent, the water sank into subterranean
caverns, and left the pipe quite empty.
If the eruption had been moderate, the
[deletion]subsidence[/deletion] [insertion]falling[/insertion] of the water was proportionally
less - |_ The first time the pipe was
perfectly emptied, we sounded its depth
and found the bottom very rough
and irregular. The pipe remains but
a very short time empty. After a
few seconds the water [underline]rushes into it[/underline]
