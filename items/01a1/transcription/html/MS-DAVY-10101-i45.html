            Much of the water began to descend<br xml:id="">
            again at different heights, and was again<br xml:id="">
            projected by other columns, which meet<br xml:id="">
            it, as they arose. At last having filled<br xml:id="">
            the bason it rolled in great waves over<br xml:id="">
            its edge, and forming numberless rills,<br xml:id="">
            made its way down the side of the mound<br xml:id="">

            more fell to the ground, in heavy<br xml:id="">

            In certain shades, the colour was green<br xml:id="">
            like that of the sea; but in their<br xml:id="">
            further ascent all distinction of colour<br xml:id="">
