sometimes with more and sometimes with

reached the distance of twentyfive or thirty feet,
from the upper edge, a sound is heard not unlike
a very short clap of thunder; while at the same,
moment, a portion of the lava, seperated into a
thousand pieces, is thrown up, with indescribable
swiftness, accompanied with a copious eruption
of smoke, ashes and sand. - A few moments
before the report, the superficies of the lava
is inflated, and covered with large bubles;

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00020|dnp01a120pp|91027175[/page]

[deletion]bubbles[/deletion] presently burst, and at the same [deletion]time[/deletion]

place. - [deletion]After the explosion, the lava[/deletion]
[deletion]the crater sinks, but soon again rises as[/deletion]
[deletion]before and new tumours appear: which again[/deletion]
[deletion]burst, and produce new explosions. - When[/deletion]
[deletion]the lava sinks it produces little or no sound;[/deletion]
[deletion]but when it rises and especially when it[/deletion]
 [deletion]begins to be inflated with bubbles, it is[/deletion]
[deletion]accompanied with a sound, similar; in[/deletion]
[deletion]proportion to the difference of magnitude [insertion]intensity[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]to that of a liquor, boiling vehemently[/deletion]
[deletion]in a caldron.[/deletion]
Every [deletion]ejection[/deletion] [insertion]eruption[/insertion], however small, was
not only [deletion]accompanied[/deletion] [insertion]preceded[/insertion] by an explosion,
but was proportionate to it in its intensity.
- Hence, as the stones which are [deletion]only[/deletion]
thrown [insertion]only[/insertion] to the height of ten or twenty
yards above the Crater, are not visible to
the eye at a distance, so neither is the

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00022|dnp01a122pp|91027177[/page]
detonation by which such ejections are
accompanied, sensible to the ear.
|_ The redness of the larger ignited,
stones which were only pieces of scoriaceous
lava was visible in the [underline]air[/underline] notwithstanding
the light of the sun. - Many of them
clashed against each other and were
broken, which happened only when they
were at a certain height; for when they
were nearer to the Volcano, they frequently
[underline]adhered,[/underline] [underline]on touching each other,[/underline] in consequence
of [underline]the fluidity[/underline] they retained. - The
lava of the Crater, when it rose or fell,
emitted [deletion]smoak[/deletion] but little [deletion]smoak[/deletion] smoke;
but a great quantity when it exploded.
- The smoke issued from its fissures,
but almost immediately [deletion]disa[/deletion] disappeared
after the explosion. - |_ It might be
compared [insertion]to[/insertion] the smoke produced by the
firing of gunpowder; and which

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00023|dnp01a123pp|91027178[/page]

appears, and disappears, with the flash.
This smoke appeared to me
extraneous to the lava; at least the
fragments of the later [underline]neither[/underline] smoke,
as [underline]they fly[/underline] in the air, nor after
they have reached the ground.
In consequence of the alternate rising
and sinking of the lava, according as it
is inflated, or makes its [underline]discharge[/underline], the
depth of the crater cannot be considered
as constant. - When the lava is at
its height, it may be about five and
twenty or thirty feet deep, and when
it has subsided about forty or fifty;
|_ the greatest rising of the lava may,
therefore be [underline]estimated[/underline] at about
twenty feet. -

Though the ejections of the larger and
heavier stones have short intermissions,
those of the lesser and lighter have
scarcely any. - |_ Did not the

On the 20 of november 1720, a
subterraneous fire burst out of the sea
near Tercera, which threw up such a
vast quantity of stones, as in the space
of thirty days, formed an Island
about two leagues diameter, and [underline]nearly[/underline]
[underline]round[/underline]. - Prodigious quantities of

East in the middle of the Ocean
a violent eruption of fire & smoke
took place - the water was raised
to a great height & the wave
spreading itself in all directions
overturned [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]every thing[/insertion] that it met with,
& destroyed ships in [insertion]the ports of[/insertion] the Island
of Candia which is nearly
eighty miles distant - the sea
was before in that [insertion]place[/insertion] fathomless
but [underline]Land[/underline] was raised by
this tremendous operation to

- In 1707 not far from the

elevated -

"It was on the 23 of May 1707, at day break,
that the first appearances of the new Island were
perceived, slight shocks of an earthquake were
felt and a few rocks slowly and quietly rose
from the surface of the water. - |_ These rocks
for three or four days presented the same
aspect and some of the boldest inhabitants
of Santerin, in whom the first impression
of alarm had passed away; ventured upon
them. - And found them of a soft
white stone easily cut with a knife and
covered with sea weed and [underline]living[/underline] [underline]oisters[/underline]

were suddenly awakened to a sense of
danger by a motion of the rocks
so voilent, as to throw some of them
off their legs" and the little Island
suddenly began [underline]to rise[/underline] and to elevate
it self beneath them. - And they
had some difficulty in making their
escape.
For two months [deletion]the Island[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] continued to
increase [insertion]and[/insertion] in the middle of july, smoke

sea was in constant ebulition and
seven distinct groups of Rocks were

united themselves, and became one

it is [deletion]not im[/deletion] [insertion]very[/insertion] probable "that

By a gradual deposition [insertion]He says[/insertion] of the substances
dissolved in its water for a long succession
of [underline]years, perhaps for ages[/underline], a [deletion]mound[/deletion] [insertion]hill[/insertion] of
considerable height has been formed, from
the centre of which the Geyzer issues.
- |_ It rises through a perpendicular and
cylindrical pipe, or [underline]shaft, seventy[/underline] feet in
depth, and eight feet and a half in diameter
which opens into a bason or [deletion]funel[/deletion] funnel,
measuring fifty-nine feet from one edge [insertion]of it[/insertion] to
the other. - The bason is circular, &
the sides of it, as well [deletion]of[/deletion] those of the
pipe, are polished quite smooth by the
continual friction of the water. & They
are both formed with such [underline]mathematical[/underline]
[underline]truth[/underline], as to appear constructed by art.
- The declivity of the [deletion]mound[/deletion] [insertion]Hill[/insertion] begins
immediately from the borders of the bason.
- The incrustations are in some places
worn smooth, by the overflowing of the
water; in most however the[insertion]y[/insertion] rise in
numberless little tufts, which bear a

particles of spray, with a chrystaline
[underline]effloresence[/underline] so delicate as scarcely to bear
the slightest [deletion]touch[/deletion]. touch. - [underline]Unmolested[/underline].
the effloresence gradually hardens, and
although it looses its first delicacy, it
still [underline]remains exceedingly[/underline] beautiful.
These incrustations are of a light brown
colour, and extended a [underline]great way[/underline], in various
[underline]directions[/underline], [underline]from the borders of[/underline] the bason.
To the northward, they reach to a distance of
82 feet; to the East of 86 to the south of 118;
and of 124 to the west. - They are very hard
and do not appear in any part decaying,
or [underline]mouldering[/underline] into soil.
When our guides first led us [insertion]to[/insertion] the
geyzer, the bason was filled to within a
few feet of its edge. "the water [deletion]a[/deletion] was
transparent as chrystal, a slight steam
only arose from it, and the surface was

[page]43|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00043|dnp01a143pp|91027198[/page]
41
[insertion]ruffled[/insertion] but by a few bubbles, which now and then
came from the bottom of the pipe. - We
waited with anxiety for several minutes
expecting [deletion]for several minutes[/deletion] at every
instant some interruption to this tranquility
- |_ on a sudden, another spring immediately
in front of the place, on which we were
standing, darted its water above an hundred
feet into the air with the velocity of
an arrow, and the jets succeeding this
first eruption were still higher. This
[deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] the spring [deletion]already mentioned under[/deletion]
[deletion]the name of[/deletion] [insertion]called[/insertion] the new Geyzer.
|_ While gazing in silence and wonder
at this unexpected and beautiful display,
we were alarmed by a sudden shock of the
ground under our feet, accompanied with
a hollow noise not unlike the distant [underline]firing[/underline]
of Cannon. - Another shock soon followed
and we observed the water in the
bason much agitated. - |_ The Icelanders
hastily laid hold of us, and forced us to

[page]44|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00044|dnp01a144pp|91027199[/page]
retreat some yards. - The water in the
mean time boiled violently, and heaved as
 if some expansive [insertion]power[/insertion] were labouring beneath
its weight, and some of it was thrown
up a few feet above the bason. -
again there were two or three shocks
of the ground and a repetition of the
same noise. - In an instant the
surrounding Atmosphere was filled with
volumes of steam rolling [underline]over[/underline] each
[underline]other[/underline] as they ascended, in a manner
inexpressively beautiful, and through
which, columns of water, shivering into
foam, darted in rapid [underline]succession[/underline] to
[underline]heights,[/underline] which (at the time,) we were
little qualified to estimate. - |_ Indeed
the novelty and splendour of such a
[deletion]scene[/deletion] scene had affected our imaginations
so forcibly, that we believed the extreme
height of the jet to be much greater
than it was afterwards determined to
be, |_ in a subsequent eruption M[superscript]r[/superscript] Baine
ascertained by means of a Quadrant the
greatest elevation to which the jets of water were
thrown to be 96 feet

[page]45|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00045|dnp01a145pp|91027200[/page]
43
Much of the water began to descend
again at different heights, and was again
projected by other columns, which meet
it, as they arose. At last having filled
the bason it rolled in great waves over
its edge, and forming numberless rills,
made its way down the side of the mound
|_ Much was lost in vapour also, and still
more fell to the ground, in heavy
showers of spray. - |_ The intervals
at which the several jets succeeded
each other were too short for the eye
to distinguish them. - As they rose
out of the bason, the[insertion]y[/insertion] reflected by their
density the purest and most brilliant blue.
In certain shades, the colour was green
like that of the sea; but in their
further ascent all distinction of colour
was lost and the jets broken into a
thousand parts, appeared white as snow
|_ Several of them were forced upwards

[page]46|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00046|dnp01a146pp|91027201[/page]
perpendicularly; |_ but many, receiving a slight
inclination, as they burst from the bason
were projected in beautiful curves, and
the spray which fell from them, caught
by a succeeding jet was hurried away
still higher than it had been [deletion]perhaps[/deletion]
before. *
The jets were made with
inconceivable velocity and those which
escaped uninterupted, terminated in [deletion]shape[/deletion]
sharp points and lost themselves in
the air - |_ The eruption changing its
form at every instant and blending
variously with the clouds of steam that
surrounded [deletion]it[/deletion] it, continued for ten or twelve
minutes; the [underline]water[/underline] then subsided through
the pipe and disappeared
|_ The eruptions of the geyzer
succeeded each other with some degree
of regularity, but they are not equally
violent, or of equal duration. - [deletion]Some[/deletion]
[deletion]lasted scarcely[/deletion]

[page]47|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00047|dnp01a147pp|91027202[/page]
45
Some lasted scarcely eight or ten, while
others continued with unabated violence
[underline]fifteen or eighteen[/underline] minutes, |_ between the
great eruptions while the pipe and
bason were filling, the water burst
several times into the air to a
considerable height. - These partial
jets however, seldom exceeded, a [underline]minute[/underline]
and sometimes [insertion]not only[/insertion] [deletion]not[/deletion] a few [underline]seconds[/underline] in
duration
After the eruption of it had been
violent, the water sank into subterranean
caverns, and left the pipe quite empty.
If the eruption had been moderate, the
[deletion]subsidence[/deletion] [insertion]falling[/insertion] of the water was proportionally
less - |_ The first time the pipe was
perfectly emptied, we sounded its depth
and found the bottom very rough
and irregular. The pipe remains but
a very short time empty. After a
few seconds the water [underline]rushes into it[/underline]

[page]48|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00048|dnp01a148pp|91027203[/page]
again with a bubbling noise, and during
the time that it is rising in the pipe,
it is frequently darted suddenly into the
air to different heights, sometimes two or
three [deletion]fathoms[/deletion] sometimes sixty [underline]feet[/underline] above
the sides of the bason. |_ by a suprise
of this kind, while we were engaged [insertion]in[/insertion]
measuring the diameter of the well,
we had nearly been scalded, and although
we were able to withdraw ourselves from
the great body of water as it descended
yet we remained exposed to the falling
spray, which fortunately was so much
cooled in the air as to do us no mischief
|_ Of these jets we counted twenty in
an hour and half, [underline]during which[/underline] the waters
had filled [underline]the pipe[/underline] and in part the
[underline]bason.[/underline] - It then seemed oftentimes agitated,
and boiled with great violence. The
jets were more beautiful, and continued
longer as the quantity of water in the
bason increased. - |_ The resistance being

[page]49|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00049|dnp01a149pp|91027204[/page]
47
being greater, their force was in some degree
broken and [underline]their form[/underline] more divided
produced a greater display of foam & vapour
|_ While the pipe was filling, we threw
into to it several stones of considerable
weight, which whenever the water burst
forth with any violence, were projected
much higher than itself. - These stones
in falling were met by other columns
of water, and amidst those they rose &
fell repeatedly. - They were easily
distinguished, in [underline]the white[/underline] foam
and contributed much to the novelty
and beauty of this extraordinary
phaenomenon. -
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Stanley adds in
concluding his account - "This
is the best description that I
have been able to give of these
celebrated fountains - but I
cannot flatter myself that it will

[page]50|MS-DAVY-10101-000-00050|dnp01a150pp|91027205[/page]

sources of compassion are wanting by which
the [underline]portraiture[/underline] of such extraordinary scenes
can be [underline]assisted[/underline]. |_ Nature, no where, offers
objects, bearing a resemblance to them;
and art even [insertion]in[/insertion] constructing the water works
of Versailles, has produced nothing that
can at all illustrate the magnificent
appearances of the Geyzer. - |_ All then
that I hope for is to have said so much
as may enable you to complete in
your [underline]imagination[/underline] the picture which
I have only sketched. - Imagination
alone can supply the [underline]noise[/underline] and [underline]motion[/underline]
which accompany such large bodies
of water bursting from their confinement
and must be left [underline]to[/underline] paint what I
have not been able to describe, the
brilliancy of colouring, the purity of
the spray the quick change of effect,
and the thousand varieties of form into
