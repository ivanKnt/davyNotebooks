between magnetic & electrical attraction (& supposed
by a singular felicity of induction & with a
kind of prophetic sagacity [underline]"That the motions[/underline]
of the heavenly bodies [underline]might depend[/underline] upon
[underline]a peculiar gravitative, or attractive power[/underline] [insertion]2[/insertion].) - 
- About 50 years after [person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] had
made known his researches the illustrious
Boyle commenced his career of experimental
investigation - Amidst the infinite variety
of objects, all of which came upon the
mind as so many newly produced wonders;
[underline]the electrical facts afforded but a subor =[/underline]
=dinate [underline]interest[/underline]; |_& Boyle added very
little to what his predecessor had effected.-
|_He seems to have been the first person,
however who observed the electrical light -
which appeared as he was rendering a gem
from Italy [underline]electrical by friction[/underline], - & he
referred the luminous appearance of diamonds
& of other stones after being rubbed to the
same cause . -
