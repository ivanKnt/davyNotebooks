extraordinary narrations of effects
produced by Electricity.- |_ For
two or three years the public
journals were filled with discussions
of miraculous Histories, which were
often advanced in one number
& exploded in the next, producing
a continual warfare between the
credulous & the reasonable - between
the ignorant & men of sense - between
quacks & philosophers.-
- Signior Pivati of Venice
published various accounts of
the medical effects of drugs
experienced by different persons
who were electrified by glass
