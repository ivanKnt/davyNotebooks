speech made upon the occasion
entered into some noble views in
which there are striking hints of later
discoveries - & after stating that
there may be still [deletion]discovered[/deletion] [insertion]found out[/insertion], new
& more powerful modes of exciting
electricity & of submitting bodies
to its operation - He concludes in
his usual animated manner;
"But whether this will be the indiviual
effect or not, philosophy by these curious
& successful researches has made a
valuable acquisition; since we may
be assured, that whatever tends to
disclose the [underline]causa rerum[/underline], the secret
laws of Nature, cannot ultimately
fail of subjecting her, more or less,
to the uses of life; & of manifesting,
more & more, the wisdom & power
of the Creator in all his works."
