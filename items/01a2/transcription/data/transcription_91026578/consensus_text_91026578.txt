deep & interesting truth
- The scientific glory of a
country may be considered
in some measure as an
indication of its innate
strength - The exaltation
of reason must necessarily
be connected with the
exaltation of the other
noble faculties of the mind,
& there is one spirit of
enterprize vigour & conquest
in Science, arts & Arms
- When in the spring we see
the Rose budding we may
be sure that the parent
tree has put forth its
leaves. - And where
experimental philosophy flourishes
