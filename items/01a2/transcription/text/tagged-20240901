[underline]History of Electricity[/underline]
In the three last lectures I endeavoured
to give a general view of the physical facts of
Electricity. -
Before the chemical relations of this
branch of knowledge & the new arrangements
in corpuscular Philosophy flowing from them
are discussed [insertion]which they will be immediately after Easter[/insertion] it will I conceive be proper
to take a general view of the progress of
discovery in [underline]pure Electrical Science[/underline]. -
- - This will offer a recapitulation of the
principal circumstances that have been stated
- . It will point out the authorities which have
been my guides in this: enquiry, & the
course of reading demanded for an accurate
acquaintance with the subject. -
- - By giving the details in an historical
order I shall endeavour to avoid that
wearisome effect which would result from

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00002|dnp01a202pp|91026512[/page]
a developement of mere abstracted principles;
but still I fear [deletion]this lecture[/deletion] [insertion]this History[/insertion] will [insertion]I fear[/insertion] in [insertion]the[/insertion]
[deletion]many parts[/deletion] be a severe trial of [deletion]yours[/deletion]
patience. [insertion]of a part of my audience[/insertion] There cannot be any novelty
of character in it; - It will be
presenting to you old acquaintance - &
some part not even in a [underline]new[/underline] dress -
|_ The exercise of the memory is however
sometimes an agreeable occupation; - .
There is often an interest taken in
examining views or looking over maps,
of countries in which we have travelled;
[deletion]& the roads by which new districts[/deletion]  [insertion]in this light I hope these[/insertion]
[deletion]are explored must generally be[/deletion] [insertion]details will be considered[/insertion]
[deletion]continuations of those by which[/deletion]
[deletion]known districts are accessible[/deletion]. -

History of all the [deletion]numerate[/deletion] [insertion]various[/insertion] insulated exp,,[superscript]ts[/superscript]
that have been made - My endeavour
will be rather to fix your attention upon
the leading & grand discoveries which
form the epochs of the Science. - The
brilliancy of Electrical phenomena & the
facility of producing them led an
immense number of enquirers into this
field of research; - Many have developed
new objects in it but a very few only
have ascertained principles. |_ & in
philosophical annals the fame of
subordinate improvers is necessarily
absorbed in that of the noble inventors,
as in military details, the worth of
the common soldier, & of the subaltern
is as it were swallowed up in the
glory of the Generals _| [deletion]in Che[/deletion]
- - There is a peculiar interest in the
History of Electricity [underline]that some of the most[/underline]

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00004|dnp01a204pp|91026514[/page]
[underline]important advances[/underline] made in it have
been [underline]in our own[/underline] times; & by our
own Countrymen - & in this point
of view it is connected with our
self-approving & national feelings. -
|_ The origin of the great discoveries
likewise is well ascertained - The
narratives are copious & abundant; -
The spirit of just selection alone is
required & it would be more easy
to complain that the materials are
too abundant than that they are
too scanty. -
- - Even the most zealous vindicators
of the honour of Antiquity, have
relinquished the field [underline]of Electrical[/underline]
discovery, to the modern [underline]philosophers[/underline] -
|_ no obscure hint in [person]person_878|Laertius[/person], [misc]misc_455|Timeus[/misc],

found capable of being so interpreted as to
prove that the Greeks & Romans were
acquainted with any of the grand facts
of artificial electricity. -
-- The most important connection of the
science with Ancient times is in its
name; which is derived from the Greek
word Electron signifying amber. This
substance is described by several early
Authors, as possessing an attraction for
light substances when heated or rubbed -
& the same property is attributed to a stone
which Theophrastus calls Lyncurium &
which by some modern critics has been
supposed to be the [chemical]chemical_324|Tourmaline[/chemical], but which
from the description of the Greek Mineralogist
I am rather inclined to believe was the
[chemical]chemical_427|Topaz[/chemical]. - The [chemical]chemical_324|Tourmaline[/chemical] is generally
dark; but this stone is stated to have had
the colour of fire & to have been of two

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00006|dnp01a206pp|91026516[/page]
kinds, the one deep the other pale -
which agrees with the distinction
between the oriental & the European
[chemical]chemical_427|topazes[/chemical]. -
- - The reasons given by the ancient
philosophers for these attractive powers
are almost all equally absurd, & all
unworthy of notice; I shall not enter
upon them: |_ It would be idle &
ridiculous to go into darkness, when
so much light is within our reach. -
- Till the 16th Century, no
philosophical discovery had been
made in Electricity & the first
scientific investigator on the subject
was our Countryman [person]person_383|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Gilbert[/person]
who may with propriety be called
the parent of this great branch of
Natural Knowledge. -
- - [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person] ascertained by

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00007|dnp01a207pp|91026517[/page]

enlightened exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. that the attractive
property which the ancients supposed
to exist in two Bodies only, of a peculiar
& mysterious nature, was capable of
being excited in an immense number
of [underline]different substances[/underline] by heat & friction
- in the gems, in glass, [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical], sealing -
- wax & various [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] & resinous bodies
- He discovered the influence of
moist air & of aqueous fluids in
destroying the effects; which he found
were not impaired by oily substances. -
- [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person] saw in these new phenomena
the germs of great improvements & their
application to the processes of Nature.
|_ [underline]Such a general[/underline] power he conceived could
not exist, without its uses |_ & his views
are no less worthy of attention for their
philosophical precision than from the
manner in which they are directed to new
objects of discovery -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00008|dnp01a208pp|91026518[/page]
- - Gilberts' electrical researches were
published in 1600 in his treatise on the
magnet - |_ After [person]person_324|Roger Bacon[/person], he
seems to have been the earliest experimental
philosopher - |_& it is a remarkable
circumstance in the History of Science,
|_ that thought he is mentioned by [underline]Lord[/underline]
[person]person_124|[underline]berulam[/underline][/person], it is in the spirit of
censure, & not of approbation, -
- |_"Men" says he in his book
[otherwork]otherwork_094|"De augmentis Scientiarum"[/otherwork] "are continually
carrying too far their own [deletion]private[/deletion] [insertion]favourite[/insertion]
Theories, & endeavouring to accomplish
[underline]everything[/underline] by their own peculiar
Arts - Thus [person]person_085|Plato[/person] has made all
his [underline]Philosophy,[/underline] Theology, [person]person_138|Aristotle[/person]
Logic, & [person]person_384|Proclus[/person] Mathematics -
following these Sciences as their first
born children & making them their
Heirs to the exclusion of all others -

|_ So the chemists explain all things by the
processes of the fire place & the furnace.
|_ & our [underline]Countryman [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person][/underline] has attempted
to raise a general system upon the magnet
endeavouring to build a ship out of materials,
not sufficient to make the rowing pins
of a boat" - In another place he
treats the important electrical facts
which [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person] had discovered [insertion]"[/insertion] as fables. -
The illustrious Critic of the Sciences
was occasionally [underline]misled[/underline] by his Zeal
for the destruction of [underline]prejudices[/underline] & of false
opinions; & by his contempt for the
absurdities of the ancient schools. -
Anxious to build up his own great edifice,
with his own materials & by his own
strength, He refused all assistance; &
the founder of a new & grand Philosophy
He scorned to blend either the facts or
opinions of others, with what he

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00010|dnp01a210pp|91026520[/page]
conceived to be peculiarly his own work. -
- Confident of greatness, & looking with
a steadfast eye towards the creations
of his own noble genius - He did not
fully see the merit of others - as in
the meridian light of our own sun
we cannot perceive the stars
[deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]which are[/insertion] nevertheless [deletion]exist & are[/deletion]
the Suns of other systems. -
- |_No one can exceed me in
admiration of this great Man &
it is with a feeling of humility
that I venture to say that his
reproach of [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person] is unjust. -
- [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person] undoubtedly considered the
Earth as [deletion]possessing[/deletion] [insertion]endowed with[/insertion] magnetic poles, |_ &
this is now acknowledged as a truth -
& He was far from possessing an unwar-
=rantable Spirit of generalisation - |_ He
perfectly & most accurately distinguished

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00011|dnp01a211pp|91026521[/page]
between magnetic & electrical attraction (& supposed
by a singular felicity of induction & with a
kind of prophetic sagacity [underline]"That the motions[/underline]
of the heavenly bodies [underline]might depend[/underline] upon
[underline]a peculiar gravitative, or attractive power[/underline] [insertion]2[/insertion].) - 
- About 50 years after [person]person_383|Gilbert[/person] had
made known his researches the illustrious
[person]person_103|Boyle[/person] commenced his career of experimental
investigation - Amidst the infinite variety
of objects, all of which came upon the
mind as so many newly produced wonders;
[underline]the electrical facts afforded but a subor =[/underline]
=dinate [underline]interest[/underline]; |_& [person]person_103|Boyle[/person] added very
little to what his predecessor had effected.-
|_He seems to have been the first person,
however who observed the electrical light -
which appeared as he was rendering a gem
from [place]place_097|Italy[/place] [underline]electrical by friction[/underline], - & he
referred the luminous appearance of diamonds
& of other stones after being rubbed to the
same cause . -

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00012|dnp01a212pp|91026522[/page]
- [person]person_103|Boyle[/person] in his notion of [underline]Electrical[/underline]
[underline]attraction[/underline] was misled by the mechanical
philosophy.- As many electrical bodies
were glutinous - he conceived that they
emitted glutinous effluvia - which laid hold
of small particles & in their return to the
excited substance carried them back - an idea
scarcely worthy so excellent a philosopher -
|_but [deletion]my[/deletion] [person]person_124|Lord Bacon[/person], had given the world
a dread of [underline]occult qualities[/underline] & it was
in that age fashionable to explain every
thing after mechanical principles. -
- - The labours of a Contemporary of
[person]person_103|Boyle[/person], [person]person_390|[underline]Otto de Guericke[/underline][/person] had a much
greather influence on the progress of
the Science. -  |_This distinguished
personage ranks amongst the most
[underline]illustrious of inventors[/underline] in the experimental
Arts & we owe to him two of the most
important instruments of investigation ever
presented to the [deletion]world[/deletion] [insertion]public[/insertion] - One by which

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00013|dnp01a213pp|91026523[/page]
the properties of the atmosphere have been
investigated & a new world opened to us
in pneumatic Science: - [misc]misc_220|the air pump[/misc]. -
the other which has given us the means
of [underline]examining Electricity,[/underline] in its different
modifications - the Electrical machine. -
-- The first instrument for performing
Electrical exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] by friction was (as may
be easily conceived) exceedingly [underline]rude[/underline] in
its construction - |_ A [misc]misc_173|Globe[/misc] of [chemical]chemical_037|[underline]Sulphur[/underline][/chemical]
[underline]in a proper frame made to whirl upon[/underline]
[underline]an axis: was the apparatus [/underline] employed
by the Saxon Philosopher. - - With this
he performed a great number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. |_&
observed the electrical light; the Sound;
& various sensible phenomena which had
not been before noticed. -
- The most glorious name in the
Scientific annals of our Country & of
civilised Europe, is about this period
likewise, associated with the progress of

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00014|dnp01a214pp|91026524[/page]
- Electricity, - | _Sir Isaac [person]person_036|Newton[/person] made
several exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the excitation of bodies
by friction; & ascertained that excited
glass attracted & repelled light substances
on that side, even which had not been
rubbed. -
- Other more important objects soo
however occupied his [underline]attention[/underline] & he
altogether relinquished the enquiry -
-[underline]This infant State of Electricity[/underline],
was not calculated to employ such
a [underline]genius[/underline] who though an accomplished
& refined experiment[deletion]alist[/deletion] [insertion]er[/insertion]; shone still
more as a penetrating & sagacious
thinker - |_ Gifted above all other
men with the power of just combination
born rather for the discovery of [deletion]principles[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]phaenomena[/deletion][/insertion]
[deletion]than of facts[/deletion] laws than for the
observation of phenomena; [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]not as[/insertion]

[deletion]- This idea of his Character is even[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]shewn[/deletion] [insertion]demonstrated[/insertion] in the hints that He[/deletion]
[deletion]has given concerning the cause[/deletion]
[deletion]of electrical action - for as I[/deletion]

- Mr [person]person_032|Hawksbee[/person] about the year 1709
brought forwards a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on different
modes of exciting Electricity - He substituted
for the [misc]misc_173|Globe[/misc] of [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] of [person]person_390|Otto de Guericke[/person]
globes & cylinders of Glass & found much
stronger electrical effects - he made many

exp[insertion]ts[/insertion] likewise on the excitation of Electricity

[deletion]- [person]person_032|Hawksbee[/person] was an indefatigable[/deletion]
[deletion]experimentalist & an accurate & candid[/deletion]
[deletion]narrator of his results; but he seems to[/deletion]
[deletion]have been seldom or never guided in his[/deletion]
[deletion]researches by any theoretical views.-[/deletion]
[deletion]- Delighted with his discoveries rather as [/deletion]
[deletion]amusing & striking phenomena - than as [/deletion]
[deletion]connected with the general doctrine[/deletion]
[deletion]of Science or the great Laws of Nature;-[/deletion]
he has drawn no conclusions from them,
[deletion]& made no applications.-[/deletion]
[deletion]- |_His book entitled "[otherwork]otherwork_231|physico mechanical[/otherwork] [/deletion]
[deletion]Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]" is however well worthy of perusal[/deletion]
[deletion]& is very entertaining - Curious appearances[/deletion]

for results infinitely [deletion]puzzling[/deletion] [insertion]perplexing[/insertion] to their discoverer
is an agreeable & useful exercise for the mind.
- With the labours of [person]person_032|Hawksbee[/person] the first
& earliest period of [underline]the Science[/underline] may be considered
as concluding.-
-|_ The facts at this time were insulated
no general principles had been discovered -
nothing more was known than that
certain bodies were capable of being made
to exhibit very wonderful powers by means
of friction.- Little was attained, &
nothing was hoped for; beyond what the
genius of [underline][person]person_383|Gilbert[/person][/underline] had so nobly anticipated. -
- In the beginning of the 18[superscript]th[/superscript] Century
|_[insertion]3[/insertion] the methods of philosophical research
attained their highest degree of perfection -
|_& the [underline]public mind[/underline] generally speaking
seems to have been in that [underline]happy state[/underline];
in which the imagination & activity of [underline]Youth[/underline]
are as it were chastened by the correctness
& sagacity of [underline]Manhood[/underline] 3 - _| |_But the [insertion]correct[/insertion] 

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00018|dnp01a218pp|91026528[/page]
objects of the philosophy of the [person]person_036|Newtonian[/person]
School absorbed for at least half a
century the attention of Scientific Men.-
- The grand Laws of the System
of the Universe, came upon the
understanding with that kind [insertion]of[/insertion] effect -
which the new sensations of vision
produced on the blind receiving Sight.-
(The mathematical philosophy &
astronomy; the laws of light, & the
motions of the heavenly bodies were
the universal topics of discussion &
admiration.- 3)
- Till the year 1730 Electricity
was wholly neglected |_& we owe
the revival of the enquiry to Stephen
[person]person_392|Grey[/person] a pensioner at the Charter House -
This person gave up his whole mind to
the enquiry, & pursued it with his
whole heart - he multiplied his
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with indefatigable industry;

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00019|dnp01a219pp|91026529[/page]
& through a period of nine years his papers
occupy a considerable place in the Phil. Trans.
of the Royal Society.-
- Amidst a great number of unconnected
facts & observations - Two discoveries of prime
importance occur - |_The power of electrified
bodies to communicate their influence to
other bodies - & the distinction between
[underline]conductors & nonconductors[/underline]. - |_ M[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_392|Grey[/person]
discovered the insulating apparatus & was
the first person who rendered Metals,
Water & the human body [underline]electrical[/underline] by
communication with excited instruments.-
- [person]person_392|Grey[/person] was a great benefactor of the
Science |_ but he was more distinguished
for liveliness, & perserverance in research,
than for accuracy & strength of thought -
His facts are infinitely more valuable than
his Theories - Having little general knowledge
of Science. - he erred, in what may be
called the critical philosophy of his
subject: |_ & attempted to explain

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00020|dnp01a220pp|91026530[/page]
Gravitation & other recondite powers
of matter by delusive electrical exp[superscript]ts[/superscript];
|_ thus affording an instance of the truth
of that Capital dogma of [person]person_138|Aristotle[/person]
[underline]" That those who know only one thing,[/underline]
[underline]find it easy to account for everything"[/underline]
- Stimulated by the first discoveries
of M[superscript]r[/superscript],, [person]person_392|Grey[/person] - Mons. [superscript]r[/superscript]. [person]person_393|du Fay[/person] intendant
of the French King's Gardens at Paris,
entered upon the same plan of
investigation " - repeated the different
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. made in [place]place_121|England[/place]; & added to
them various new ones connected with
brilliant & important results.-
- M. [person]person_393|du Fay[/person] was the first person
who distinguished the two electricities
under the name of [chemical]chemical_156|[underline]Resinous[/underline][/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_157|[underline]Vitreous[/underline][/chemical];
& he ascertained the very [underline]considerable[/underline]
principle "That bodies similary elec=
=trified repel each other - but that

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00021|dnp01a221pp|91026531[/page]
bodies dissimilarly electrified attracted
each other." - His discoveries are published
in eight memoirs delivered to the Academy
of Sciences & inserted in their History for
1733, 1734, & 1737. - |_ His writings display
a truly philosophical spirit - he has
attempted in all cases to generalise on
the phenomena:- |_ & patience & accuracy
seem to have [underline]regulated equally[/underline] his
[underline]practical[/underline] researches & his [underline]speculative[/underline]
views.- He refers the known facts to
a few propositions; |_& the germ of a
good elementary treatise may be found
in his principles; |_ He was an acute
& sagacious observer warped by few -
prejudices; led away by no fancies.-
- |_4 After the researches of [person]person_392|Grey[/person] &
[person]person_393|du Fay[/person] nothing that materially affected
the progress of the investigation was ascertained
till 1745; - the year of the [deletion]great[/deletion] discovery

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00022|dnp01a222pp|91026532[/page]
Which may be regarded as constituting the 3[superscript]d[/superscript]
Epoch in the Science
of the [underline][misc]misc_130|Leyden Phial[/misc][/underline] - |_ This extraordinary
apparatus was first employed by the
Canon [person]person_543|Von Kleist[/person] of Kamin; but a
similar combination was soon after [insertion]independently[/insertion] invented
by [person]person_704|Cuneus[/person] & [person]person_542|Muschenbroek[/person] of Leyden. -
- [person]person_543|Kleist[/person]'s form of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was a phial
held in the hand having a nail in it.-
Muschenbroeks' form was a phial half
filled with water.-
- Nothing in the history of Electricity
is more singular than the first accounts
of the [underline]electrical shock[/underline] as given by
these very feeble & imperfect instruments
|_ & the astonishment of the discoverers
seems to have almost deprived them
of their Reason.-
- [person]person_542|Muschenbroek[/person] in his account to the
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] written to [person]person_524|Reaumur[/person] - states " [underline]that[/underline]
[underline]the effect from a small glass bowl was[/underline]
[underline]so violent that he lost his breath & his[/underline]

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00023|dnp01a223pp|91026533[/page]
[underline]sensation & was two days before he recovered[/underline]
[underline]from the effects of the blow & the terror; &[/underline]
[underline]that he would not take a second shock[/underline]
[underline]for the whole Kingdom of France[/underline]"
- It does not require another example
to demonstrate how much the imagination
& the senses influence each other - |_Other
philosophers with a much more perfect &
more powerful apparatus, [underline]repeated the exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/underline]
without any such terrible effects; & referred
to the cowardice of the professor what
was truly only the effect of his surprise.-
- No simple philosophical discovery ever
excited so much popular & scientific
attention as this of the [misc]misc_130|Leyden Phial[/misc].-
The apparatus soon became an object of
public exhibition |_ & in the same year
in which it was discovered, a number
of itinerant experimenters procured

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00024|dnp01a224pp|91026534[/page]
a livelihood in different parts of
Europe by travelling from place to
place & showing the experiment.-
(And that singular species [underline]of curiosity[/underline]
[underline]natural[/underline] to the human mind, which
gives an interest to every thing just
within the limits of [underline]danger & of pain[/underline],
induced [underline]people[/underline] to give [underline]money[/underline] for
receiving a shock;- to [deletion]pay[/deletion] [insertion]long[/insertion] for a [underline]new[/underline]
though [insertion]a[/insertion] disagreeable sensation [insertion]4[/insertion] ) -
- The truly wonderful often gives
rise to the false marvellous.-
Whilst several enlightened persons
were engaged in investigating the
causes of the new phenomena:-
a great number of empirical
enquirers were misleading
themselves, or endeavouring to
mislead others by the most

[page]25|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00025|dnp01a225pp|91026535[/page]
extraordinary narrations of effects
produced by Electricity.- |_ For
two or three years the public
journals were filled with discussions
of miraculous Histories, which were
often advanced in one number
& exploded in the next, producing
a continual warfare between the
credulous & the reasonable - between
the ignorant & men of sense - between
quacks & philosophers.-
- Signior Pivati of Venice
published various accounts of
the medical effects of drugs
experienced by different persons
who were electrified by glass

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00026|dnp01a226pp|91026536[/page]
cylinders containing them;
& these assertions were repeated

5 |_About the middle of the
last century an immense number of
facts had been ascertained, & they were
constantly accumulating & some
principles had been developed;
but a general Theory for connecting
the insulated observations & giving
then the form of a Body of Science
was still wanting.- |_ The foundations
for this Theory were laid by the
ingenuity & industry of our
countryman [person]person_541|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Watson[/person]; the construction
of it is owing to the sagacity of [underline] [person]person_394|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Franklin [/person][/underline]

- " [person]person_541|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Watson[/person] ascertained that a commu =
=nication with the ground was necessary
for the production of a continued stream
of Electricity by the machine - And
hence he concluded that there was
an afflux of Electricity from the
conducting bodies to the glass; &
from the glass to the prime conductor.-
- This idea was made known early
in 1747 & toward the middle of
the same year D[superscript]r[/superscript]. [person]person_394|Franklin[/person] trans=
=mitted his first letter on the subject
to [person]person_539|M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Collinson[/person] containing an acc[superscript]t[/superscript],,
of experiments & observations on Electricity
made at [place]place_1073|Philadelphia[/place].-
- In this letter & in several subsequent
letters in a correspondence that continued
till 1754:- He brought forwards those
[underline]enlightened ideas of the subject which[/underline]
have been so generally admired &

[page]38|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00038|dnp01a238pp|91026548[/page]
adopted under the name of the
[underline]"Franklinean Theory"[/underline]. -
- - Dr. [person]person_394|Franklin[/person] proved that the
[underline]conductor[/underline] in contact with the rubber
of the electrical machine, had an
opposite electricity from that of the
great conductor;- That the outside
& the inside of the [misc]misc_130|Leyden Phial[/misc] were
likewise in opposite states;-
& that an equilibrium was
made by their mutual agency
& he referred all the phenomena
to the redundancy or deficiency
of a [underline]single fluid[/underline],-
- The experiments adduced
by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. [person]person_394|Franklin[/person] in support
of his Hypothesis, were most
ingeniously contrived & happily

executed.- |_A singular felicity of
induction guided all his researches;-
& by very small means, he established
[underline]Very grand truths.-[/underline]
- The style & manner of his publication
are almost as worthy of admiration as
the doctrines it contains - He has
endeavoured to remove all mystery
& obscurity from the subject - He
has written equally for the uninitia-
- ted & for the [underline]Philosopher[/underline] - &
He has rendered his [underline]details amusing[/underline]
as well as perspicious - elegant
as well as Simple. - |_ Science
appears in his language in
a dress wonderfully decorous

[page]40|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00040|dnp01a240pp|91026550[/page]
the last adapted to display
then nature loneliness.- He has
in no case exhibited that [underline]false[/underline]
[underline]dignity[/underline] by which Philosophy
is kept aloof from common
applications - but he has
sought rather to make her an
useful inmate & Servant in
the common habitations of Men
than to preserve her merely
as an object of admiration in
temples & palaces.-

submitted a great variety of the
conditions of Electrical action to
calculation - assuming as his Data
" an attraction between the electrical
fluid & common bodies " - & an
excess or a deficiency of the fluid
or of the matter over which it
is diffused.-
- A more popular & not less refined
view of the same [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]doctrine[/insertion] was soon
[underline]after furnished by [person]person_026|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish[/person]; who[/underline]

[underline]the same, exalted character, as those[/underline]
[underline]in the other departments of Nat.Philos[/underline]
- The magnificent effects produced
[underline]by the accumulation of Electricity by[/underline]
[underline]large machines & fans; soon led[/underline]
Philosophers to reason from artificial,
concerning natural processes;- Such
an influence it was impossible to
conceive [underline]passive[/underline] in the external
world; & the most [underline]striking[/underline]
[underline]analogies[/underline] soon led to the discovery
[underline]of its most obvious operations[/underline].-
- D[superscript]r[/superscript]. [person]person_537|Stukely[/person] in 1749 having

by the earthquakes which happened

- The simple apparatus of a

[underline]of a Silk Handkerchief, attached[/underline]
to a hempen string - with a key

47
had the glory of discovering a [underline]noble[/underline]
[underline]principle in Nature; & of making[/underline]
it of public utility.-
- The simple path once opened the
egg made to stand on its end - a great
number of Philosophers immediately
pursued the enquiry concerning atmos =
=pherical Electricity, & a general &
copious account of their researches may
be found in [otherwork]otherwork_163|Priestley's History[/otherwork] - 
- [person]person_480|Beccaria[/person] & M[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_086|Canton[/person] determined the
influence of changed strata of Air in
the phenomena of lightning - & the
Italian Philosopher made a number of
applications of Theory to the nature of
clouds, the affections of the winds, the
[misc]misc_216|Aurora Borealis[/misc] & other appearances.-
- Experiments on Thunder storms were
pursued by a variety of persons with
great zeal |_ & sometimes with too

[underline]little caution; |_ when it is considered[/underline]
what an untractable & powerful
Agent was concerned in the operations.-
- Amidst such a variety of trials
in different parts of Europe only one

one victim fell, in this [underline]dangerous[/underline]
[underline]field of research[/underline] -
- [person]person_536|Professor Rickman[/person] of [place]place_862|Petersburgh[/place]

which there are striking hints of later
discoveries - & after stating that
there may be still [deletion]discovered[/deletion] [insertion]found out[/insertion], new
& more powerful modes of exciting
electricity & of submitting bodies
to its operation - He concludes in
his usual animated manner;
"But whether this will be the indiviual
effect or not, philosophy by these curious
& successful researches has made a
valuable acquisition; since we may
be assured, that whatever tends to
disclose the [underline][nonenglish]nonenglish_200|causa rerum[/nonenglish][/underline], the secret
laws of Nature, cannot ultimately
fail of subjecting her, more or less,
to the uses of life; & of manifesting,
more & more, the wisdom & power

" This animal served them, ( meaning the
ancients) for an emblem or an hierogyphic,
for a figure of speech, or an allusion of
pleasantry; at best as a theme for a
copy of verses. But the world,
rising in years & in wisdom, rejects
such trifles. The interpreters of Nature,
in the adult state of Time, make
experiments & inductions, distrust
their intellects, confide in facts
if in their senses; & by these arts
drawing aside the veil of Nature,
find a mean & grovelling animal

- Most fortunately! The circumstance

On such an occasion it
is not easy to avoid feelings

[page]65|MS-DAVY-10102-000-00065|dnp01a265pp|91026575[/page]
to me in strict philosophical
justice that what has been

- It was in this Country immediately
after the first exhibition of
the [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] instrument in 1800
some of its most
remarkable chemical powers
were ascertained - It was here,
[deletion]in this country[/deletion] that the

was developed and it was
here that it received the

- The scientific glory of a
country may be considered
in some measure as an
indication of its innate
strength - The exaltation
of reason must necessarily
be connected with the
exaltation of the other
noble faculties of the mind,
& there is one spirit of
enterprize vigour & conquest
in Science, arts & Arms
