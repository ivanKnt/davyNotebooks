Heat in its state of absorption by Bodies
(as you will know,) is communicated
by direct contact & the cases of
communication constitute the law
of Temperature. -
When the equal quantities of
the same kind of matter of diff-
erent temperatures are brought
into contact till they acquire an
equilibrium - the degree of Heat
after communication [underline]must[/underline] [underline]necess[/underline]
- arily be an arithmetical mean
between the two original temperatures
Thus if one pound of mercury at
500 degrees be mixed with another
pound of mercury at 100 the
