latent Heat or Caloric of combination -
Water at all temperatures between
212Â°and 32 seems to be possessed of
the same capacity for heat and
its powers of communicating Heat to
bodies may under these circumst-
-ances be determined by calculation. -
When however it is cooled below
32 so as to become ice its capacity
instantly diminishes but the con-
-trary effect takes place when
it is converted into steam for in
this case its capacity is wonderfully
increased. -
During the conversion of [underline]ice[/underline]
into water there is always a
very considerable diminution of
