Heat or the power of repulsion may be
considered as the [underline]antagonist[/underline] power to the
attraction of cohesion, the one tending
to separate, the other to unite the parts
of bodies. & the forms of bodies depend
upon their respective agencies. -
In solids the attractive force predominates
over the repulsive; in fluids & in
elastic fluids they may be regarded as
in different states of equilibrium; & in
etherial substances the repulsive power
must be considered as predominating
over & destroying the attractive force. -

Heat in its state of absorption by Bodies
(as you will know,) is communicated
by direct contact & the cases of
communication constitute the law
of Temperature. -
When the equal quantities of
the same kind of matter of diff-
erent temperatures are brought
into contact till they acquire an
equilibrium - the degree of Heat
after communication [underline]must[/underline] [underline]necess[/underline]
- arily be an arithmetical mean
between the two original temperatures
Thus if one pound of mercury at
50[deletion]0[/deletion] degrees be mixed with another
pound of mercury at 100 the

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00004|dnp01a304pp|92014987[/page]

resulting temperature is 75 [deletion]and it is[/deletion]
[deletion]on this necessary Law as I mentioned[/deletion]
[deletion]in my last lecture that the[/deletion] indica -
[deletion]tions of the accuracy of the scale of[/deletion]
[deletion]the mercurial thermometer are[/deletion] founded
When two unequal quantities of the
same species of Bodies of different
[underline]temperatures[/underline] are made to act upon
each other - In this case their Heat
is divided according to their respective
temperatures & quantities of matter -
Thus 1 pound of mercury at 50 &
two pounds at 100° will produce a
mean temperature of about 83. -
And in all cases (there is
the same [underline]principle[/underline] with regard to
the communication of Heat in the

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00005|dnp01a305pp|92014990[/page]
7.
same species of matter; but with diff-
-erent species there is a different law. -
Thus if equal weight of water at
50 & of gold at 150° be brought in
contact and be agitated till they
acquire a common temperature. this
temperature will not be found to
be the arithmetical mean 100° but
it will be 55° -
|_ With other bodies there are still
greater differences & in common Phi-
-losophical Language these differe-
nces are said to to depend upon
their [underline]capacity for Heat[/underline]. -
The [underline]Capacity[/underline] of a Body for Heat
is said to be great or small

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00006|dnp01a306pp|92014993[/page]
8
in proportion as its temperature is
more or less raised by the addition
or diminished by the subtraction -
of equal quantities of Heat - Thus
in the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] just mentioned; in
which the quantity of gold is said
to be at 150° & the equal quantity
of water 50, & the resulting tempe-
eratures 55° - It follows that the
water gains 5 only whilst the gold
looses 95 so that the capacity of
water is very much greater than
that of gold - as indeed 95 to 5
or as 19 to 1.-
Aeriform substances in general
have much greater capacities for

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00007|dnp01a307pp|92014995[/page]
9
heat than fluids, & fluids than Solids:
And in the communication of the
Heat of the Globe - |_ the Atmosphere
and the ocean in receiving Heat
from the Solid parts undergo a
slight elevation only of temperatu-
-ure; and are constantly prep-
-ared by their great [insertion]mobility[/insertion] [deletion]attracting[/deletion]
[deletion]powers[/deletion], - to restore the equilibrium
of communicated Heat and to pre-
-vent its detrimental excess. -
Bodies besides being differently
affected in temperature by the add-
ition of the same quantity of Heat
have likewise another property with
regard to it. -

They [underline]give it out[/underline] and receive it on
[underline]contact with very different degrees of[/underline]
[underline]quickness[/underline] -
Thus a piece of Metal held near
a candle will become [insertion]Heated[/insertion] much sooner
[overwritten]Heated[/overwritten] [overwrite]than[/overwrite] a piece of glass - This power
is called the conducting power
with regard to heat & the metal
is said to be a better conductor
than the glass. -
In general the Bodies that have
the least capacity for Heat are the
best conductors & vice versa. -
Thus metals conduct better than
glass or stoney Substances - Solids better
than fluids and fluids better than
Gases. -
It is not possible to touch without

11
a painful sensation a piece of metal at
170° - and air at a temperature above 212°
above the boiling point of water; is very
supportable. -
This last assertion is proved by many
curious exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] - In Dr Fordyces Heated
Rooms. -
Sir Joseph Banks remained exp-
-osed to a temperature in which
water boild for several minutes: &
Sir Ch[superscript]s[/superscript] Blagden and D[superscript]r[/superscript] Solander
made similar trials; and suffered
principally from oppressed respir-
-ation; but no Scalding or Burning
from the contact of air - In these
cases [deletion]he[/deletion] [insertion]they[/insertion] could not touch water
when introduced into the chamber
and their metallic Buttons and

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00010|dnp01a310pp|92015005[/page]
12
watch chains immediately burnt their
hands. - In sugar houses and still more
more frequently in glass houses the work
men remain long exposed to Air of
very high temperatures. - In a glass
House at Bristol where I was superint
ending the execution of some of my
apparatus for philosophical purpose; &
had the curiosity to ascertain by
the thermometer the Heat of the place
in which one of the workmen was
whilst taking the melting glass out
of the pot - The Thermometer suspen-
-ded in the air indicated 257.-45
degrees above the [underline]boiling point[/underline]
[underline]of water[/underline]
The person informed me that

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00011|dnp01a311pp|92015008[/page]
13
we could stand there for two or three
minutes only - The interior of the
Glass House at the height of 3 feet
above the ground out of the reach
of the currents of cold air was
in most places above 110-° - These
temperatures though not immed-
-iately destructive injure considerably
the Health of the workmen who
in general are very short lived. -
Furnaces of a new construction
exposed to the free air are however
I am happy to say coming into use
and with the most beneficial effects. -
|_ The Bodies that [underline]give our their[/underline] heat
with facility, likewise [underline]receive it[/underline], with

14
facility & the converse - The term
[underline]bad[/underline] or good [underline]conductor[/underline] applies to both
cases equally.
Thus water is colder to the touch at
40° than air at 20° -
[deletion]As I mentioned in the last lecture[/deletion]
Metals [insertion]for instance[/insertion] at very low temperatures
at the point of congelation of qui-
cksilver cannot be applied to the hands
without injury - So rapidly do they
[overwritten]So rapidly[/overwritten] [overwrite]abstract Heat[/overwrite] of the Body; But
fur & [insertion]woolen and linen[/insertion] clothing, very bad conductors,
produce no such effects; And the
whole body may be exposed to
[underline]air[/underline] at 60° below 0° even with-
out any permanent inconvenience
& this degree of cold has been

15
experienced by Professor Pallas in Siberia
and by different Persons, who have
passed the Winter in the northern
parts of A[deletion]m[/deletion]merica.-
Moist air conducts Heat much
better than dry air. Thus D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Fordyce in his heated room
found that He could support
for some minutes the tempera-
ture of 260° when no substances
capable of furnishing moisture
were present - & this of high
degree of heat was not much
more offensive than a temper-
-ature below 200 when water

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00014|dnp01a314pp|92015017[/page]
16
was present. -
In keen frosts when the Air is
very dry the sensation of cold is
often much less experienced than in
damp [deletion]& it is[/deletion] weather which is popularly and proper-
-ly called [underline]Raw weather[/underline], when the
thermometer is many degrees higher
And the unhealthiness of living
during the winter in moist situ
-ations probably in a great measure
depends upon the too high condu-
-cting power of the damp air. -

The property which I just have desc-
ribed the capacity of a body re-
-mains uniform as long as it re-
-tains its primitive [overwritten]form[/overwritten] [overwrite]state[/overwrite] of agg-
-regation that is to say if it is
a solid if it is fluid as long as
it remains so; and the like of
the rest; but if it changes its
Form - that is if a Solid becomes
a Fluid or [insertion]a fluid[/insertion] a Solid [deletion]a Fluid[/deletion], the
capacity immediately alters and
in this case it gives out or receiv-
-es that Heat which in consequence
of its peculiar relation to the Heat
of temperature is usually called

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00016|dnp01a316pp|92015022[/page]
18
latent Heat or Caloric of combination -
Water at all temperatures between
212°and 32 seems to be possessed of
the same capacity for heat and
its powers of communicating Heat to
bodies may under these circumst-
-ances be determined by calculation. -
When however it is cooled below
32 so as to become ice its capacity
instantly diminishes but the con-
-trary effect takes place when
it is converted into steam for in
this case its capacity is wonderfully
increased. -
During the conversion of [underline]ice[/underline]
into water there is always a
very considerable diminution of

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00017|dnp01a317pp|92015025[/page]
[deletion]19[/deletion]
temperature of the surrounding bodies
And if a pound of heated water at 172°
and a pound of ice at 32° [insertion]be mixed together[/insertion] there is no
increase of temperature, & the excess of the
Heat of the warm water disappears
altogether as Heat of Fluidity or as latent
Heat. -

[deletion][underline]Water[/underline].[/deletion]
Solids then evidently in becoming
Fluids absorb a large proportion of
of Heat The case is the same when
fluids have their capacity increased

by becoming aeriform. -
The evaporation of Ether which is
its conversion [deletion]of[/deletion] into an aeriform
Fluid cools considerably the bodies
in contact and water may be
made ice by the cold so produced
Instance
If water be heated to 250° in Papins
digister the moment steam escapes
by opening the valve it instantly
carries off Heat and reduces the
temperature 212° -
On the contrary during
the conversion of Gases into fluids
or Fluids into Solids Heat is evolved
Thus when ice is formed at
degrees below 30° the temperature

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00019|dnp01a319pp|92015031[/page]
21
of the surrounding bodies are always
raised. Heat is given out in the
process
The same doctrine will apply
with some limitation to the changes
in the forms of Bodies produced
by chemical attraction.-
If a Sol: of Sulphuric Acid and
a solution of Potash be mixed
together a solid salt wil be
formed the capacity diminished
and considerable Heat evolved
When Snow & muriate of Lime
are mixed together; which being
Solid by affinity become fluid
cold is the result they absorb
Heat from the surrounding

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10103-000-00020|dnp01a320pp|92015034[/page]
Bodies and that to such a great
extent as to lower the thermometer
70° or 80° and by such a mixture
mercury may be congealed.-
When a Solid compound of Bismuth
and Mercury, & one of Mercury &
Lead are mixed the whole becomes
fluid and cold is the result
An infinite number of other
instances of the same kind might
be found - The exceptions are
comparatively few - The principle
is generally applicable [underline]to the[/underline]
great series of chemical phenomena -

|_ And it is most exerted when

|_ In the condensation of Aqueous

|_The congelation of water is con-

the different parts of the system
they possess within themselves the
power of resisting to a great extent
the common communication of
heat and retain their own
uniform temperature.
Thus in the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] just now
mentioned of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Fordyce and
Sir Ch[superscript]s[/superscript] Blagden though the
body was exposed to a heat above
212° the thermometer placed in

scarcely superior to the natural
one - And after D[superscript]r[/superscript] Fordyce
