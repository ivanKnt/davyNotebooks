- The proportions in which
Ammonia combines with [insertion]common[/insertion] acids
are [deletion]reg[/deletion] regulated by the
proportions of Hydrogene it
8 contains. - Thus if we
combine Nitric acid &
Ammonia; the quantities
must be such that all
the hydrogene of the Ammonia
must be converted into water
by oxygene from the acid.
& that the [deletion]Nitrogene[/deletion] [insertion]Azote[/insertion] may
remain combined with another
proportion of oxygene. - Hence Nitrate
of Ammonia is always an acid
salt [deletion]for as Nitric acid[/deletion]
[deletion]consists of [deletion]4[/deletion] 1 of Nitrogene & [deletion]four[/deletion] 2[/deletion]
[deletion]oxygene & Ammonia of [deletion]2[/deletion]3 Hydrogene[/deletion]
[deletion]& 1 Nitrogene there must[/deletion]
[deletion]be an excess of acid to enable[/deletion]
