[deletion]for if Nitrogene[/deletion] [insertion]Azote[/insertion] must in
this [deletion]notion[/deletion] [insertion]view[/insertion] be regarded as
owing its powers of absorbing
oxygene / to Hydrogene; & consequently
the metal of Ammonia must
contain at least [deletion]8[/deletion] [insertion]16[/insertion] proportions
of Hydrogen to [insertion]about[/insertion] [deletion]7.5[/deletion] 15 of other
matter - As potassium
absorbs three proportions
of oxygene; & likewise
[deletion]combines[/deletion] unites to 1 [insertion]proportion of[/insertion] [deletion]oxymuriatic[/deletion] [unclear]clorine[/unclear]
gas, & six of oxygene. - It
may be regarded as consisting
