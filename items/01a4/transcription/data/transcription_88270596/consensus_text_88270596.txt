of another element; the phenomena
perfect metals would contain
from twice to three times
as much basis to 1 or 2 or 3
of Hydrogene; - & all would
contain different proportions;
- And both their specific
gravity & combustibility
would be exactly what
might be expected on such
an hypothesis; - Those containing
most basis being the heaviest
those containing most hydrogene
being the lightest. There
is no principle in chemistry
more certainly develloped.
- that the same quantity of
one ingredient is attracted
much more strongly by two
