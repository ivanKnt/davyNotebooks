[unclear]xx[/unclear] in these ideas it is easy to account
for the [insertion]corespondence between the[/insertion] [underline]diminution[/underline] of the temperature
of the atmosphere & its height;
for if it be conceived that
the capacity of [deletion]rare[/deletion] air rarefied
by heat increases as it ascends,

the heat [deletion][insertion]which it received above x[/insertion][/deletion] of temperature [deletion]at[/deletion] which
was the cause of its ascent must at
a certain elevation become heat
of capacity; & the [deletion]higher we ascend[/deletion]
higher & more rarefied the air
the more [deletion]is[/deletion] it is removed from the
source of the heat; & the greater its
power of diminishing temperature

A very curious phaenomenon [deletion]occurs in[/deletion] [insertion]is produced[/insertion]
[insertion]during the action of the[/insertion] the fountain of Hiero at Schemnitz
in Hungary; the air [insertion]in the machine[/insertion] is compressed
by a column of water 260 feet high
& when a stop cock is opened so
as to suffer air to escape its sudden
rarefaction produces a degree of cold
which not only precipitates aqueous vapour
but causes to congeal in a shower of
snow & the pipe from which the air
issues become covered with icicles -
