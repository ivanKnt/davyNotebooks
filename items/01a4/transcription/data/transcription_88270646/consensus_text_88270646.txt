A piece of iron made red hot by
hammering cannot be strongly heated
a second time [insertion]by the same means[/insertion] unless it has been
previously introduced into a fire - This
fact has been explained by sup-
-posing that the fluid of heat has
been pressed out of it, by the percuss-
-ion which is recovered in the fire;
but this a very rude mechanical
idea - The arrangements of its parts
are altered by hammering in this
way, and it is rendered brittle.
By a moderate degree of friction;
the same piece of metal may
be Kept hot for any length of time,
so that if heat be pressed out the
quantity must be inexhaustible -
