matter must [underline]have space[/underline] between them

inference that its own particles
are possessed of motion; but as
there is no change in the position
of its parts as long as its temperature
is uniform, the motion if it exists
must be [underline]a vibrating [deletion]one[/deletion] or[/underline] undu-
[underline]-latory motion,[/underline] or a motion of the
particles round round their axis
or a motion of particles round
each other -
