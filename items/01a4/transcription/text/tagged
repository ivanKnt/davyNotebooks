- The proportions in which

are [deletion]reg[/deletion] regulated by the

8 contains. - Thus if we
combine [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] &
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]; the quantities
must be such that all

In all chemical changes there is
an alteration of temperature and
in most instances when gasses
become fluids or fluids solids
there is an increase of tempera-
ture & vice versa, there is usually
a diminution of temperature when
solids become fluids, or fluids, solids,
For instance when the highly

inflammable substance called [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical]
the properties of which will be hereafter
described is burnt in the air, it
is found to condense a particular
part of the air & a high temperature
is produced during the process -

When a Solid amalgam of [chemical]chemical_187|Bismuth[/chemical]
and a solid amalgam of lead
substances which will be noticed
in that part of this work relating
to the metallic [insertion]compounds[/insertion] are mixed together
they become fluid & the Thermometer
sinks during the time of their
action -
There are however a number of cases

in which though gaseous bodies or fluids
are formed from solids an increase

of temperature occurs - Thus in
the explosion of Gunpowder a large

quantity of [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] matter is diseng-

And there is an instance in which
at the time of the separation of two
species of gaseous matter from each
other which is connected with ex-
-pansion, there is an increase of tem-
- perature - Thus when a little of the
gas which I have named [chemical]chemical_307|Euchlorine[/chemical]

called by the [misc]misc_012|French chemists[/misc] oxymu-

or gases and the increase of temperature
connected with the condensation of gases
and fluids; but there are other facts
which are not so easily reconciled
to the opinion; such [insertion]are[/insertion] the production
of heat by friction & percussion &
some of the chemical changes which
have been just refferred to -
When the temperature of bodies are
raised by friction there seems
to be no diminution of their
capacities using the word in its com-
-mon sense & in many chemical
changes connected with an increase
of temperature - there appears to be
likewise an increase of capacity

A piece of iron made red hot by
hammering cannot be strongly heated
a second time [insertion]by the same means[/insertion] unless it has been
previously introduced into a fire - This
fact has been explained by sup-
-posing that the fluid of heat has
been pressed out of it, by the percuss-
-ion which is recovered in the fire;
but this a very rude mechanical
idea - The arrangements of its parts
are altered by hammering in this
way, and it is rendered brittle.
By a moderate degree of friction;
the same piece of metal may
be Kept hot for any length of time,
so that if heat be pressed out the
quantity must be inexhaustible -

When any body is cooled it occupies a
smaller volume than before - It is evident
6
therefore that its parts must have
approached towards each other; when
the body is expanded by heat, it
33
is equally evident that its parts
must have separated from each
other - The immediate cause of
the phenomena of heat then is
motion - and the laws of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] com-
-munication are precisely the
same as the laws of the communi-
-cation of motion -
Since all matter may be made
to fill a smaller volume by cooling
it is evident that the particles of

matter must [underline]have space[/underline] between them
and since [underline]every body[/underline] can communi-
-cate the power of expansion, to a
body of a lower temperature, that
is, can give an expansive motion
to its particles, it is a probable
inference that its own particles
are possessed of motion; but as
there is no change in the position
of its parts as long as its temperature
is uniform, the motion if it exists
must be [underline]a vibrating [deletion]one[/deletion] or[/underline] undu-
[underline]-latory motion,[/underline] or a motion of the
particles round round their axis
or a motion of particles round
each other -
