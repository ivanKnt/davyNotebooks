- The proportions in which
Ammonia combines with [insertion]common[/insertion] acids
are [deletion]reg[/deletion] regulated by the
proportions of Hydrogene it

combine Nitric acid &
Ammonia; the quantities
must be such that all

must be converted into water
by oxygene from the acid.
& that the [deletion]Nitrogene[/deletion] [insertion]Azote[/insertion] may
remain combined with another
proportion of oxygene. - Hence Nitrate

In all chemical changes there is

there is an increase of tempera-

a diminution of temperature when
solids become fluids, or fluids, solids,

[deletion][underline]caloric[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]& that of vibratory motions communicable [insertion]from body to Body[/insertion][/insertion]
many of the phenomena admit of

or gases and the increase of temperature
connected with the condensation of gases
and fluids; but there are other facts
which are not so easily reconciled
to the opinion; such [insertion]are[/insertion] the production
of heat by friction & percussion &
some of the chemical changes which
have been just refferred to -
When the temperature of bodies are
raised by friction there seems
to be no diminution of their
capacities using the word in its com-
-mon sense & in many chemical
changes connected with an increase
of temperature - there appears to be
likewise an increase of capacity

A piece of iron made red hot by
hammering cannot be strongly heated
a second time [insertion]by the same means[/insertion] unless it has been
previously introduced into a fire - This
fact has been explained by sup-
-posing that the fluid of heat has
been pressed out of it, by the percuss-
-ion which is recovered in the fire;
but this a very rude mechanical
idea - The arrangements of its parts
are altered by hammering in this
way, and it is rendered brittle.
By a moderate degree of friction;
the same piece of metal may
be Kept hot for any length of time,
so that if heat be pressed out the
quantity must be inexhaustible -

When any body is cooled it occupies a
smaller volume than before - It is evident
6
therefore that its parts must have
approached towards each other; when
the body is expanded by heat, it
33
is equally evident that its parts
must have separated from each
other - The immediate cause of
the phenomena of heat then is
motion - and the laws of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] com-
-munication are precisely the
same as the laws of the communi-
-cation of motion -
Since all matter may be made
to fill a smaller volume by cooling
it is evident that the particles of

60 61
matter must [underline]have space[/underline] between them
and since [underline]every body[/underline] can communi-
-cate the power of expansion, to a
body of a lower temperature, that
is, can give an expansive motion
to its particles, it is a probable
inference that its own particles
are possessed of motion; but as
there is no change in the position
of its parts as long as its temperature
is uniform, the motion if it exists
must be [underline]a vibrating [deletion]one[/deletion] or[/underline] undu-
[underline]-latory motion,[/underline] or a motion of the
particles round round their axis
or a motion of particles round
each other -
