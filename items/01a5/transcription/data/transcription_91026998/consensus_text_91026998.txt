is of [underline]the nature of the motions[/underline] or
[underline]affections of radiant matter[/underline]
Two hypotheses have been [deletion]examined[/deletion] [insertion]invented[/insertion] to
account for the principal operations
of radiant matter. In the first it
is supposed that the universe contains
a highly rare & elastic substance which
when put into a state of undulation
produces these effects on our organs of sight
which constitute the sensations of vision
& the other phaenomena occasioned by solar
[deletion]solar[/deletion] & [deletion]elastic[/deletion] [insertion]terrestrial rays[/insertion] [deletion]light[/deletion] In the second
it is conceived that particles are emitted
or put off from luminous or heat making
bodies with great velocity & that they
produce the effects by communicating their
motions to [deletion]bodies[/deletion] [insertion]substances[/insertion] or by entering into
them & changing their composition.-
- The first of the suppositions was adopted
by [person_165]Higgins[/person_165], Hooke & Euler; the second by
Newton & [deletion]by[/deletion] the philosophers of the newtonian
school. [deletion]Most[/deletion] [insertion]Many[/insertion] of the phaenomena
may be accounted for by either hypothesis
but the newtonian doctrine applies
much more happily to most of the [deletion]phaenomena[/deletion]
