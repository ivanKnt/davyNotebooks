facts lately discovered respecting the modifications
of light by double refraction & reflection.
- Indeed it does not seem possible to account
for the circumstance that [deletion]ext extraordinary[/deletion] a
[deletion]refracted[/deletion] ray which has suffered extraordinary
refraction in passing through one [deletion]or of[/deletion] chrystal
should suffer ordinary refraction in passing
through another like chrystal on the idea
of the effect being a mere undulation
of the ethereal medium; but it may
be [deletion]easily[/deletion] explained by supposing the
rays to consist of particles endowed
with rectilineal motion & possessed of a
certain polarity that is an attraction
for [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] some surfaces of the chrystal &
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] a repulsion for others. -
M Malus has given a very ingenious
theory for the explication of these
phaenomena by supposing that the
molecules [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]producing[/insertion] light are possessed of
three rectangular axes of which
one is always in the direction
of the ray [deletion]of[/deletion] the other two are
made by the influence of the repulsive
forces exerted by the chrystaline medium
perpendicular to the direction
of these forces; & such a firm
& such an effect would correspond
