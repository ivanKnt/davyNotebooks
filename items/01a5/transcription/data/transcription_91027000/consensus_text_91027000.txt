[deletion]As of[/deletion] the coloured rays separated
by the prism bear the same relation
to double refraction [insertion]that[/insertion] [deletion]as with light[/deletion]
direct light [insertion]beam[/insertion] it follows that
their polarity must be of the

be actually composed of [deletion]different[/deletion]
the rays producing different colours
The case may be conceived to be
analogous to those of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] &
[deletion]chrystaline[/deletion] bodies possessed of
electrical polarity & regular chrystaline
forms. - When a tourmaline is
broken into pieces the pieces are
found to possess similar electrical
power to the original chrystal &
a [insertion]large[/insertion] rhomb of calcerous spar easily
breaks into a number of similar
rhombs. -
