is of [underline]the nature of the motions[/underline] or
[underline]affections of radiant matter[/underline]
Two hypotheses have been [deletion]explained[/deletion] [insertion]invented[/insertion] to
account for the principal operations
of radiant matter. In the first it
is supposed that the universe contains
a highly rare & elastic substance which
when put into a state of undulation
produces these effects on our organs of sight
which constitute the sensations of vision
& the other phaenomena occasioned by solar
[deletion]solar[/deletion] & [deletion]elastic[/deletion] [insertion]terrestrial rays[/insertion] [deletion]light[/deletion] In the second
it is conceived that particles are emitted
or sent off from luminous or heat making
bodies with great velocity & that they
produce their effects by communicating their
motions to [deletion]bodies[/deletion] [insertion]substances[/insertion] or by entering into
them & changing their composition.-
- The first of the suppositions was adopted
by [person]person_165|Higgins[/person], [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] & [person]person_933|Euler[/person]; the second by
[person]person_036|Newton[/person] & [deletion]by[/deletion] the philosophers of the [person]person_036|Newtonian[/person]
school. [deletion]Most[/deletion] [insertion]Many[/insertion] of the phaenomena
may be accounted for by either hypothesis
but the [person]person_036|Newtonian[/person] doctrine applies
much more happily to most of the [deletion]phaenomena[/deletion]

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10105-000-00002|dnp01a502pp|91026999[/page]
facts lately discovered respecting the modifications
of light by double refraction & reflection.
- Indeed it does not seem possible to account
for the circumstance that [deletion]ext extraordinary[/deletion] a
[deletion]refracted[/deletion] ray which has suffered extraordinary
refraction in passing through one [deletion]or of[/deletion] chrystal
should suffer ordinary refraction in passing
through another like chrystal on the idea
of the effect being a mere undulation
of the ethereal medium; but it may
be [deletion]easily[/deletion] explained by supposing the
rays to consist of particles endowed
with rectilineal motion & possessed of a
certain polarity that is an attraction
for [deletion]certain[/deletion] some surfaces of the chrystal &
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] a repulsion for others. -
M [person]person_318|Malus[/person] has given a very ingenious
theory for the explication of these
phaenomena by supposing that the
molecules [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]producing[/insertion] light are possessed of
three rectangular axes of which
one is always in the direction
of the ray [deletion]of[/deletion] the other two are
made by the influence of the repulsive
forces exerted by the chrystaline medium
perpendicular to the direction
of these forces; & such a firm
& such an effect would correspond

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10105-000-00003|dnp01a503pp|91027000[/page]
with the idea of the luminous particles
being octaedrons.-
As [deletion]its[/deletion] the colored rays separated
by the prism bear the same relation
to double refraction [insertion]that[/insertion] [deletion]as with light[/deletion]
direct light [insertion]bears[/insertion] it follows that
their polarity must be of the
same kind & this is what might
be expected if [deletion]the solar beam[/deletion] [insertion]direct light[/insertion]
[deletion]be composed of[/deletion]
be actually composed of [deletion]different[/deletion]
the rays producing different colours
The case may be conceived to be
analogous to those of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] &
[deletion]chrystaline[/deletion] bodies possessed of
electrical polarity & regular chrystaline
forms. - When a [chemical]chemical_324|Tourmaline[/chemical] is
broken into pieces the pieces are
found to possess similar electrical
powers to the original chrystal &
a [insertion]large[/insertion] rhomb of [chemical]chemical_406|Calcareous Spar[/chemical] easily
breaks into a number of similar
rhombs. -
