            <note>A Scottish scientific instrument maker who studied with the chemist Joseph Black at Glasgow University. He developed the separate condenser for steam engines which increased their effieciency significantly. He took out a twenty-five-year patent (ending in 1800) and moved to Birmingham where he went into partnership with the businessman and industrialist Matthew Boulton. They made their fortune by having an effective monopoly of manufacturing steam engines. A friend of Thomas Beddoes, he met Davy on a number of occasions and Davy gave the oration at the unveiling of Watt's statue in Greenock. FRSL.</note>

            <note>French chemist and tax farmer (for which he was guillotined). Developed a new nomenclature for chemistry (much of which is still in use today) and argued strongly against the existence of phlogiston. Davy read some of his writings while in Cornwall which he then opposed and throughout his career maintained an ambivalent attitude towards Lavoisierian chemisty. ForMemRSL.</note>
