Air - [deletion]but D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley attempted[/deletion] [insertion]but this moisture was generally[/insertion] to
[deletion]shew that this[/deletion] beleived to be water
which had been dissolved by the
gas; & it was not till the
summer of 1781, that the fact was
properly understood. - At this
time M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish in a process
conceived with his usual sagacity
& executed with his usual precision
showed that when common Air
& Hydrogene were exploded together in
the proportion of 2 1/2 to 1 the product
was pure water" which exactly
corresponded in weight to the
Gasses consumed. - And M[superscript]r[/superscript] Watt
reasoning on this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [underline]formed the[/underline]
conclusion "that water consisted of
pure & inflammable air deprived
of the greatest portion of their latent
Heat. -
- The discovery was generally admitted;

& the French Chemists it became the principle
basis of [deletion]that Antiphlogistic[/deletion] Generalisation
which has been since called the
Antiphlogistic Theory & formed the
most impressive & convincing fact of
the Doctrine. -
