converted into Oxygene & Hydrogene:
And in allowing that these substances
are its constituent principles; it
becomes easy to conceive that
their assumption of the elastic form
is owing to the intense Heat
communicated by the [underline]Spark[/underline]. -
- The [underline]production[/underline], of Water, by Electricity
from Oxygene & Hydrogene is still more
distinct than the phaenomena of
its decomposition
When the gasses produced from pure
water by the spark are [deletion]again[/deletion] acted
upon by it in their mingled state
they explode. Heat & light are
evolved & they resume the fluid
form. -
- The case is the same when
1 parts of oxygene [insertion]from manganese[/insertion], & 2 of hydrogene [insertion]from iron filings[/insertion] are
inflamed together
or more accurately "when the aeriform
form substances are perfectly pure"
-100 parts of oxygene & 205 of hydrogene
- In this case
