- At the first view it appears very extraordinary
that the same influence Electricity - should
[insertion]possess the power[/insertion] both of compounding & of decompounding; & though
exhibited in the same form; yet produce
such very different effects - Our surprise
however must cease "When the difference
of its operation when elastic & nonelastic
fluid is considered. it is in this that
we must search for the solution of
the difficulty. -
Water is a very bad conductor of Heat
& [insertion] incompressible &[/insertion] when electricity passes through it in
the form of fire; there is great reason
to believe that the particles in the sphere

must be instantaneous - & the high ignition

the production of permanent elastic fluid.
- In aeriform matter the effect must be
very different. [deletion]A[/deletion] Gases are compressible - And
the intense Heat of the spark acting as

expand the matter through which it passes; &
this [underline]expansion[/underline] taking place with surprising
velocity; will not give a mechanical
impulse to the whole of the surrounding
particles; but will act upon the immediately
