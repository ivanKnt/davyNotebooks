contiguous gases as a [underline]compressing force[/underline]; And as such
[insertion]force[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] by approximately [underline]their[/underline] particles; may
be the means of their combination. -
- I develope this theory as the
one that appears most probable; it occured
to me in consequence of the late exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of M. Biot on compression - In these
experiments as I before stated, Water
was formed by the the stroke of
a condensing pump " from a due mixture
of the two gases. Here the agency
[underline]was mechanical[/underline]; & the particles being
brought nearer to each other ceased
to be mutually explosive & were brought
within the limits of elective affinity.-
- That an infinitely rapid expansion
of one part of a gas must produce
a compression of the contiguous elastic
matter is evident from the common
laws of the communication of motion.
|_ The limits of the exertion of the force
[deletion]could increase[/deletion] & the [deletion]increase[/deletion] [insertion]escalation[/insertion] of its
strength would increase together with
[underline]the velocity[/underline] - |_ the portion of time
in which electricity acts at the [insertion]greatest distance[/insertion] is too
minute to be measured; & the
[underline]compressing[/underline] power resulting from its expansive
[underline]agency on[/underline] gases may consequently be conceived
to be almost infinitely [underline]great[/underline].-
