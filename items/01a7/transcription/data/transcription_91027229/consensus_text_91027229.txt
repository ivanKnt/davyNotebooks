a phaenomenon similar but rather more
complicated occurs in the action
of Dilut Muriatic Acid -
Instance
Muriatic Acid not decomposable
Iron dissolved
[underline]& c.[/underline]
- In all experiments upon the decomposition or composition
of [deletion]Water[/deletion] water, I have mentioned that
[deletion]the C & O[/deletion] in order to produce [underline]perfect[/underline] results
[deletion]effects[/deletion] the fluid or the gases ought
[underline]to be pure[/underline]. - They can however by
the the usual methods seldom be obtained
in a absolute state of purity -
Water even after being distilled [deletion]cold[/deletion] &
put into a close bottle whilst warm
still contains a little common Air; &
this is partly disengaged during the
action of the electrical Spark; & mixes
in minute proportions with the oxygene
& Hydrogene, evolved; but this [deletion]of[/deletion] of course
cannot be said to affect the rationale
of the process & in proportion as the
water is more free from [underline]foreign air[/underline] so
in proportion are its two constituent parts
obtained in a state [deletion]of[/deletion] approaching near to
 perfect purity; & even in common [deletion]clear[/deletion] [insertion]distilled[/insertion] water
when the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] is made over mercury the
contamination is seldom to 100 part when
the gases evolved equal the water in
Volume.
