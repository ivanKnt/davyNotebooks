In producing gases in our artificial processes
it is scarcely ever possible to free the
vessels in which operations are performed
entirely from common Air & hence there
is usually a portion of Nitrogene
more or less minute mixed with the
oxygene and Hydrogene in exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
composition of Water. - In the case
of slow combustion however; or when
the Hydrogene is more than sufficient to
saturate the Oxygene this is of no
importance; but in processes of detonation
when there is present more Oxygene
than is sufficient to condense the
Hydrogene, a little Nitrous Acid is
formed; but this arises (as will
shewn [deletion]here[/deletion] after) from a combination
between the [deletion]oxygene/deletion] oxygene not employed
to form Water & the free Nitrogene.
- I mention[deletion]ed[/deletion] these facts because they

when accurately considered they offer
