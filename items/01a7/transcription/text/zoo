No [underline]Natural Substance[/underline] presents a more important
series of investigations to the Chemist & Philosopher
than [underline]Water[/underline]: the object; so constantly presented
to us; & the Uses & effects of which
are so familiar. -
The appearances of this fluid are simple
& uniform: |_ & when we consider the immense
Quantities in which it is found, & its
almost universal Agencies - it is easy to
conceive how [underline]those ideas[/underline] were [deletion]conceived[/deletion] formed
according to which it was so long
supposed to be the most active & the
most perfect of the [underline]Elements[/underline]. -
- [underline]"Water[/underline] is the best" says the great
[person_842]Lyric poet[/person_842] of the Greeks: & by this He
evidently meant to express the doctrine
of [underline]Thales[/underline] "that it was "the great &
active principle of Nature" an opinion
which has been often supported: &
which has appeared in some of the earlier
Theories of Physics in modern times. -
- Our Knowledge of the true Nature
& effects of Water is wholly derived from
the discoveries of Pneumatic Chemistry
Till the year 1780 it was almost
universally beleived to be a simple body;
& in tracing the History of opinion with regard to
it before that period, We find only one

[page]2||dnp01a702pp|91027221[/page]
2
conjecture which bears any relation to the
truth: & that was formed by the
unparalled Sagacity of Newton "who
ventured to suppose from the high
refracting powers of water that it must
contain inflammable matter. -
- After the [insertion][deletion]great[/deletion] important[/insertion] properties of Hydrogene gas
had been [deletion]investigated[/deletion] [insertion]discovered[/insertion] [deletion]by M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion] Cavendish
Experiments were continually made
[insertion][deletion]in[/deletion] by Philosophers[/insertion]
upon its combustion, both for the
purpose of amusement & with the view
of detecting the cause of the Phaenomena
Various theories were invented - [underline]Scheele[/underline]
Who had performed the detonation of
Hydrogene & oxygene in open vessels only
& who found in those vessels after the process
common Air "supposed that the two
gasses had combined & that their
product was [underline]Heat -[/underline] a bold conjecture
yet stamped by the Genius of the [underline]Man[/underline]
& conformable to the [deletion][underline]observation[/underline] imperfect[/deletion]
observation which He had made;
an observation imperfect from the want
of proper apparatus. -
- [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Macquer[/insertion] as early as 1774
had observed that moisture was
formed in the combustion of inflammable

[page]3||dnp01a703pp|91027222[/page]

Air - [deletion]but D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley attempted[/deletion] [insertion]but this moisture was generally[/insertion] to
[deletion]shew that this[/deletion] beleived to be water
which had been dissolved by the
gas; & it was not till the
summer of 1781, that the fact was
properly understood. - At this
time M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish in a process
conceived with his usual sagacity
& executed with his usual precision
showed that when common Air
& Hydrogene were exploded together in
the proportion of 2 1/2 to 1 the product
was pure water" which exactly
corresponded in weight to the
Gasses consumed. - And M[superscript]r[/superscript] Watt
reasoning on this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [underline]formed the[/underline]
conclusion "that water consisted of
pure & inflammable air deprived
of the greatest portion of their latent
Heat. -
- The discovery was generally admitted;
|_ & confirmed by the [insertion]investigations[/insertion] [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] of Lavoisier
& the French Chemists it became the principle
basis of [deletion]that Antiphlogistic[/deletion] Generalisation
which has been since called the
Antiphlogistic Theory & formed the
most impressive & convincing fact of
the Doctrine. -

[page]4||dnp01a704pp|91027223[/page]
Many of the experiments on the decomposition
& composition of Water have been several
times made in this Theatre. And
I am well aware that the appearances
must be familiar to a part of
my Audience: but I may reasonably
conjecture "that Many are present
who have never witnessed them. -
In an elementary course on the
operations of [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] of the Chemistry
of the Gasses, it would be improper
to omit so important & essential
a series. - I have witnessed them very
often. I have performed them many
times & yet they seem always to
afford me some new elucidations, some
new subject for enquiry or some new object
for speculation. -
- The most simple mode of decomposing
& of forming [underline]Water[/underline] is by the agency of
[underline]electricity[/underline]; & the powerful influence under
different relations produces perfectly the
two opposite effects. -
- "When Pure water is exposed in
its [deletion]liquid[/deletion] [insertion]common[/insertion] state to the concentrated
force of electricity. passed through it

[page]5||dnp01a705pp|91027224[/page]
in the form of sparks - elastic fluid is
produced at the place of action & this
elastic fluid when examined is found to
consist [insertion]in volume[/insertion] of 1/3 of a gas which is
precisely similar to the pure part of
our Atmosphere Oxygene & of two
thirds of a Gas which is capable
of being inflamed in contact with
Air: & which is Hydrogene identical
with the gas disengaged during the
action of Sulphuric Acid upon iron
filings in the [underline]last[/underline] lecture. -
- For making the expt of the
production of oxygene & Hydrogene
from Water by means of Electricity
We may Use.
Apparatus 1
or
App[superscript]s[/superscript] 2. Woolaston. -
- Now in these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] electricity cannot
supply any ponderable matter to the
Water - Those elements of the two
gasses which are possessed of Weight
must consequently be furnished by the
Water - And as the remaining part
of the fluid is found unaltered in its
properties, a part of it must have been

[page]6||dnp01a706pp|91027225[/page]
converted into Oxygene & Hydrogene:
And in allowing that these substances
are its constituent principles; it
becomes easy to conceive that
their assumption of the elastic form
is owing to the intense Heat
communicated by the [underline]Spark[/underline]. -
- The [underline]production[/underline], of Water, by Electricity
from Oxygene & Hydrogene is still more
distinct than the phaenomena of
its decomposition
When the gasses produced from pure
water by the spark are [deletion]again[/deletion] acted
upon by it in their mingled state
they explode. Heat & light are
evolved & they resume the fluid
form. -
- The case is the same when
1 parts of oxygene [insertion]from manganese[/insertion], & 2 of hydrogene [insertion]from iron filings[/insertion] are
inflamed together
or more accurately "when the aeriform
form substances are perfectly pure"
-100 parts of oxygene & 205 of hydrogene
- In this case

[page]7||dnp01a707pp|91027226[/page]
- At the first view it appears very extraordinary
that the same influence Electricity - should
[insertion]possess the power[/insertion] both of compounding & of decompounding; & though
exhibited in the same form; yet produce
such very different effects - Our surprise
however must cease "When the difference
of its operation when elastic & nonelastic
fluid is considered. it is in this that
we must search for the solution of
the difficulty. -
Water is a very bad conductor of Heat
& [insertion] incompressible &[/insertion] when electricity passes through it in
the form of fire; there is great reason
to believe that the particles in the sphere
its action become intensely heated; whilst the
surrounding matter is [insertion]unaffected[/insertion] [deletion]uneffected[/deletion] The operation
must be instantaneous - & the high ignition
[deletion]&[/deletion] appears in cause fully adequate to explain
the production of permanent elastic fluid.
- In aeriform matter the effect must be
very different. [deletion]A[/deletion] Gases are compressible - And
the intense Heat of the spark acting as
it were in an insensible time must violently
expand the matter through which it passes; &
this [underline]expansion[/underline] taking place with surprising
velocity; will not give a mechanical
impulse to the whole of the surrounding
particles; but will act upon the immediately

[page]8||dnp01a708pp|91027227[/page]

contiguous gases as a [underline]compressing force[/underline]; And as such
[insertion]force[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] by approximately [underline]their[/underline] particles; may
be the means of their combination. -
- I develope this theory as the
one that appears most probable; it occured
to me in consequence of the late exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of M. Biot on compression - In these
experiments as I before stated, Water
was formed by the the stroke of
a condensing pump " from a due mixture
of the two gases. Here the agency
[underline]was mechanical[/underline]; & the particles being
brought nearer to each other ceased
to be mutually explosive & were brought
within the limits of elective affinity.-
- That an infinitely rapid expansion
of one part of a gas must produce
a compression of the contiguous elastic
matter is evident from the common
laws of the communication of motion.
|_ The limits of the exertion of the force
[deletion]could increase[/deletion] & the [deletion]increase[/deletion] [insertion]escalation[/insertion] of its
strength would increase together with
[underline]the velocity[/underline] - |_ the portion of time
in which electricity acts at the [insertion]greatest distance[/insertion] is too
minute to be measured; & the
[underline]compressing[/underline] power resulting from its expansive
[underline]agency on[/underline] gases may consequently be conceived
to be almost infinitely [underline]great[/underline].-

Besides these Principles [insertion]for demonstrating the nature of water[/insertion] which have been

- In all experiments upon the decomposition or composition
of [deletion]Water[/deletion] water, I have mentioned that
[deletion]the C & O[/deletion] in order to produce [underline]perfect[/underline] results
[deletion]effects[/deletion] the fluid or the gases ought
[underline]to be pure[/underline]. - They can however by
the the usual methods seldom be obtained
in a absolute state of purity -
Water even after being distilled [deletion]cold[/deletion] &
put into a close bottle whilst warm
still contains a little common Air; &
this is partly disengaged during the
action of the electrical Spark; & mixes
in minute proportions with the oxygene
& Hydrogene, evolved; but this [deletion]of[/deletion] of course
cannot be said to affect the rationale
of the process & in proportion as the
water is more free from [underline]foreign air[/underline] so
in proportion are its two constituent parts
obtained in a state [deletion]of[/deletion] approaching near to
 perfect purity; & even in common [deletion]clear[/deletion] [insertion]distilled[/insertion] water
when the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] is made over mercury the
contamination is seldom to 100 part when
the gases evolved equal the water in
Volume.

In producing gases in our artificial processes
it is scarcely ever possible to free the
vessels in which operations are performed
entirely from common Air & hence there
is usually a portion of Nitrogene
more or less minute mixed with the
oxygene and Hydrogene in exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
composition of Water. - In the case
of slow combustion however; or when
the Hydrogene is more than sufficient to
saturate the Oxygene this is of no
importance; but in processes of detonation
when there is present more Oxygene
than is sufficient to condense the
Hydrogene, a little Nitrous Acid is
formed; but this arises (as will
shewn [deletion]here[/deletion] after) from a combination
between the [deletion]oxygene/deletion] oxygene not employed
to form Water & the free Nitrogene.
- I mention[deletion]ed[/deletion] these facts because they
[deletion]have[/deletion] were formerly urged as [insertion]contradicting[/insertion] [deletion]objections[/deletion]
to the theory: [deletion]of the compo[/deletion] Whereas
when accurately considered they offer
