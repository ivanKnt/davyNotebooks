Introductory Lecture
for the Courses
[underline]of 1805[/underline]
The Love of knowledge & of intellectual
power is a faculty belonging to the
human Mind in every state of Society
and it is one by which it is most justly
[deletion]nobly[/deletion] characterised; one the most worthy
of being cultivated & extended.
-. Useful [insertion]to the individual[/insertion] & [underline]even necessary to his existence[/underline]
[deletion]of the [underline]Individual[/underline][/deletion]; its general effects upon
the species are in the highest degree
important & beneficial; & the improvements
in the condition & in the happiness of
Mankind appear in all instances to
have preserved an uniform pace with the
progress of the inventions of the Arts

- This truth scarcely requires any demon=
=stration - |_ To prove it there is no necessity
for recurring to very refined arguments ;
& the mere comparison of the rude &
of the cultivated state of Society must
carry conviction to every unprejudiced
understanding.-
- In the dreams of a brilliant
imagination indeed the [deletion]natural[/deletion] [insertion]uncivilised[/insertion] state
of Man [insertion]may appear[/insertion] in high & vivid tints of
Happiness |_ & the fancy of an enthusiast
may enable him to draw strong
contrasts between nature & art
unfavorable to the latter; Between
blue skies, verdant groves, murmuring
streams; the scenery of a mountain country;
And the smoke & dirt of Towns, the

- Many speculative men whose minds
have been awake to [deletion]all[/deletion] [underline]the [insertion]strong[/insertion] advantages[/underline]
of improvement have nevertheless
conceived that in all cases there
must be certain limits to the

that the [underline]Sciences & the Arts[/underline] however

finally tend to [deletion]produce operate[/deletion]

[deletion]produce common[/deletion][insertion]promote [underline]the increase[/underline] of[/insertion] luxury.-
Such persons [deletion]who beleive that they[/deletion]
[deletion]perceive the germs of the ruin of[/deletion]
[deletion]states in those very causes which[/deletion]
[deletion]have produced their greatness[/deletion] have
generally founded their opinions
upon incorrect views of the history

have beleived that the same [deletion]causes[/deletion] powers

the germs of the Ruin of States

[underline]those[/underline] periods , the most distinguished

that the chisel of [underline]Phidias[/underline][deletion]gave[/deletion]

dramatic [underline]poet[/underline] [insertion]Sophocles[/insertion] whose immortal
compositions [deletion]are still[/deletion] [insertion]will forever continue as[/insertion] models of
[deletion]taste[/deletion] [insertion]& excellence[/insertion] appeared as a Warrior

And that the same philosopher
who was called the wisest of
Men endured all the hardships
that the life of a common soldier
can offer.- |_And perhaps the
character of the age can be
scarcely better delineated than

in one of the incidents in which
[deletion]Socrates[/deletion] He was [underline]the great actor[/underline].
Zenophon his disciple was wounded
in the Battle of Delium Socrates

to expose his life for his friend

-. Traits of a very different character
marked the [deletion] most [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] & most[/deletion] [insertion]later periods of the[/insertion]

but had passed into the country of
the Conqueror. - [deletion]And[/deletion] At this time
Aristotle was obliged to fly from Athens
[deletion]as we are informed by Atheneus[/deletion]
& a law was passed to prevent

And [insertion]as we are informed by Atheneus[/insertion] the year before the invasion
by Philip "[underline]the freedom [/underline]of the city

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10201-000-00013|dnp02a113pp|94830746[/page]
- The same principles might be illustrated
by examples from many other Nations.-
Rome affords as many instances &
instances of precisely the same Kind as
[underline]Greece[/underline].- And [underline]at a later period[/underline]
the elevation ,[deletion]a destruction[insertion][deletion]the[/deletion][/insertion][/deletion] progress
& the decline of the power of
the Arabians [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] depended upon
similar causes.- And the only [deletion]period[/deletion] [insertion]time[/insertion]
at which this last people was
truly great [deletion]& enlightened was[/deletion]
[deletion]just[/deletion] & happy, was the [deletion]time[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]period[/deletion] time[/insertion] in
which literature & Science were
patronised by [deletion]the[/deletion] Almamon & His
successors the Calips of [underline]Bagdat.-[/underline]

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10201-000-00014|dnp02a114pp|94830748[/page]
And at the [underline]moment[/underline] that the desire
[deletion]spirit[/deletion] of intellectual [deletion]p[/deletion] improvement
[underline]disappeared[/underline]; the savage & sensual
spirit of the religion of [deletion]It[/deletion] Mahomet
carried its followers on to ruin
even amidst the triumphs of conquest;-
: & the progress of the crescent
at first marked by [insertion]victory &[/insertion] desolation soon
[deletion]& the triump & ignorance soon[/deletion]
finished [deletion]in weak[/deletion] in ignorance
& debility.-
- All [underline]experience[/underline], all analogy;
[deletion]distinct[/deletion]decidedly proves "that" unless power
& [underline]riches[/underline] are employed for
increasing the sources of mental gratification

& for keeping alive the activity of the
Soul, their tendency must be
evil - And all the [insertion]elder[/insertion] nations
who have fallen from greatness
have offered before their ruin
[deletion]a[/deletion] similar characters,- Wealth
[underline]without[/underline] [insertion]Sciences[/insertion], improving manufactures, or
commerce,- the few, the conquerors
of the [underline]many[/underline],- & great cities, peopled
only with soldiers, [insertion]with[/insertion] rich men, [insertion]with[/insertion] parasites
& slaves.-
- |_The refinements of the useful
or [deletion]or[/deletion] ornamental Arts in modern
times bear no relations to the
luxuries of the A[deletion]n[/deletion] Civilized Nations

of Antiquity; & as they are
at present pursued they are amongst
the first causes of the general
improvement of [underline]Society[/underline] - For they not
only promote individual comfort; [underline]but[/underline] they
afford [underline]constant[/underline] [deletion]of[/deletion] objects for employment;
they preserve the love of invention, they
promote emulation, & [underline]the desire[/underline] of
[underline]excellence[/underline], amongst [deletion]the[/deletion] labourers
in [underline]the same department[/underline]: & they
tend to unite the different classes
of Society by ties of usefulness,
of mutual dependence & of mutual
advantage.-

of [deletion]useful[/deletion] inventions beyond that [underline]state[/underline]
in which they are fitted for all
the [deletion]common[/deletion] [insertion]usual[/insertion] purposes of life may appear
[deletion]wholy useless & a void labours[/deletion] wholly unnecessary;-
but, it [underline]should be remembered[/underline] that
in aiming at perfection in a
manufacture, the workman is
constantly improving himself; & in
attempting to produce articles which
are to sell at a high price,
He makes a number much better
than they would otherwise be, which
are disposed of at a moderate
rate - A finely polished knife
for instance which [underline]costs a Guinea[/underline]
may not have a [deletion]finer[/deletion] better edge than
on which sells for a shilling only,

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10201-000-00018|dnp02a118pp|94830759[/page]
[deletion]in consequence of continued practise,[/deletion]
but the cutler who has produced
the expensive knife from his accurate
acquaintance with [underline]his Art[/underline] [deletion]founded[/deletion]
gained from habit & laborious operation
is able to make [underline]the common[/underline]
[underline]knife better[/underline] & at a lower rate.-
(A thousand cases of the same kind
might be adduced.- The elegant
[deletion]imitations[/deletion] [insertion]models[/insertion] of the Etruscan vases produced
by the inginuity of the late excellent
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Wedgwood may be said to
have no immediate application to
[deletion]use[/deletion] common uses ; but yet in consequence
of [underline]their[/underline] invention , a spirit of imitation
& of [deletion]improvement[/deletion] [insertion]imulation[/insertion] has operated upon
every branch of the [underline]porcelain[/underline] manufacture
& even the form & composition of our

[underline]pots[/underline] [insertion]in consequence[/insertion] have been improved.-
- In certain departments of industry
still [deletion]higher[/deletion][insertion]greater[/insertion] [underline]advantages[/underline] result from
the constant attempts to attain
the highest degree of excellence.-

[deletion]of good eating [/deletion][insertion]understands the luxur[deletion]y[/deletion]ies of the table[/insertion] will assert that
a sheep, rendered enorrmously fat
in rich pasture or on turnips,
is [underline]better[/underline] or [underline]more luxurious food[/underline]
than one that has [deletion]been fed[/deletion] grazed
on the [deletion]p[/deletion]aromatic herbage of the
Welch mountains; |_but in the

[deletion]but the cutler who has produced the[/deletion]
[deletion]expensive knife[/deletion], a number of others have
been improved to a less extent &
rendered in consequence more [deletion]fit[/deletion]
adapted to common use ; & [deletion]in consequence[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] the high price of well fed cattle has
[deletion][insertion]given a feeling of[/insertion] a spirit of emulation has been preserved[/deletion]
[deletion]amongst farmers[/deletion] has awakened the
[underline]feeling of emulation[/underline] amongst farmers.-
In consequence of which the nature
of the best breeds of cattle has
[underline]been studied[/underline]; the manner in which
they can be most efficaciously nourished
[underline]considered[/underline] :|_& from the extension of
such enquiries, all the the principles
of farming have been more minutely
investigated & the Art [deletion]on [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] of cultivati[deletion]o[/deletion]ng

- The principle is general & whenever
[underline]manufactures[/underline] or any productions of
Art become articles of general
[underline]consumption[/underline] the higher & more expensive
refinements of them are absolutely
necessary, not merely for their improvement
but likewise [underline]to[/underline] prevent their decline.
|_[underline]All[/underline] parts of the system of commerce are
intimately connected - Honorably
acquired Weath in such a [underline]country[/underline]
as that in which we have the
happiness to live , Honorably acquired
wealth I say produces credit; &
from credit arises a capital capable
of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] an extent almost indefinite.-
Hence [deletion]arises[/deletion] [insertion]proceeds[/insertion] the division of labour;-
Hence the invention of Machinery;

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10201-000-00022|dnp02a122pp|94830767[/page]
Hence the circulation of wealth & power
from one extremity of the empire
to the other, & communicating like
the vital blood flowing through the
veins to every part heath & strengh;-
Hence all the productions of the
Globe are made subservient to
the uses or the comforts of Man
& Nature arises subdued by Artificial
[insertion]means;[/insertion] not impoverished or deformed; but
enriched & rendered more beautiful.

and extension of the Sciences
will admit of no parallel instances;-
That [deletion]knowledge[/deletion] light of knowledge which
was only dimly perceived by the
ancients: which[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] was obscured by the
clouds of error & of prejudice,
has appeared [insertion]to us[/insertion] in all its purity
& brightness;- And whilst
Nature & the [deletion][unclear]laws[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]order[/insertion] established
by the Author of Nature
have been to a great extent
[underline]develloped[/underline] , the Science of
Man has not [underline]been neglected[/underline].

& exalt the feelings have [deletion]not[/deletion]

all their effect upon the mind ; |_By
means of experiment, a new creation as
it were of [deletion]truths[/deletion] [insertion]facts[/insertion] ha[deletion]ve[/deletion][insertion]s[/insertion] [deletion]been develloped[/deletion]

speculations as [underline]things[/underline] can be [underline]to words[/underline].-
Letters [underline]the great[/underline] instruments of thought, have
[deletion]generally diffused[/deletion][insertion]assisted[/insertion] Science.- And Science has given
new objects & new forms for adorning
& extending literature - All the different
branches of knowledge have assisted each
other; And [deletion]diffe[/deletion] like different instruments
of Music, the sounds of which combine
in Harmony; They have all cooperated
in enlightening the Mind, in extending
its enjoyments, & in [underline]exalting[/underline] the state

- Though [underline]so magnificent a [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/underline][deletion]Temple[/deletion]
structure has been raised in Science rapidly
& as if by a [underline]kind of enchantment[/underline] , yet it
is still unfinished & new labours &
new efforts of ingenuity [insertion]are required[/insertion] both for ornamenting
& extending it & for preventing any
of its parts from falling into decay.-
- [insertion]for[/insertion] [deletion]And[/deletion] knowledge is like a [deletion]strea[/deletion] [underline]river[/underline]
which unless its springs are constantly
[underline]supplied[/underline]; [deletion]with[/deletion] soon becomes exhausted &
ceases to flow on & to fertilize.-
- The [underline]Mind[/underline] requires novelty even as
a stimulus to exertion,:  And the Philosopher
who has made a [deletion]new[/deletion] discovery in [underline]natural[/underline]
[underline]Science[/underline]; or [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the [deletion]Artist who has produced[/deletion][insertion]Author of[/insertion]

begin here
-|_Very few Persons  in [insertion]the present day[/insertion] are disposed to
reason against the advantages resulting
from the higher refinements of Science
& [underline]Philosophy[/underline].- And the only argument
that can be [underline]brought[/underline] [deletion]against[/deletion] forward
is one founded upon the doctrine
of common utility -. |_When a new
fact [insertion]for instance[/insertion] is ascertained in Chemistry or

is very [underline]often apt[/underline] to slight it
if [underline]it[/underline] does not [underline]immediately[/underline] admit
of [underline]some application[/underline] to the common

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10201-000-00027|dnp02a127pp|94830776[/page]
14
is very unfair : for all experience proves
that the greatest & most [underline]important inventions[/underline]
Which have arisen from Scientific principles
have never been ascertained till long
after the [deletion]the[/deletion] principles themselves were
develloped; |_& so [underline]intimately connected[/underline]
are all the objects of human
enquiry; & so much dependent upon
the sensible [underline]properties of bodies[/underline]; that
it is scarely possible that any great
theoretical improvement can be made
without being soon accompanied with
practical advantages - & [deletion]new Science[/deletion]
[deletion]the discov[/deletion][insertion]new Science[/insertion][deletion]like the new ore of[/deletion][insertion]a newly discovered[/insertion]

worthy of our study for their own
sake rather than with any [deletion]view[/deletion] idea

can enlarge the [underline]views[/underline] of the mind:
raise new sentiments of intellectual

This can only be applied [underline]to the[/underline]

in Science; and in such a refined

can flourish; [deletion]to any extent[/deletion] - What is
sometimes called pedantry indeed
[underline]may depend[/underline] upon the ignorance of the
Many as compared with the knowledge
of the few.- but the moment, the language
of Science becomes the common language
of refined society every feeling of
this kind must cease.- And till that
event takes place, the person must
