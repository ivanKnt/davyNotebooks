In all [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]vegetable[/insertion] structures " [underline]the growth[/underline]"
the [underline]development of the[/underline] vital
powers, "depend," upon the
mutual [underline]action[/underline] & [underline]reaction[/underline] of
the [underline]solid[/underline] & [underline]fluid[/underline] parts.-
+ the [underline]Sap[/underline] [deletion]as[/deletion] as I mentioned
in the last lecture is the
great nutritive fluid - &
it performs "for the plant"
the same functions as the
[underline]Blood[/underline] performs for the animal
distributing to every part of
the system its active &
vivifying materials.-
- The "Sap Vessels" you saw are
almost universally distributed through
the living organs- From the Roots
through the albarnum to the
extremity of the leaves &
flowers; & from the leaves &
flowers to the minutest terminations
of the Bark.-
