the [underline]sap[/underline] always contains considerable
quantities of solid materials dissolved
in it. - & as its agencies are of
[deletion]Any [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the [insertion]greatest[/insertion] [deletion]merit[/deletion] importance
in the Oeconomy of Vegetation,
it is necessary to take a
view of its chemical constitution
as far as it has been
accurately investigated. -
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Grew attempted the analysis
of the sap in the 1660, but [insertion]as I said before[/insertion] in
his time the chemical Art
was hardly rescued from the
Alchemists; - & his failure was
not from a deficiency either
of sagacity or of ardour; but
from a want of instruments
& refined methods of research
- Bergman of Upsal in 1752
pointed out to chemists
the general properties of the sap
in forest trees; & recommended
the subject as worthy of
a minute series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
