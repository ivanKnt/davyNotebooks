In a great number of cases,
the Tanning principle is associated
with [underline]a body[/underline] resembling it
in some of its properties called
gallic acid.- This substance
abounds in "Nutgalls" whence its
name - It may be obtained from
Galls by Heating them gently, the
acid sublimes & if a proper
vessel be placed above the galls
it will adhere to the vessel
in the form of fine transparent
chrystals - [underline]Gallic acid[/underline] is soluble
[underline]in water & spirit[/underline]. It differs
from Tannin in [deletion]not[/deletion] being soluble
in oils. It does not precipitate
the Solution of Glue, but it
renders the [insertion]common[/insertion] Sol:[superscript]s[/superscript] of iron black.-
This property is likewise possessed by
[underline]Tannin[/underline]; & all good writing
inks contain the compound of
the gallic acid, Tannin, & sulphate
of Iron with excess of base diffused
through a mucilaginous fluid.
