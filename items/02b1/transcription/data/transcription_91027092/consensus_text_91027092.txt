composition, |_ It will belong more
properly to an advanced
period of the lectures - I
shall state however that there is
a very good dissertation on
this subject in the fourth
volume of [underline]Thomsons Chemistry[/underline]
the book that I quoted
in the introductory lecture
- He has described the different
vegetable substances, in detail
& without any perplexity - In
recommending his general Views
- I must however make [underline]an exception[/underline]
to one of his analytical methods
which I shall state as it is of
some importance in the enquiry
I have just been recommending
- D[superscript]r[/superscript] Thomson proposes a solution
[underline]of flint[/underline] in Potash as a test
for the presence of very small
quantities of [underline]mucilage[/underline]. - Now
this test appears to me very
inadequate & very much
inferior even to Spirit - D[superscript]r[/superscript]
