- The Art of Grafting was well known
to the ancients. It has been
[deletion]translated by[/deletion] [insertion]beautifully[/insertion] described by Virgil
in his Georgics - I shall read the
passage in M[superscript]r[/superscript] Sothebys tra
Experienced art, by varying culture knows
to graft [underline]the cion[/underline], or the but enclose. -
- |_ Where the swoln gem, in [underline]vernal vigour[/underline] bold
Bursts through the bark; and breaks each yielding fold,
slit the mid knot; and, on the wound confined
Teach the strange bud to wed the bleeding rind:
Or cut the knotless bole, and fix the spray
where mid the wood, deep wedges, force their way.
Fill[superscript]d[/superscript] with new life, erelong the tree ascends
And far and wide its branching pomp extends
Waves its aerial brow, to Heaven, aspires
And its [underline]new[/underline] leaves, and [underline]foreign fruit[/underline], admires.
