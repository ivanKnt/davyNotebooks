Lect. 3 for 1806
There are few appearances more
impressive in external nature
than the rapid growth &
expansion of Vegetable germs.
A minute & apparently
a lifeless seed in the course
of a few weeks extends
into a beautiful assemblage
of living forms; continually
becoming more perfect in
structure & in functions -
Water: the inert matter
of the soil; the elastic substances
of the Atmosphere [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] constitute
under [underline]new[/underline] arrangements
[underline]the organs of life - & undergoe[/underline]
the [underline]most remarkable alterations[/underline]
The solid becomes dissolved & fluid
This [insertion]in the sap[/insertion] pellucid liquid is rendered

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00002|dnp02b102pp|91027061[/page]
[underline]firm[/underline] & opaque; in the wood &
leaves; & the transparent &
colourless air becomes a
tinging [underline]material[/underline] a source
[deletion]of colour &[/deletion] of beauty in the
the flower. -
-'these changes' are objects
of refined study - This part
of the Chemistry of
Nature offers very curious
& important views, & very
noble investigations; - Little
is known with regard to
it - but what is known
is simple & intelligible -
|_& the [underline]present state[/underline] of the
Science evidently shews that
a new era of discovery
is advancing with regard
to the conversion of dead
into living matter.-

In all [deletion]organised[/deletion] [insertion]vegetable[/insertion] structures " [underline]the growth[/underline]"
the [underline]development of the[/underline] vital
powers, "depend," upon the
mutual [underline]action[/underline] & [underline]reaction[/underline] of
the [underline]solid[/underline] & [underline]fluid[/underline] parts.-
+ the [underline]Sap[/underline] [deletion]as[/deletion] as I mentioned
in the last lecture is the
great nutritive fluid - &
it performs "for the plant"
the same functions as the
[underline]Blood[/underline] performs for the animal
distributing to every part of
the system its active &
vivifying materials.-
- The "Sap Vessels" you saw are
almost universally distributed through
the living organs- From the Roots
through the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc] to the
extremity of the leaves &
flowers; & from the leaves &
flowers to the minutest terminations
of the Bark.-

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00004|dnp02b104pp|91027063[/page]
[underline]When in the full[/underline] vigour
of [underline]Vegetation[/underline] any of the
[underline]sap vessels are wounded[/underline] or
[underline]broken so as to open[/underline]
into [underline]the atmosphere; - a[/underline] limpid
fluid [underline]is always emitted from[/underline]
them, [underline]which may be collected[/underline]
in [underline]certain cases[/underline] in considerable
quantities.
 [deletion]In [place]place_878|America[/place] [deletion][insertion]by making a small perforation in the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc][/insertion][/deletion] a sweet[/deletion]
[deletion]sap is obtained which gives[/deletion]
[deletion]sugar on evaporation[/deletion]
The sap of the Birch
procured in this way is
employed in many parts
of [place]place_159|Britain[/place] for making
a [deletion]pe[/deletion] beverage which is used
as wine. - The [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc]
is perforated in [deletion]the ear[/deletion] spring
& a pipe is fixed in the
aperture |_ treated in this
manner a large birch tree
will yield [deletion]several[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion] gallons

of sap in the course of a few
days -
Sugar is made in [place]place_878|America[/place]
from the sap of the [underline]Maple[/underline] tree
obtained in a similar manner
Acer saccharinum / mature in 20 years / 2 to 3 feet / 40 feet - 20 to 30 gallons of sap
& whenever the [underline][misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc][/underline] in any
trees or shrubs is
perforated under proper circumstances
([insertion]that is[/insertion] when when the buds first begin
to expand & when the weather
is warm) Sap may be
constantly procured. -
This is the ascending Sap
but by the perforation of the
Bark [underline]alone[/underline] the descending
sap which has been modified
in the leaves may likewise
be obtained; but it flows
much less freely & even
in the most vigorous trees
only in very small quantities

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00006|dnp02b106pp|91027065[/page]
the [underline]sap[/underline] always contains considerable
quantities of solid materials dissolved
in it. - & as its agencies are of
[deletion]By far[/deletion] the [insertion]greatest[/insertion] [deletion]merit[/deletion] importance
in the [otherwork]otherwork_068|Oeconomy of Vegetation[/otherwork],
it is necessary to take a
view of its chemical constitution
as far as it has been
accurately investigated. -
[person]person_020|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Grew[/person] attempted the analysis
of the sap in the [deletion]17[/deletion] 1660, but [insertion]as I said before[/insertion] in
his time the chemical Art
was hardly rescued from the
Alchemists; - & his failure was
not from a deficiency either
of sagacity or of ardour; but
from a want of instruments
& refined methods of research
- [person]person_033|Bergman of Upsal[/person] in 1752
pointed out to chemists
the general properties of the sap
in forest trees; & recommended
the subject as worthy of
a minute series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00007|dnp02b107pp|91027066[/page]

but this illustrious man himself
relinquished the enquiry.
The only investigation that has
been published " on this most
curious subject since the great
improvements have been made
in the analytical Art. - is by
M. [person]person_050|Vauquelin[/person] - [otherwork]otherwork_265|An extract[/otherwork] from
his paper may be found in the
last number published of the journals
of this institution. He made
his experiments upon five different
trees - the Elm, the Hornbeam,
the Birch, the Chesnut & the
Beech. In the four first
instances the ascertained the
presence of saccharine matter
[misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc], extract & [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] matter
& in the last instance in that
of the Beech similar substances
appeared to be present with
the addition of astringent matter
& free acid matter -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00008|dnp02b108pp|91027067[/page]
You will easily conceive from
the great difference in their uses
& functions that there must be
great differences in the chemical
Nature & constitution of the
[underline]sap[/underline] in the Bark & [underline]of that[/underline] in
the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc]. I wish it was
in my power to state to you
perfect elucidations of this
interesting subject; but as yet
it has been very little an
object of enquiry - what
is known & what I have been able
to observe will at least [insertion]however[/insertion] offer
some general principles.
-. The watery part of the Sap
of the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc]
is always its most abundant
ingredient & the solid materials
dissolved in it when in their
greatest [deletion]abundance[/deletion] [insertion]quantity[/insertion] never I
beleive exceed 1/5 part. The

the sugar cane, they are nearly
in this proportion; but in
fruit & forest trees. - The [deletion]dissolved[/deletion]
soluble substances even in the most
favorable seasons [deletion]do not[/deletion] seldom exceed
1/[deletion]50[/deletion] 40 of the weight of the water. -
the Maple
The beech according to the experiments
of M. [person]person_050|Vauquelin[/person] gives [insertion]from the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc][/insertion] a sap
containing scarcely 1/42 The Elm
1/88 part & the Birch 1/189 part.
The materials dissolved
in the [insertion]ascending[/insertion] sap of different trees
differ [underline]something[/underline] in their nature
& [underline]more[/underline] in their proportions
|_ Sugar & [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc] have I beleive
been found in all cases & extractive
matter, [deletion][chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical][/deletion] & salts of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
are pretty generally [deletion]found[/deletion] present
Gluten [insertion][deletion]an astringent matter[/deletion][/insertion] likewise occurs [underline]but rarely[/underline].
|_ As in giving an account
of the Anatomical structure of

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00010|dnp02b110pp|91027069[/page]
plants it was necessary to describe
the different parts in [underline]detail[/underline];
so in the [insertion]History of the[/insertion] chemical arrange=
=ments of their elements, [deletion]it[/deletion] a
[deletion]will be essential[/deletion] description of the [deletion]differ[/deletion] various
substances in their simple
forms & as to their [underline]characteristic[/underline]
properties will be equally essential.
In the Science of [underline]analysis[/underline], the
[underline]analytical[/underline] method must never
be neglected.-
-The [underline]saccharine[/underline] [deletion]principle[/deletion] [underline]constituent[/underline] or
Sugar is [deletion]the most generally[/deletion] [insertion]is one of the best known[/insertion]
[deletion]diffused principle in the Sap[/deletion] [insertion]of chemical substances[/insertion]
[deletion]of the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc].[/deletion] - in the
sensible properties of it [deletion]this substance[/deletion]
I need make no observations
It is soluble in water & in
spirit - [underline]burns[/underline] in a strong fire
[deletion]Heat[/deletion] & is converted by
being heated strongly in distillation
into water, gazeous matter,
& [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical]. Of course It is [insertion]itself[/insertion] a compound
but in the present state of our

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00011|dnp02b111pp|91027070[/page]
"enquiry" on the immediate constituents
of the sap it would prematurely
involve long and tedious discussions
to enter into the history of
its "elementary" nature –
That it is compound a very simple
experiment will [underline]shew[/underline]
Retort. - Instance. [chemical]chemical_007|Hy[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_22|[chemical]chemical_022|oxy[superscript]e[/superscript][/chemical][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_30|Pot[superscript]h[/superscript][/chemical]. Sugar
[chemical]chemical_140|[underline]charcoal[/underline][/chemical] remains, Elastic matter
is [underline]evolved[/underline] - this phenomenon
will prepare [deletion]you[/deletion] [insertion]the mind[/insertion] for the more refined
History of its composition. In
saying this I address myself to
the uninitiated part of my audience
similar xp[superscript]ts[/superscript] have been often
exhibited in this room. This is
the most striking I am acquainted
with & it certainly is not
less demonstrative because it
is brilliant -
- [misc]misc_192|[underline]Mucilage[/underline][/misc] is the same substance
which exudes from a number
of trees in the form of [underline][chemical]chemical_340|Gum[/chemical][/underline]
It is the principal part of the
[underline]starch of grain[/underline] existing in a
coagulated state - pure [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc]

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00012|dnp02b112pp|91027071[/page]
is almost tasteless - & inodorous -
it is soluble in water & insoluble
[underline]in Spirit[/underline] - [overwritten][underline]Instance[/underline][/overwritten] [overwrite]& it[/overwrite] is detached
from water by [underline]Spirit[/underline] -
[underline]Instance[/underline] -
It burns but not so readily as
sugar; & it consists of the
[underline]same Elements[/underline] but in different
proportions - a larger quantity
of [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] & less gaseous
matter. -
[underline]Gluten[/underline] is the same in its nature
as [misc]misc_485|[underline]Birdlime[/underline][/misc]. It is the glutinous
substance which remains when
wheat is masticated. & it
may be obtained from Wheat
by washing out all the
[misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc] with warm water
It is [insertion]more[/insertion] [underline]soluble[/underline] in spirit than
in [underline]water[/underline] & water takes up
scarcely 1/00 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of its weight
Its aqueous sol[superscript]n[/superscript] is precip: by sol: oak bark
It burns with a smell like
feathers & contains much [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical]
& - [insertion]the same[/insertion] gaseous matter [deletion]different[/deletion]

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00013|dnp02b113pp|91027072[/page]
31
[deletion]as[/deletion] as the other vegetable products; but
likewise a different gaseous matter
[chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical]. -
- [underline]Extractive matter[/underline] is soluble like
Sugar is always coloured - &
when in its pure form has
[deletion]generally a[/deletion] a feeble [deletion]bitter[/deletion] subastringent 
taste. It has no effect on
solution of Glue or [chemical]chemical_176|isinglass[/chemical] [deletion]which[/deletion] as
the astringent principle has -
but it renders the Sol: of
[chemical]chemical_492|alum[/chemical] turbid.-
[underline]In Instance[/underline]
- The [underline]salts[/underline] in the Saps principally
consist of [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical], & the pure
matter of [chemical]chemical_083|Pearl ash[/chemical] united
to the [chemical]chemical_417+chemical_168|Sulphuric & acetous[line]acids[/chemical].
- In igniting the residuum of
the saps the [chemical]chemical_168|acetous acid[/chemical] is
decomposed into the same
elements as the other Vegetable
substances & in this case
the [underline]alkaline[/underline] salt remains. -
The existence of these
different substances in the same fluid

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00014|dnp02b114pp|91027073[/page]
is in consequence " of the common "
laws of chemical Attraction -
Their particles are so arranged
as not to interfere with each
other; & in their state of
solution they are admirably
fitted - to change - to
combine with, or to modify
the solid parts -
" The Sugar & the [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc]
of the Sap seem to be the
great nutritive principles
in the Vegetable Kingdom _
-: They " produce the first
expansion of the [underline]germ[/underline]; &
they are found abundantly
in the interior of the [underline]flower[/underline].
- And there is a beautiful analogy
[deletion]order[/deletion] in this respect between
Vegetable & animal life -
- The grasses which are y[superscript]e[/superscript] food
of such an enormous number
of animals, abound in saccharine

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00015|dnp02b115pp|91027074[/page]

& mucilageous fluid - Our common
edible fruits owe to them the
delicacy & sweetness of their
tastes; - so that plants the
intermediate links, between
animated & inorganic nature;-
have their[insertion] own[/insertion] wellbeing & existence
immediately dependant upon
the production of y[superscript]e[/superscript] substances which
render them a proper support
for animals.-
- In forest trees as would
appear from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of the
able Chemists just now mentioned
extractive & [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] matter
bear a much greater proportion
to the whole of the solid
contents of the saps than in
shrubs & the [deletion]succulent[/deletion] succulent
Vegetables; but even in these
cases [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc] & sugar still
predominate; |_ In the elaboration
of the fluid from ye soil
they are develloped as the

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00016|dnp02b116pp|91027075[/page]
most essential products; & the most
active sources of growth & assimilation
- No [insertion]chemical[/insertion] experiments have as yet
been published upon the descending
sap the sap of the Bark.-
- |_ But much indirect information
may be gained upon the
subject from the researches
that have been made upon
the soluble ingredients in
the bark itself - The
[underline]Tanning properties[/underline] of Barks,
their being absolutely necessary
to the important & expensive
manufacture of leather have
rendered them objects of
much attention & various
minute enquiries have been
made upon the[deletion]ir[/deletion] chemical
constitution of different
species -
When a piece of [underline]Bark[/underline] is stripped

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00017|dnp02b117pp|91027076[/page]
33
from an oak or chesnut or other
forest tree at the time the
Sap is in vigorous motion; &
immediately cut into pieces &
infused in warm water, it
will afford [underline]soluble principles[/underline].
[deletion]of which the greatest portion[/deletion]
[deletion]existed dissolved in the Sap.-[/deletion]
- To make this exp[superscript]t [/superscript]in an
unexceptionable way, the Epidermis
& y[superscript]e[/superscript] old [deletion]bark[/deletion] & dead cortical layers
ought to be first removed &
only the interior of y[superscript]e[/superscript] living
part submitted to the action
of the Water - In this the
Vessels are full of [underline]juices[/underline] &
the sap which was descending
mixes with the fluid.-
- The Sap of the Bark
(it would appear from all the
experiments that have been made)
contains considerably more solid
matter dissolved in it than the

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00018|dnp02b118pp|91027077[/page]
sap of the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc]. The
Interior layer of the Bark of
the young oak affords nearly
1/8 of its weight of soluble
matter; - the same substance
in the Spanish chesnut 1/10
& in the Leicester willow 1/7 . -
& that this material principally
exists in the fluid form is
evident from the circumstance
that similar Barks cut when
the sap is not circulating
in Winter - give [deletion]four[/deletion] a [deletion]or[/deletion] quantity
[deletion]five times[/deletion] four or five times less.-
|_ It is very easy to conceive why
so much more solid matter [deletion][insertion]the same ingredients exist[/insertion][/deletion]
exists in the sap of the Bark
than in the sap of the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc],
an immense quantity of water
is dissipated by Evaporation
from "the leaves" - infinitely

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00019|dnp02b119pp|91027078[/page]
34
less fluid descends - & the Sap
after being modified by the
action of Heat, light & Air
if less abundant in quantity
is [underline]more saturated[/underline] with active
ingredients. -
- The [deletion]descending sap[/deletion] [insertion]fluid obtained in this way[/insertion] differs
exceedingly in [deletion]all[/deletion] its sensible
properties from the ascending sap -
- The ascending sap [insertion]as I mentioned[/insertion] in by far the
greater number of instances [deletion]&[/deletion] has
a feeble sweet or sub acid taste,
[deletion]but if the [/deletion] The sap in the [underline]bark[/underline] is generally
astringent or acrid & sometimes
strongly bitter - . [deletion]This effect h[/deletion]
[deletion]may be perceived by some[/deletion]
[deletion]the Oak[/deletion] If the vessels in the
Bark of the [deletion]Oak[/deletion] [insertion]Beech[/insertion] be [underline]wounded[/underline]
(for instance) / the fluid which ouses
out is coloured brown & has
a stiptic taste... - The bark of
the plum treated in the same
way gives an acrid fluid &
the bark of the willow a bitter one.

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00020|dnp02b120pp|91027079[/page]
- The [underline]astringent principle[/underline] is found
in larger or smaller quantities
in almost all the barks that
have been [underline]examined[/underline].- It is called
by chemists [misc]misc_198|[underline]Tannin[/underline][/misc]. & in its
pure state is a [underline]solid easily[/underline]
[underline]fusible[/underline] & [underline]combustible[/underline].- It dissolves
both in [underline]water & in spirit[/underline] &
has the characteristic property
of precipitating a solution of
[underline]Glue or [chemical]chemical_176|isinglass[/chemical][/underline] - [underline]Instance[/underline] -
It is [insertion]this[/insertion] property on which its tanning
[underline]agency depends[/underline] - Glue is merely
[underline]skin[/underline] broken down & dissolved
by [underline]boiling water[/underline]:- & when Solid
[underline]skin[/underline] is infused in a solution
of [misc]misc_198|[underline]Tannin[/underline][/misc] it retains its organized
form & [underline]texture[/underline] unites to the
[misc]misc_198|Tannin[/misc], renders the water tasteless
increases in weight & if the
process is slowly and properly conducted
becomes good leather - leather
[deletion]capable of[/deletion] impermeable to water
fit for making de[superscript]r[/superscript] shoes.
On the causes which have operated on the progress

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00021|dnp02b121pp|91027080[/page]
35
In a great number of cases,
the Tanning principle is associated
with [underline]a body[/underline] resembling it
in some of its properties called
[chemical]chemical_079|gallic acid[/chemical].- This substance
abounds in [misc]misc_282|"Nutgalls"[/misc] whence its
name - It may be obtained from
Galls by Heating them gently, the
acid sublimes & if a proper
vessel be placed above the galls
it will adhere to the vessel
in the form of fine transparent
chrystals - [chemical]chemical_079|[underline]Gallic acid[/underline][/chemical] is soluble
[underline]in water & spirit[/underline]. It differs
from [misc]misc_198|Tannin[/misc] in [deletion]not[/deletion] being soluble
in oils. It does not precipitate
the Solution of Glue, but it
renders the [insertion]common[/insertion] Sol:[superscript]s[/superscript] of iron black.-
This property is likewise possessed by
[misc]misc_198|[underline]Tannin[/underline][/misc]; & all good writing
inks contain the compound of
the [chemical]chemical_079|gallic acid[/chemical], [misc]misc_198|Tannin[/misc], & [chemical]chemical_352|sulphate[line]of iron[/chemical] with excess of base diffused
through a [misc]misc_192|mucilaginous[/misc] fluid.

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00022|dnp02b122pp|91027081[/page]
- The bitter principle is known
by its taste. it is extremely
soluble; [deletion]in[/deletion] & affects none of
the substances by which the
other vegetable materials of
the sap are altered. - Its
sensible properties are more
obvious than its chemical
properties. [deletion]It seems to be[/deletion]
[deletion]susceptible of many modifications[/deletion]
Of all vegetable principles it
has the least tendency to
decomposition & it prevents
other vegetable principles from
undergoing change. - It is the
bitter principle of the Hop
which preserves our Beer; [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]or at least[/insertion]
[insertion]it ought to be[/insertion] in [misc]misc_199|Peruvian Bark[/misc], in [misc]misc_488|Gentian[/misc],
[insertion]in [deletion][misc]misc_488|Gentian[/misc][/deletion][/insertion] it is the [deletion]principle[/deletion] [insertion]material[/insertion] on
which [deletion]their[/deletion] the antiseptic properties
[insertion]of these substances[/insertion] & probably their febrifuge powers
depend.-

-"Besides these principles which as it were
characterise the sap in its
descent & which exist either
together or singly in almost
every instance [insertion]in trees[/insertion] - |_ Extractive
Matter - [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc] sugar
& [underline]different [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical][/underline] matters
[underline]likewise occur[/underline] . Extractive matter
is often combined with [misc]misc_198|Tannin[/misc]
as in the [insertion]barks of ye[/insertion] Oak, the Chesnut, the Alder
[misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc] often occurs with
this substance . [deletion]& sugar[/deletion] as in the
bark of the Elm.- & Sugar
sometimes, as in the different
species of the Willow - In
the bark of the common Willow
I found both the bitter principle
& the saccharine principle.-
[deletion]Though the astringent matters[/deletion]

The sap of the [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc]
& the Sap of bark [insertion][deletion]then[/deletion][/insertion] contain, then

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00024|dnp02b124pp|91027083[/page]
certain common principles which
might reasonably expected when
it is considered that the
latter is derived from the former;
And to pursue an idea started just now
- They may be said to bear
an analogy to each other
similar to [insertion]that existing between[/insertion] the Venous &
arterial blood in the animal
system - & as the Venous
blood gains its highly
stimulating & active powers by
[deletion]in passing through the[/deletion] [deletion]as being exposed[/deletion] [insertion]exposure[/insertion] to air
in passing through the lungs.
So the Sap seems to be
elaborated & rendered more
[deletion]energetic[/deletion] [insertion]active[/insertion] & nutritive during
its exposure to the Atmosphere
in the leaves. -
- In the trees & shrubs
[deletion]of the[/deletion] indigenous in this Country
there are comparatively few
instances [insertion]on record[/insertion] of the ascending sap

"containing" the same astringent
materials as the bark" but
in the trees of the Hot climates
this often happens - the ascending
saps of various species of the
[misc]misc_489|Mimosa[/misc] [deletion]is astrin[/deletion] particularly that
kind whence the [chemical]chemical_470|Gum Arabic[/chemical]
is procured is astringent - &
the wood of this tree is boiled
in [place]place_531|India[/place] for the purpose of
affording the [chemical]chemical_277|"Catechu"[/chemical] which
contains 1/2 its weight of the

- I made a perforation in the

which might have depended
upon the presence of a small
quantity of extractive matter.
- To examine the sap of
the Bark I laid bare the interior
cortical layers in the uper part
of the tree & introduced a
[deletion]small[/deletion] similar tube - a pale
yellow fluid slowly oused forth

- Much depends [deletion]upon[/deletion] in such

[deletion][insertion]by the lateral vess[/insertion][/deletion] by means of the perforated

a mixture [underline]between the fluids[/underline]

[deletion]A number of[/deletion] Numerous researches [insertion]are wanting[/insertion] in this most

be very easily made. - |_ [underline]A serie[/underline]s
of experiments upon the saps of different
trees at different times in its

in its progress through the Bark
could not fail of throwing the
most important light on the
Physiology of Vegetation -

The smallest portions [deletion]might[/deletion]

- By making a little perforation in

a [underline]penknife[/underline];- by introducing a

- The general quantity even of

none of the vegetable products are
more than 1 1/2 as heavy as

what were the relations

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00030|dnp02b130pp|91027089[/page]
matter left by two different
kinds of Sap.-
Such Experiments Experiments so
humble in their means would
be of the highest importance
in their applications - If
(for instance) it should be
found that during the
opening of the buds - the
ascending sap below a bud
contained much more [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc]
& saccharine principle than the
sap above it - & that the
descending sap above it contained
more astringent & extractive matter
than the descending sap below.-
It would be a fair inference
that "the principles" which had
disappeared had combined to
form the new matter of the
stalk & leaves: & such
a [underline]conclusion[/underline] would be
a beautiful [underline]general principle[/underline]
- A [underline]great[/underline] variety of similar
objects might be pointed
out in this [deletion]beautiful[/deletion] [insertion]delightful[/insertion] &

almost untouched field of [deletion]research[/deletion] -
Investigation - |_ And it must be
an additional seduction to the
pursuit - "That no labour is
required, but merely refined
observation - [deletion]The[/deletion] That the
[underline]laboratory[/underline] would be the [deletion]grove[/deletion]

- I have not given a [underline]minute[/underline]
account of the [underline]chemical[/underline] History
of the [deletion]of[/deletion] different substances
found in the sap - |_ I conceive
it would be premature at
this period of the enquiry - |_ To
go over the list of their
attractions & agencies would

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00032|dnp02b132pp|91027091[/page]
tend to obscure the subject & would
provokingly carry away the attention
from the phaenomena of Vegetation -
There are numerous modifications
of the different [underline]vegetable[/underline]
[underline]substances[/underline] known to chemists -
& they are all exceedingly liable
[underline]to change[/underline] to pass into
each other - |_ & hence it
is very difficult to give
a clear & distinct account
of them - |_ Organized compounds
like [misc]misc_057|the Proteus[/misc] of Antiquity
or the [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc] of Arabian Romance;
are continually exhibiting new
powers & appearing under new
forms & when they are [deletion]as[/deletion]
[deletion]it[/deletion] confined & as it were chained
in one shape - they often
escape in another; & from
solids pass rapidly into fluids
& from fluids into gasses -
- This is my apology for

composition, |_ It will belong more
properly to an advanced
period of the lectures - I
shall state however that there is
a very good dissertation on
this subject in the fourth
volume of [otherwork]otherwork_058|[underline]Thomsons Chemistry[/underline][/otherwork]
the book that I quoted
in the introductory lecture
- He has described the different
vegetable substances, in detail
& without any perplexity - In
recommending his general Views
- I must however make [underline]an exception[/underline]
to one of his analytical methods
which I shall state as it is of
some importance in the enquiry
I have just been recommending
- [person]person_226|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Thomson[/person] proposes a solution
[underline]of [chemical]chemical_106|Flint[/chemical][/underline] in [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] as a test
for the presence of very small
quantities of [misc]misc_192|[underline]Mucilage[/underline][/misc]. - Now
this test appears to me very
inadequate & very much
inferior even to Spirit - D[superscript]r[/superscript]

[page]34|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00034|dnp02b134pp|91027093[/page]
[person]person_226|Thomson[/person] justly states that it is
rendered turbid [underline]by[/underline] [misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc]; but
it is likewise precipitated by
all acids & by a number
of [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] substances & these
bodies are constantly found
in [underline]Vegetables[/underline] - Such a practice
might lead to the most
erroneous conclusions - &
I [deletion]feel[/deletion] am convinced that the
enlightened Historian of our
Science will feel obliged
to me for pointing out the
circumstance - |_ It would almost
exceed the [underline]limits of[/underline] possibility
that there should be no
mistakes in so great &
extensive a work; it is
astonishing that they are
so rare, it reflects the
highest credit on the patience
accuracy & judgement of the
Author.-
[deletion]I [underline]shall include[/underline][/deletion]

[page]35|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00035|dnp02b135pp|91027094[/page]
- |_ The relation " of [underline]engrafting[/underline] [deletion]by[/deletion]
[deletion]inoculation[/deletion] to the [underline]subject[/underline]
of the chemical composition of
the Sap is very obvious & well
worthy of attention |_ With
this enquiry I shall conclude
for the time is too much
advanced to admit of the
discussion of the causes of the
motion of the [underline]sap[/underline] - it involves
much argumentative & some
experimental matter - I shall
reserve it as a part of the
next lecture.-
|_ When the branch of a tree
of a tree in full vigour, is
cut off; & placed in the
ground in such a way that
some of its incipient buds
or germens are covered by
moist soil - it almost
always throws out [misc]misc_483|radicles[/misc]
which become roots; & if the

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00036|dnp02b136pp|91027095[/page]
proper season is [deletion]chosen[/deletion] selected;-
this mode of multiplying trees as
by cutting [insertion][underline]is well[/underline] known[/insertion] is very effectual -
- But instead of being planted
in the ground the - [underline]branch[/underline]
may be transferred to another
tree; - [underline]from which[/underline] a [underline]similar[/underline]
[underline]branch has been removed[/underline];-
& by adapting [underline]the incisions[/underline];
& defending [deletion]them[/deletion] from the
[underline]action of the air[/underline], by a
cement of clay or other
adhesive substance; an union
will take place |_ & if the
proper circumstances are observed
the branch will grow vigorously
in its new situation; will
become as it were parasitical
& [deletion]free[/deletion] be supported by the
sap of [underline]the stock[/underline] on which
it [underline]is fixed.[/underline]
[underline]Graft[/underline] examined found
to communicate by the common
tubes.

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00037|dnp02b137pp|91027096[/page]

- In the adherence of the graft
to the tree, there is merely an
inosculation of the fibres of the new
[deletion]tree[/deletion] [misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc] & barks |_ & the
communication of the Sap is
through the common tubes & the porous
tubes, which being so generally
diffused, must necessarily correspond
in many parts.-
[person]person_240|Dr Darwin[/person] supposes in the [otherwork]otherwork_90|Phytologia[/otherwork]
that the engrafted bud sends down
its own fibrils [deletion]from the[/deletion] as [misc]misc_483|radicles[/misc]
to the soil; but [person]person_024|Mr Knight[/person] has
shewn that this cannot happen.
& the line between the old wood
& the engrafted wood is always
marked & the new wood of the
[insertion][deletion]their substances[/deletion][/insertion]
graft never spreads [insertion][underline]downwards[/underline][/insertion] [deletion]more than a few[/deletion]
[deletion]times[/deletion] beyond the point of original junction

- The Art of Grafting was well known
to the ancients. It has been
[deletion]translated by[/deletion] [insertion]beautifully[/insertion] described by Virgil
in his [otherwork]otherwork_136|Georgics[/otherwork] - I shall read the
passage in [otherwork]otherwork_136|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Sothebys tra[/otherwork]
Experienced art, by varying culture knows
to graft [underline]the cion[/underline], or the but enclose. -
- |_ Where the swoln gem, in [underline]vernal vigour[/underline] bold
Bursts through the bark; and breaks each yielding fold,
slit the mid knot; and, on the wound confined
Teach the strange bud to wed the bleeding rind:
Or cut the knotless bole, and fix the spray
where mid the wood, deep wedges, force thier way.
Fill[superscript]d[/superscript] with new life, erelong the tree ascends
And far and wide its branching pomp extends
Waves its aerial brow, to Heaven, aspires
And its [underline]new[/underline] leaves, and [underline]foreign fruit[/underline], admires.

[deletion]The[/deletion]- Ingrafting can be only successfully
performed upon trees the ascending
& descending sap of which are
[insertion]respectively[/insertion] similar - |_ [person]person_022|Du Hamel[/person] found
that [insertion]branches of[/insertion] the pear, the Apple
[deletion]&[/deletion] the plum, & the Peach
speedily died when attached
to the oak, the elm & other
forest trees;- both the
juices of the bark & the
[misc]misc_484|Alburnum[/misc] are different &
their habits with regard
to germination & blossoming
altogether unlike.-
- In gardening, in general this
operation is only performed
upon varieties of the same species;
but it will succeed even with
different species in the same
natural family.- Thus the
peach may be successfully
engrafted upon the plum. - Their
[underline]juices are alike[/underline] & they part

[page]42|MS-DAVY-10221-000-00042|dnp02b142pp|91027101[/page]
forth their blossoms under similar
circumstances nearly in the same
time
46
- The graft is [underline]only nourished[/underline], by
the sap of the tree to which
it is transferred, its properties
are not changed by it;
the [deletion]fruit is of the same[/deletion] leaves, blossoms & fruits
are of the same kind as
if it had vegetated upon
its parent stock - |_ The only
advantage [deletion]is[/deletion] to be gained in
this way, is the affording
to a graft from an old
tree a more plentiful &
healthy food than it could
have procured in its natural
state, it is rendered for
a time more vigorous; & produces
fairer blossoms & richer fruits.
[deletion]This process was know to the Romans[/deletion]
[deletion]& beautifully expressed by Virgil in his[/deletion]

Many ridiculous ideas [insertion]formerly[/insertion] prevailed
amongst [deletion]the old[/deletion] Gardeners on
the subject [insertion]of change by ingrafting[/insertion] It [deletion]has also[/deletion] been
supposed that mixed
fruits would be procured
in this way |_ & though [person]person_124|[underline]Lord[/underline][line][underline]Bacon[/underline][/person] with that strength

peculiarly belonged to him
denied the possibility of
such a circumstance; yet
the idea has been [insertion]lately[/insertion] revived
Thus in the first volume
of the Com[superscript]s[/superscript] to the B.A. Mr
[person]person_937|Jay[/person] "states that there is an
apple [deletion]in an[/deletion] existing at New York
sweet on one side & sour on

two [underline]slit scions[/underline] one from a

the other from a tree [deletion]producing[/deletion] [insertion]yielding[/insertion]

in Brandy ascribed to their
having been produced from
a graft in a laurel tree.
Such alterations are
impossible / "the stock giveth
aliment but no notion to
[underline]the graft"[/underline] - |_& the Graft
partakes not merely of the obvious
properties; but likewise
of the infirmities, &
[underline]dispositions to old[/underline] age
[underline]& decay[/underline]; of the tree
whence it sprang, -
- This seems to be
distinctly shown by the
observations & experiments
of [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] -
[person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] has in a
