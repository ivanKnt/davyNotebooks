- In the Heat of summer
[deletion]as[/deletion] the ground becomes dry
& parched, the roots no
longer find fluid to carry
[underline]upwards[/underline]. |_ & except in
[underline]rainy or moist[/underline] days
[underline]there is little or no[/underline] ascent
through the Vessels -
- [underline]In autumn[/underline] as long as
the weather is warm & the
[underline]soil moist[/underline] both evaporation
& absorption take place.
[deletion]&[/deletion] the death & decay of
the leaf alone
finishes the process. - And
in Evergreens, there is always
in the [deletion]warm[/deletion] mild days
of the winter - a certain
impulse of fluid from
the Roots towards the
leaves
