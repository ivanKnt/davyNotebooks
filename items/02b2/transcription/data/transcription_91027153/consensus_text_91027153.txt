Change is the diet on which
all subsist - created changeable
And Change at last destroys
them.
Skies uncertain, [underline]now[/underline] the
Heat transmitting cloudless,
& the Solar beam [underline]now[/underline]
quenching in a boundless
sea of clouds, - Calm
& alternate storm, Moisture
& Drought invigorate by
turns the springs, of
life, in all that [underline]live[/underline]. -
