to the strippers of oak bark by the

considered the cambium as essential
to the formation of the new parts

"The cambium appears
when the buds first begin to expand,
It is in greatest abundance early
in the season; as the summer advances
is quantity diminishes; - and when
the new parts are completely formed

it disappears altogether. -

Volatile oils are miscible
in a slight degree

& this [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]must be principally[/insertion] owing to the absorption
of oxygene during the Baking:

to have given [underline]rise[/underline] to the

|_ [underline]It is not[/underline] difficult to
conceive after these illustrations
how the different [underline]peculiar[/underline]

 & [underline]secretion[/underline] [insertion][underline]as it has been[/underline] called[/insertion] in the vegetable
Kingdom seems to be merely
the results of new arrangements
in the [underline]fluid elements[/underline] of
[underline]the vessels[/underline] - by which one
principle is repelled & another
attracted, according to the powers
of [underline]combination[/underline] of the different
[deletion]organs[/deletion] parts.-
- [underline]The Motion[/underline], of the Sap the
prime cause of these phaenomena
& the [underline]the other phaenomena[/underline] of
Vegetation has been much an
object of enquiry; both in ancient
& in modern times & the
true solution of the problem
is of considerable importance.-.-
-: [person]person_020|[underline]Grew[/underline][/person] impressed by the effects
of the warmth of the [underline]spring[/underline]
on Vegetation & on the phaenomena
of Vegetable transpiration conceived
" that the sap rose in a form
in the

[page]34|MS-DAVY-10222-000-00034|dnp02b234pp|91027141[/page]
analogous to Vapour, " sufficiently
subtile to [underline]penetrate the[/underline] minutest
tubes, & [underline]sufficiently light[/underline]
to ascend to [deletion]ascend to[/deletion]
& be to emitted by the leaves-
-: Soon after when the Genius
of Newton had turned the
whole attention of the
philosophical world to
the mechanical Laws
of Matter - Capillary
Attraction was assumed
as the great cause of
the ascent of [underline]the sap[/underline]
|_ [underline]That species[/underline] of attraction
by which water rises
through [deletion]fibres[/deletion] small fibres
or through paper or by
which it becomes elevated
above the common level
in small glass tubes.
|_ This notion at first exceedingly
specious; was soon overturned
by the elegant exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of

D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales.
- This acute philosopher
fastened tubes to different
branches of Vines & other
trees - | & He found
that the sap rose in
the tubes far above the
level of the sap Vessels-
& that the force of the
ascending sap [insertion]in vigorous vegetation[/insertion] was more
than sufficient to [deletion]overcome[/deletion]
raise a weight [deletion]great[/deletion] superior
to that of the whole atmosphere -
[deletion]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales cemented a glass tube[/deletion]
[deletion]to the lowest section of[/deletion]
[deletion]branch of a [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] This
figure represents [insertion]one of this[/insertion] His apparatus -

-30 Barometer.-

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10222-000-00036|dnp02b236pp|91027143[/page]
Now capillary action can only
be exerted below the level of
the tubes. - It can not raise
[underline]fluids[/underline] above their level
|_ & [underline]their exhibition[/underline] of the power
[deletion]of[/deletion] acting upon the ascending
Sap, at once decides the
[underline]question[/underline] - that the mechanical
power of attraction can [deletion]neither[/deletion] [insertion]neither[/insertion]
be the only cause nor even
[deletion]certainly not[/deletion], the cheif cause.-
[underline]M de Saussure[/underline] unable to
find any [underline]physical solution[/underline]
[underline]of the enquiry[/underline]. referred the
ascent of [underline]the sap[/underline] to
a peculiar living & irritable
power " in the " vessels; by
which [insertion]He conceived[/insertion] they alternately
contracted & expanded, like
the Heart & Arteries of Animals.-
Analogy undoubtedly is in
[underline]favor of this [insertion]ingenious[/insertion] idea[/underline]; but it

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10222-000-00037|dnp02b237pp|91027144[/page]

is merely [underline]Hypothetical[/underline] : the
[underline]exertion[/underline] of no such power
has as yet been [underline]perceived[/underline].
& the assumption of it is
rather [underline]cutting[/underline] than untying
the [misc]misc_453|Knot.[/misc] -
[person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] as I mentioned
before considers the change
produced in the volume
of the silver fibres of
the Wood from changes
of temperature as a prime
mover of the Sap - The
opinion is supported by
facts; the Authority in
high & there is no
recondite principle required
for the support of the [underline]notion[/underline].
[person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] found that
small apertures in the
alburnum in the direction of
the silver fibres were of very different

[deletion]the fo[/deletion] When the sun was
[underline]bright[/underline] & the Atmosphere warm
there was a great expansion
towards evening a contraction;
& [underline]at night[/underline], the sides
approached each other -
- Such a cause must
be efficient; but there
must be likewise many
other causes- [deletion]We are[/deletion]
[deletion]perhaps sometimes too fond[/deletion]
[deletion]of finding [insertion][deletion]endeavouring to assume a great[/deletion][/insertion] one great[/deletion]

There can be no doubt but
the [underline]fibrils[/underline] of the [underline]Roots[/underline] [deletion]hav[/deletion]
are possessed of [underline]capillary attraction[/underline]
they will take up fluids which
are even poisonous to them in
consequence of [underline]this power[/underline]; &
they possess it in their dead
as well as in their living
[underline]states[/underline]; [deletion]but though[/deletion] capillary
[underline]attraction[/underline] [insertion]then[/insertion] may [insertion][deletion]then[/deletion][/insertion] introduce the
fluid of the [underline]sap[/underline], though
it cannot be the sole cause
of its ascent -
- We Know from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of [underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales[/underline] that an immense
quantity of [underline]Water[/underline] is given

carried off from the Vessels
& a [underline]vacuum[/underline] in them would
be the consequence ; unless its
place was [underline]supplied[/underline] [deletion]by[/deletion]
from the general system -
|_ This [underline]powerful cause[/underline] must
be a prime agent in
determining the motion
of the sap from the
Roots towards the leaves.-
-:. The Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Montgolfier
the celebrated Inventor of
the Ballon have [underline]shewn[/underline]
that [underline]Water[/underline] may be raised
almost to [deletion]an[/deletion] indefinite
height by a very small
force., provided its presure,
is taken off by continued
divisions of the column of
fluid.-

the vessels of plants |_ Which
are [underline]far from[/underline] being rectilinear
tubes & which are associated
with such a variety of

- [deletion]Their[/deletion] new & curious hydraulic
principle of [insertion]Montgolfier[/insertion]
[deletion]is every[/deletion] may operate with respect
to the [deletion]elevation of[/deletion] [insertion]continued ascent of[/insertion] the fluid
[deletion]sap[/deletion] & may combine with
the other causes in producing
the full effect;- with
the capillary attraction of
the roots, with the contraction
of the silver grain & with
the [deletion]perhaps[/deletion] [underline]evaporation from[/underline]
[underline]the leaves perhaps the most[/underline]
[underline]powerful of all in its effects.[/underline]
In the infancy of
the buds the Sap rises only

[page]42|MS-DAVY-10222-000-00042|dnp02b242pp|91027149[/page]
[underline]very feebly[/underline] & the evolution
of [underline]the leaf[/underline] is [underline]owing[/underline] [deletion]to[/deletion]
in [underline]perennial[/underline] trees, to concrete
sap which has existed through
[underline]the winter[/underline]. - [underline]& which[/underline] has
as it were been hoarded
up to supply the first
wants of the [deletion]tree[/deletion]
newly formed infant
organs -
- When the leaves are
fully develloped the force
of the ascending sap
becomes [underline]amazingly increased[/underline]
It rises most in the
Hot parts [underline]of the day[/underline]
[underline]when the evaporation[/underline]
is great /_ & it is quiescent
[underline]or it falls towards[/underline]
[underline]night when transparation[/underline]
[underline]is no longer performed.[/underline]

[page]43|MS-DAVY-10222-000-00043|dnp02b243pp|91027150[/page]
- In the Heat of summer
[deletion]as[/deletion] the ground becomes dry
& parched, the roots no
longer find fluid to carry
[underline]upwards[/underline]. |_ & except in
[underline]rainy or moist[/underline] days
[underline]there is little or no[/underline] ascent
through the Vessels -
- [underline]In autumn[/underline] as long as
the weather is warm & the
[underline]soil moist[/underline] both evaporation
& absorption take place.
[deletion]&[/deletion] the death & decay of
the leaf alone
finishes the process. - And
in Evergreens, there is always
in the [deletion]warm[/deletion] mild days
of the winter - a certain
impulse of fluid from
the Roots towards the
leaves

- I shall continue this subject
& consider some objections that
may be made to the
theory [insertion]& some further illustrations of it[/insertion] in the next [underline]lecture[/underline]
when [deletion]I sh[/deletion] the different
systems of sap vessels [insertion]of annual & perennial[/insertion] trees

I cannot however conclude
without endevouring to fix
your attention - upon the
singular beauty in the
[underline]connection of[/underline] the Oeconomy
of [underline]the motion[/underline] of the

In this instance as
