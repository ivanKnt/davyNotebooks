and sciences: for Nature cannot otherwise
be commanded, than by obeying her laws.
If any one, , in the last place, should object,

and turned to evil purposes [deletion]as[/deletion] sin, luxury,

Courage, Strength, Beauty, Riches, [insertion]& even[/insertion] light it-

Right over Nature, which was given
them by [insertion]the[/insertion] divine Being; |_ let them be well
[underline]provided of materials;[/underline] and rectified Re=
