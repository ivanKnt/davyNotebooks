Course 1807. 1 - written Jan[superscript]y[/superscript]. 30 in one [insertion]day .. to be delivered 31.-[/insertion]
Dependent upon the forms and the beings
of [underline]External Nature[/underline], for the gratifications of
our wants, and for many of our Comforts,
and enjoyments we habitually acquire from
individual experience, a [underline]certain[/underline] [underline]degree[/underline] of [underline]inf=[/underline]
[underline]=ormation[/underline] concerning their [underline]operations[/underline] and their
[underline]Changes[/underline]. ~~~
This information however is extremely im=
=perfect - The most acute and penetrating gen=
=ius unassisted by [underline]Scientific methods[/underline] wholly
fails in its attempts to trace [underline]effects[/underline] to
their Causes. - And an aquaintance with
the minute relations and properties of natural
Objects, and the laws by which they are go=
=[underline]verned Can[/underline] be [underline]Obtained by[/underline] philosophical stu=
=[underline]dy only[/underline]; by an enquiry into natural science,
into that System of extensive knowledge which
has been accumulated in different times

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10241-000-00002|dnp02c102pp|97185053[/page]
and Collected from a variety of Sources - by
multiplied observations, labour and engenu=
=ity. _
Natural Science is founded on minute
critical views of the general order of events
taking place upon our globe, corrected
enlarged, or exalted by experiments, in whi=
=ch the agents concerned are placed under
new circumstances; and their deversified
properties separately examined. - The [underline]body[/underline]
of [underline]Natural Science[/underline], then consists of facts -
Its governing Spirit is [underline]analogy[/underline] - The relation
or resemblance of facts. by which its different
parts are connected, arranged, and employ=
=ed either for [underline]popular use[/underline] or for new spec=
=ulative improvements. -
The [underline]Chemical Phoenomena[/underline] of Nature Con=
=stitutes the objects of one of the most exten=
=sive branches of [underline]this Science[/underline]. -
The parts of all known bodies are Cap=

=able of new arrangements. - And all the
changes in their constitution, whether rapid
or [underline]slow[/underline] whether the work of hours or of days
or of ages, whether grand, or minute, are
equally the subjects of chemistry. -
The study embraces a great number of
[underline]principles[/underline] and [underline]facts[/underline] various in their
nature, importance, and applications. -
|_A general view of the order and plan
of the course will be [insertion]perhaps not as considered as are[/insertion] improper introductory
[underline]illustrations[/underline].-
|_ This view from the multitude of objects
which must be crowded together, will I fear
be very tedious - but it is necessary. |_ And
If you will have the goodness to attend
to it [insertion]It may remove some difficulties and [/insertion] It may prevent disappointments. -
For it will explain - |_ How much of
common and familiar philosophical
detail will be introduced, the general

will be offered -

_:-" The order of Nature is immediately
dependent upon the continual

[underline]would be[/underline] [deletion]an[/deletion] unintelligible

first amongst the subjects of
speculation that press themselves
upon the inquisitive Mind &

to occupy [underline]our[/underline] consideration. -
[insertion]How much[/insertion] |_ The Researches of modern Chemistry
the methods of the Experimental
Art - have demonstrated that
all natural bodies consist
of different [underline]arrangements[/underline]
or [underline]combinations[/underline] of a few

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10241-000-00006|dnp02c106pp|97185057[/page]
simple facts; or elements. |_ And
it is [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]on[/insertion] the knowledge of
the unvariable properties &
agencies with which these
Elements are endowed that
the whole of the demonstrative
part of the science depends
|_ Amidst their numerous alterations
the Chemist is generally
capable of arresting them
and of examining them in their
base forms - & in their
different states of existence
whether as Solids, as Fluids
or as aeriform substances
they are almost equally
within his power - equally
capable of being investigated
by experimental means -
On this subject I shall
enter [insertion]only[/insertion] generally [deletion]only[/deletion]; illustrating

Events [deletion]will afford[/deletion] even will afford
a number of instances

examined [underline]it still[/underline] retains
the same constitution the

truths, which [underline]led to[/underline] the

elucidated an [deletion]great[/deletion] immense

M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslie as far as they
claim any relation to [deletion]my[/deletion] the
general subject - |_ On this
point our Views may be
materially assisted by [underline]experiment[/underline]
& I shall endeavour to offer
such sensible illustrations
as may be clear & distinct.
|_ [underline]Natural appearances[/underline] however,
& the great cycle of terrestrial
changes, will afford a copious
narrative of facts. |_ It is
on Heat, that the fluidity
of Water, the elasticity of
Air [insertion]and the form of the soil[/insertion] depend - : It penetrates
every where, & is every where
efficient - "Terrible" in its "[underline]partial[/underline]
destructive and consuming agencies"
It is admirable in its [underline]general[/underline]

and the progress of Vitality
(as it were) follows "the
successions of [insertion]periods &[/insertion] [deletion]the[/deletion] seasons & the
changes of temperature in the

the Earth round the Sun. -
|_ -: [underline]Light[/underline] much less powerful as
as a cause of chemical change
will occupy much less of our
[deletion]attention[/deletion] time.- The Experiments
of the separation of its
rays & their different
chemical effects in their
pure forms, "will afford
some curious matter for
discussion" - The Researches
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Herschell have [deletion]shewn[/deletion] sufficiently
shewn "the [underline]distinctness[/underline] of
[underline]Light[/underline] & [underline]Heat[/underline] -:- But as

[deletion]They[/deletion] [underline]Heat[/underline] usually coexists, with
[underline]Light[/underline] - it is not easy
to determine [deletion]the[/deletion] clearly the
operation of this last agent .-
- It [deletion]influ[/deletion] occasions [insertion]however[/insertion], or at least
influences [deletion]however[/deletion] a great number
of Natural changes - Chrystalizations

a more extensive field of
information & discussion -

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10241-000-00012|dnp02c112pp|97185063[/page]
That power (the demonstration
of which is identical with lightning
& the cause of Thunder - was
one of the greatest philosophical
Triumphs of the last Century.)
There is every reason to believe
it not limited in its operation
to the "Atmosphere" but is
constantly producing the most
important effects in y[superscript]e[/superscript] other great
parts of [deletion]the[/deletion] our system. -
- The Galvanic phaenomena only
[deletion]which never been[/deletion] [insertion]lately [deletion]only lately[/deletion][/insertion] identified
[deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]identified[/insertion] as dependent upon the
same principle have afforded
to us new [insertion]& excellent[/insertion] instruments

The discoveries of Franklin, Volta, Galvani

[underline]own country[/underline], who have eminently enlightened
the subject, will be [underline]successively[/underline]

but I feel full confidence " that
[underline]I do not risque[/underline], the [underline]imputation[/underline]
of Vanity:-" |_The observations
that I have been able
to make will at least
show " the very intimate
relation that exists [deletion]the[/deletion] between the

both abroad, & at home. -

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10241-000-00017|dnp02c117pp|97185068[/page]
- The subject of the Nature, constitution
& agencies of the Atmosphere will
furnish ample courses both
of [deletion]spec[/deletion] theoretical & experimental
elucidation. - |_ The Action
of [deletion]it the[/deletion] one of the constituent
parts of Air upon inflammable
bodies is the Cause of the
beautiful & important phaenomena
of combustion - It is the
medium by which the solar
light & Heat are transmitted
to us; & their powerful
agencies are dependent upon
a peculiar state of its constituent
parts -
Unequally heated by the action
of the sun upon the surface
of the Earth , different strata of Air
are constantly changing their places;
& currents are established which modi =

are absorbed by bodies,- which are
taken into the lungs of animals, as an
essential nourishment, are again sup =

In consequence of changes
in the temperatures of different

in a state of minute division; & hence
arise all the beautiful & varying appear=

earth with vivifying moisture.-
All the particles of the Atmos=

cases of chemical action -
In the great extent of the [underline]Ocean[/underline]; an important
series of effects are constantly taking place. -
Though a number of substances are carried
into it from the land, |_ yet by chemical operations
it is preserved in an uniform state; & its saline
& aqueous parts duly mixed together. - Warmed
by the solar Heat, it diffuses its pure moisture
through the Atmosphere. - Agitated by the
winds & tides, its waves are combined with air;
which dissolved at the surface passes even to the
remotest depths & becomes a [underline]principle of vitality[/underline]
to the beings [underline]inhabiting them[/underline]. - - -
Our [underline]rivers[/underline] & [underline]streams[/underline] which owe their
remote origin to moisture carried by evaporation
from the [insertion]sea [deletion]seas[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]seas to which are again returned into[/deletion]
[deletion]its bosom[/deletion] undergo [insertion]analogous[/insertion] changes [deletion]analogous to those of[/deletion]

The solid surface of the Earth will
next be considered - The theatre
of all the grand changes occuring

the superficial observer is very [underline]often apt[/underline] to

flourish; - What is sometimes

this kind must cease. - And till
