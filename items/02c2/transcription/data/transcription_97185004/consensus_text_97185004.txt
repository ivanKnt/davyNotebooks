- The curious experiment of the apparent
Radiation of Cold made in the
last lecture will admit of
some further discussion - I fear I
was not sufficiently minute or
distinct, in making the statement
of that which appears to me to
be the most satisfactory [underline]explanation[/underline]
of the phaenomenon - & I shall
venture to [deletion]beg[/deletion] [insertion]recall[/insertion] your [underline]attention[/underline]
for a few minutes to the
Subject -
- It was assumed as the foundation
 of the argument that Radiant 
Heat is given out from all bodies
at all known temperatures in quantities
in proportion as these temperatures
are low: & that y[superscript]e[/superscript] equilibrium of
Heat in a great measure depends
upon this interchange from Radiation.
