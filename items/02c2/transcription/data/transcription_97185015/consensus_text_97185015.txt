[deletion]- When Heat is also[/deletion]
- "  |_ Heat in its state of absorption
by Bodies " (as You well know)
is [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] communicated by
direct contact "- - & the
cases of communication constitute
the laws of Temperature -
- When two equal quantities of
the same kind of Matter
of different temperatures are brought
into contact, till they acquire
an equillbrium. - The degree of
Heat after communication [underline]must[/underline]
[underline]necessarily be[/underline] an arithmetical mean
between the two [underline]original[/underline] temperatures
Thus if 1 pound of Mercury at
50 degrees be mixed with
another pound of mercury at 100
the resulting temperature is 75 -
and it is on this necessary
Law [deletion]as I mentioned in[/deletion]
[deletion]the last lecture[/deletion] " that the
indications of the accuracy
of the Scale of the Mercurial
thermometer are founded. -
