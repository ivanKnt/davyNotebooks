Air of very high temperatures :- In a
a Glass House at Bristol where
I was superintending the execution
of some of my apparatus for
philosophical purpose; I had
the curiosity to ascertain by
the thermometer the Heat of
the place in which one of
the workmen [insertion]was[/insertion] whilst taking
the melting glass out of
the [unclear]Pot[/unclear] " - The Thermometer
suspended in the Air indicated
257. - 45 degrees above the
boiling [underline]point of Water[/underline] -
The person informed me that
He could stand there for two
or three minutes only - The
interior of the Glass House
at the height of 3 feet above
the ground out of the
reach of the currents of cold
air " was in most places
above 110Â° - These temperatures
though not immediately destructive
