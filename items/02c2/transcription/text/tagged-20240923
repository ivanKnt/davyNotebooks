- The curious experiment of the apparent
Radiation of Cold made in the
last lecture will admit of
some further discussion - I fear I
was not sufficiently minute or
distinct, in making the statement
of that which appears to me to
be the most satisfactory [underline]explanation[/underline]
of the phaenomenon - & I shall
venture to [deletion]beg[/deletion] [insertion]recall[/insertion] your [underline]attention[/underline]
for a few minutes to the
Subject -
- It was assumed as the foundation
 of the argument that Radiant 
Heat is given out from all bodies
at all known temperatures in quantities
in proportion as these temperatures
are low: & that y[superscript]e[/superscript] equilibrium of
Heat in a great measure depends
upon this interchange from Radiation.

- Now in this system [deletion]of Bodies[/deletion] -
- The Air "Thermometer" receives [underline]R[superscript]t[/superscript] Heat[/underline]
from all the different surrounding
Bodies - : & [deletion]it likewise gives out[/deletion]
[deletion]its own Radiant[/deletion] & the temperatures
being nearly equal it gives out
as much as it receives - " &
no alteration [deletion]of temperature[/deletion]
is perceived. -
But let - a Hot coal
be introduced into the focus
of this [underline]Mirror[/underline]. - The rays
will be sent out parallel. - &
concentered - And in this case
the thermometer will receive
more than it gives out &
the Air in it becomes expanded -
- The converse Happens when
the ice is introduced -" for
in this case "the Thermometer
gives off more R[superscript]t[/superscript] Heat than
it receives. -
- The Rays sent parallel by this

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00003|dnp02c203pp|97185006[/page]
mirror are the few that come
from the ice: - which stops
the Heat [deletion]from[/deletion] that would have
passed from the surface of
[underline]the Mirror[/underline]. - Shade both or
one of the Mirrors" & the
Body employed as a shade [deletion]will[/deletion]
if of an equal temperature
with the thermometer will
by its own radiation restore
it to the mean temperature -
( By the [underline]operation[/underline] of the ice
upon the Mirrors their [underline]own[/underline]
radiant Heat is for the most
part absorbed" & by the [underline]operation[/underline]
of the Mirrors upon the [underline]ice[/underline] a
smaller quantity of Heat than
their own; a smaller
quantity than that radiating
from the Thermometer is concentered
upon it - Its temperature
falls. -
- [person]person_786|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslie[/person] found that the
cooling effect of the ice upon

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00004|dnp02c204pp|97185007[/page]
the thermometer was greater when
the bulb was blackened than
when it remained in its
Natural state: - & this strengthens
the explanation that has been
given - Black bodies radiate
most Heat" - & absorb most
Heat" & as the radiation
from the Thermometer "is in the
[deletion]originally[/deletion] [insertion]primary form[/insertion] supposed to be greater
than the absorption, [deletion]It must[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xx xxxxxxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] so in the secondary
form with the blackened bulb
It must be still greater & more
perceptible. -
[deletion][person]person_786|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslie[/person][/deletion] [insertion]It would appear[/insertion] likewise [insertion]from [person]person_786|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslies[/person] observations[/insertion] [deletion]found[/deletion] that
the refrigerating influence of [unclear]the[/unclear]
ice is more powerful when it is
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] included in a blackened metallic
vessel than in a polished
vessel "-; which also supports
the Hypothesis "for as the ice is
conceived to absorb more radiant Heat
than it gives "out"

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00005|dnp02c205pp|97185008[/page]
so when both effects are increased
that of absorption will appear
the most increased & the one
instance is precisely the
converse of the other. -
- The [deletion]Solar[/deletion] Heat [deletion]as is[/deletion] [insertion]directly coming from[/insertion]
[insertion]the Sun as is [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] evident from all common
Experiments made with burning
Glasses is [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] capable of
being transmitted through
diaphanous [deletion][unclear]Bodies[/unclear][/deletion] solid
& fluid Bodies as well
as through Air; But the
case is not the same with
terrestrial Heat", or even
with the [underline]Solar Heat[/underline] after
it has been once absorbed by
common Bodies " - (A Glass
screen [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]transmits the[/underline]
[underline]Light of[/underline] the fire but
prevents [insertion]in a very great measure[/insertion] the passage of the
Heat " & a plate of Glass
would [deletion]altogether[/deletion] [insertion]almost entirely[/insertion] destroy the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00006|dnp02c206pp|97185009[/page]
of the radiation of Heat in
their mirrors -"  And that

two first forms [deletion]are [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] of
the experiment are generally
known " the last I have
myself tried two or three
times. - & with [underline]perfect success[/underline]. -
- These phaenomena might
reasonably be expected," When
the [underline]Resistance[/underline] which must
necessarily be offered to moving
Bodies by the Media through which
they [underline]pass is considered[/underline]. However
great may be the [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] of

B |_ The passage of [insertion][deletion]botth Solar &[/deletion][/insertion] terrestrial Heat through
Air & its absorption by fluid &
solid bodies are facts of some
[deletion]great[/deletion] consideration in the
survey of the regulating causes
of the temperature of our system -
- For unless Air had been permeable
to terrestrial Heat the Soils (the
[deletion]non[/deletion] impossibility of which I endeavoured
to prove in the last lecture) would
inevitably happen; & the constant
accumulation of [underline]fire[/underline] would at length

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00009|dnp02c209pp|97185012[/page]
Soon after these curious facts had been
announced some objections were made
to D[superscript]r[/superscript] Herschells methods of operating;
but new experiments conducted
by very able & judicious philosophical
persons fully confirmed the [insertion]principal [/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]observations[/deletion] [insertion]results[/insertion] - [person]person_090|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Pictet[/person] &
[person]person_864|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Prevost[/person] both gave their testimony
in favour of the existence of
the invisible Heat making rays
less refrangible than the rays
of light : - And in a process
conducted by Sir H[superscript]y[/superscript] Englefield
which I had the pleasure of
witnessing the phaenomenon was
in the highest degree distinct. -
- All causes of interference were
carefully avoided - The different
Rays separated by the prism
were respectively concentered in
the focus of a lens &
successively thrown upon a very

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00010|dnp02c210pp|97185013[/page]
delicate thermometer " - The temperature
became elevated in the different
rays in the order described;
& on the least refrangible side
where the blush of red scarcely
extended " the increase of Heat
in the focus was considerably
the greatest . " -
- There seem to have always
existed some popular notions
[deletion]which might have indicated[/deletion] [insertion]conformable to [/insertion]
this discovery - Thus red
& orange are called warm
colours; & blue & violet cold
colours - And in these instances
the evidence of the senses
as it were preceded the
refinements of philosophical
observation - The properties
of burning " Bodies " likewise
might confirm or assist
the [insertion]idea[/insertion] [deletion]notion[/deletion] "- For the red
glow of ignited metal of coals

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00011|dnp02c211pp|97185014[/page]
is infinitely stronger in its effects
than the blue flame of
[deletion]Alcohol or[/deletion] [insertion][chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical][/insertion] or spirits of Wine -
- The existence of invisible Heat
making beams had been suspected
by [person]person_125|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/person] "- He [insertion]indeed[/insertion] conceived
that all radiant Heat was
merely light in another form: -
but His opinions were [deletion]merely[/deletion],
the result of Speculation &
warranted by no experiments"-
- In [otherwork]otherwork_121|The Epicurean[/otherwork] [deletion]school[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] a [underline]similar Hypothesis[/underline] was
maintained & [person]person_508|Lucretius[/person]
devellopes it in his fifth
book in attempting to
account " [deletion]of[/deletion] for the permanency
of the Solar fires "-
" Or else the Sun emits
Besides the Heavenly golden light of day,
Invisible elements of potent Heat "
Which burn for ever "

[deletion]- When Heat is also[/deletion]
- "  |_ Heat in its state of absorption
by Bodies " (as You well know)
is [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] communicated by
direct contact "- - & the
cases of communication constitute
the laws of Temperature -
- When two equal quantities of
the same kind of Matter
of different temperatures are brought
into contact, till they acquire
an equillbrium. - The degree of
Heat after communication [underline]must[/underline]
[underline]necessarily be[/underline] an arithmetical mean
between the two [underline]original[/underline] temperatures
Thus if 1 pound of [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] at
50 degrees be mixed with
another pound of [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] at 100
the resulting temperature is 75 -
and it is on this necessary
Law [deletion]as I mentioned in[/deletion]
[deletion]the last lecture[/deletion] " that the
indications of the accuracy
of the Scale of the Mercurial
thermometer are founded. -

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00013|dnp02c213pp|97185016[/page]

- . " |_ When two [underline]unequal[/underline] quantities of
the same species of Bodies of
[underline]different temperatures[/underline], are made
to act upon each other; [deletion]In[/deletion]
[deletion]this case[/deletion] :- In this case their
[deletion]Heat[/deletion] [insertion]Heat[/insertion] is divided according "
according to their respective
temperatures & quantities of
Matter. " Thus I found of [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
at 50 & two Pounds at 100°
will produce a mean temperature
of about 83. -
- And in all cases " |_ there is the
same principle with regard to
the communication of Heat
in the same species of Matter;
|_ but with different species [deletion]of[/deletion]
[deletion]matter[/deletion] there is a [underline]different[/underline]
, [underline]Law[/underline]. -
Thus if equal weights of
Water [insertion]at [underline]50[/underline][/insertion] & of Gold at [underline]150[/underline] ° be
brought in contact & agitated
till they acquire a common
temperature " this temperature will

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00014|dnp02c214pp|97185017[/page]
not be [insertion]found to be[/insertion] the arithmetical Mean
100° but it will be [deletion]25°[/deletion] [insertion]55[/insertion]. -
With other Bodies there are still
greater differences " & in common
Philosophical language these
differences are said to depend "
upon their " [underline]capacity for[/underline]
[underline]Heat[/underline] "- This [underline]word[/underline]
was invented by [person]person_922|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Crawford[/person]
it is not perhapss strictly correct
as it involves a mechanical
notion " but it has been
generally used; & the application
of it may be made without
any reference to its Etymology. -
- |_ [underline]The Capacity[/underline] of a Body
for Heat is said to be
great or small in proportion
as its temperature is more
or less raised by the
addition [deletion]of[/deletion] or diminished
by the subtraction of equal

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00015|dnp02c215pp|97185018[/page]
quantities of Heat. - Thus in
the Exp[superscript]t[/superscript] just mentioned; in,
which the quantity of Gold
is said to be at 150° & the
equal quantity of Water at 50°
& the resulting temperature 55°
It follows that the Water
gains 5 only whilst the Gold
looses 95 - So that the
Capacity of Water is very
much greater than that of
Gold " as indeed 95 to 5
or as 19 to 1. - -
- [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] Substances in general
have much greater capacities for
Heat than fluids "- & fluids
than Solids: - And in the
communication of the Heat
of the Globe - |_ the Atmosphere
& the Ocean [deletion]are[/deletion] in receiving
Heat from the Solid parts
undergo a [underline]slight elevation[/underline] only

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00016|dnp02c216pp|97185019[/page]
of temperature only; & are constantly
prepared by their great
absorbing powers; to restore the
equilibrium of communicated
Heat & to prevent its detrimental
excess -
Bodies, besides being differently
affected in temperatures [deletion]with[/deletion]
[deletion]regard to[/deletion] by the addition
of the same quantity of Heat.
have likewise another property
with regard to it " |_ [underline]They[/underline]
[underline]give it out[/underline] & receive
[underline]it on contact[/underline] with very
[underline]different degrees of quickness[/underline] -
[underline]Thus[/underline] a [underline]piece[/underline] of [deletion]Metal[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_201|[insertion]Zinc[/insertion][/chemical] held
near a candle will become
Heated much sooner than
a piece of Glass - This
power is called the
Conducting power with regard
to Heat " & the [deletion]Metal[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_201|[insertion]Zinc[/insertion][/chemical] is
said to be a better

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00017|dnp02c217pp|97185020[/page]
conductor than the Glass -
- In general those Bodies that
have the least capacity for Heat
are the best conductors & vice versa -
- Thus metals conduct better than
[deletion]Glass[/deletion] [insertion][chemical]chemical_157|Vitreous[/chemical][/insertion] or stoney substances, Solids
better than fluids & fluids
better than Gasses - |_ It is
not possible to touch without
a painful sensation a piece
of Metal at 140 . - Water
a less perfect conductor may
be applied to the hands
without injuring them at 170 -
[deletion]Spirits[/deletion] [insertion]of wine[/insertion] [deletion]of Wine[/deletion] - - And Air
at temperatures above 212°
above the boiling point of
Water is very supportable " -
- This last assertion is proved
by many curious exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]., - In
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Fordyces Heated Rooms

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00018|dnp02c218pp|97185021[/page]
[person]person_144|Sir Joseph Banks[/person] remained
exposed to a temperature
in which Water boiled
for several minutes: &
M[superscript]r[/superscript] C[superscript]o[/superscript] [person]person_142|Blagden[/person] & D[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_205|Solander[/person]
made similar Trials - &
suffered principally from
oppressed respiration; but
no scalding or burning
from the contact of
Air "- In these cases
the[insertion]y[/insertion] could not touch Water
when introduced into the
Chamber, " & their metallic
Buttons & watch chains
immediately burnt their
hands -
- In Sugar Houses & still more
frequently in Glass Houses, the
Workmen remain long exposed to

Air of very high temperatures :- In a
a Glass House at [place]place_292|Bristol[/place] where
I was superintending the execution
of some of my apparatus for
philosophical purpose; I had
the curiosity to ascertain by
the thermometer the Heat of
the place in which one of
the workmen [insertion]was[/insertion] whilst taking
the melting glass out of
the [unclear]Pot[/unclear] " - The Thermometer
suspended in the Air indicated
257. - 45 degrees above the
boiling [underline]point of Water[/underline] -
The person informed me that
He could stand there for two
or three minutes only - The
interior of the Glass House
at the height of 3 feet above
the ground out of the
reach of the currents of cold
air " was in most places
above 110° - These temperatures
though not immediately destructive

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00020|dnp02c220pp|97185023[/page]
injure considerably the Health of
the workmen who in general
are very short lived: -
-: Furnaces of a new construction
Exposed to the free Air are
however I am happy to
say coming into [deletion]general[/deletion] use
& with the most beneficial
effects " -
- :- The Bodies that give
out their heat with facility
likewise receive it with facility
& the converse . - . The term [underline]bad[/underline]
or good [underline]Conductor[/underline] applies
to both cases equally. -
Thus water is colder to
the touch at 40° than
Air at 20° .-. |_ [deletion]As I mentioned[/deletion]
[deletion]in the last lecure[/deletion] - |_ Metals "
as I [deletion]just now[/deletion] mentioned in the beginning
at very low temperatures at
the point of congelation of
[chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical], cannot be
applied to the hands without [insertion]injury[/insertion]

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00021|dnp02c221pp|97185024[/page]
So rapidly do they abstract the Heat
of the Body ; But fur & cloathing, very
bad conductors, produce no such effects;-
And the whole body may be exposed
to Air; [insertion]at 60° below 0° even[/insertion] without any permanent in=

has been experienced by [person]person_265|Professor Pallas[/person]
in [place]place_990|Siberia[/place] & by different [deletion]Gentle[/deletion]men [insertion]Persons[/insertion]

Moist Air conducts Heat much
better than dry Air - " Thus
[person]person_321|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Fordyce[/person] in his heated
Room found " that He could
support for some minutes
the temperature of 260°
when no substances capable
of furnishing moisture were
present - " & this high degree
of Heat was not much more
offensive, than a temperature
below 200 when [deletion]moist[/deletion] water
was present " -
- In keen frosts when the
Air is very dry - the sensation

And the unhealthiness of

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00024|dnp02c224pp|97185027[/page]
in moist situations probably
in a great measure depends
upon the too high conducting
power of the damp Air

[deletion]at Hudson Bay[/deletion] -
- : - It was [insertion]just now[/insertion] shown [deletion]in the last[/deletion]

circumstance combined with
the extreme slowness of the
communication of Heat in
water & Air led Count
[underline][person]person_143|Rumford[/person][/underline] to consider them
as [underline]nonconductors[/underline] altogether
& incapable of being Heated
or cooled by any communication
of temperature between
their own particles -
- : This " conclusion however
has been shown [underline]to be[/underline]
contradictory to a number
of [underline]facts[/underline] : - " & it would
appear that the Count
has carried the generalization
from his [underline]curious[/underline] exp[superscript]ts[/superscript],
a little [underline]too far[/underline] -
- I witnessed some Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
made by a philosophical
Society in which [chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical]

was heated downwards by means
of " lamp " which furnished " Heat "
immediately only to the
surface of the metal - And
the same thing has been shewn
with regard to Water by
[person]person_226|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Thomson[/person] & M[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_127|Murray[/person] &
the last of [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]these[/insertion] Gentleman
very happily made use of Vessels
composed of ice " the sides of
which could communicate no
Heat " -.
And in this case the source
of Heat being above " the
water still had its temperature
raised below -
- The effect as might reasonably
be expected from the change of
place of the Heated liquor is
exceedingly slow in taking
place.
How slow it is may be shewn

[page]28|MS-DAVY-10242-000-00028|dnp02c228pp|97185031[/page]
very satisfactorily in an expt which
will be very [underline]visible[/underline]
- If Ether be inflamed above
the surface of water: &
an Air Thermometer plunged
immediately below the surface
[deletion]of the water[/deletion] - many minutes
will be required to produce
any effect upon it -: at
last however [deletion]the[/deletion] an effect
will be perceived - & it
sufficiently proves that
Heat may be propagated
downwards in fluids :-
- [underline]Instance[/underline] -
And a general expression of
the fact "- Is that the
particles of fluids & Gasses
though they rapidly change their
places when heated yet do
not change them [deletion]with[/deletion] so
rapidly as they conduct [underline]Heat[/underline]:

is not so great as the celerity
of their communicating power -
- The slow conducting power
of the [deletion]nature of[/deletion] Atmosphere & the ocean

interesting circumstances in the
Oeconomy of Nature. -

undergoing them without
being fatal to animal or
Vegetable life - And the

that is to say if it is a solid

if it is fluid as long as
it remains so; - &the like of
the rest; but if it changes
its form - " that is if a solid
becomes a fluid, or a
fluid a solid; - the
capacity immediately alters
& in this case [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion], it gives
out or receives that
Heat which in consequence
of its peculiar relation to
the Heat of temperature is
usually called latent Hent
or Caloric of combination

So as to become ice, its capacity
ceratinly diminishes; But the
contrary effect takes place
when it is conceived into
steam for in this case its
capacity is wonderfully increased.
- During the conversion of [underline]ice[/underline]

be mixed together - The Ice
will be melted; but the whole
