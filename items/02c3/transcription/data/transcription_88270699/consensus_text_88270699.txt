better than Water [insertion]ie "that the Electric fluid experiences [deletion][unclear]so little[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the same[/insertion] resistance in passing along an iron wire 4000000 millions of inches long as a column of water of the same diameter of an inch[/insertion]. - [deletion]That sea water[/deletion]
(He has likewise concluded that sea water
conducts 100 times better than
common water; & a saturated
solution of salt 7 times better
 than sea water: - ie that
the resistance these different bodies
oppose to the passage of the
Electrical fluid is capable of
being expressed by [deletion]these[/deletion] [insertion]such[/insertion] numbers
- There is another circumstance of
still more importance with regard
to the [underline]communication[/underline] of [underline]Electricity[/underline].
- The same Body is a much less efficient

[underline]quantity[/underline] of Electricity; when the fluid
is diffused over a [underline]large[/underline] surface
than when it is concentrated
in a small area. -
Let the Electricity of a phial

column of water [insertion]by a single contact[/insertion] be communicated
to a Jar of six times [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxt xxxxing[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] the surface,
[deletion]the Electricity[/deletion] & it will require
a much longer time for its discharge
