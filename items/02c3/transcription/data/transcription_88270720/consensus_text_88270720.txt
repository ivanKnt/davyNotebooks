- Sulphur, Glass, Sealing wax are
all rendered actively electrical
by Heat - Their parts expand
their capacity for electricity
increases "& the fluid is
attracted from conductors so
as to render them negative
- If Glass Sulphur or sealing
Wax during the act of
the elevation of temperature
be brought in contact with
metals they render the
Metals negative -
- In cooling | a contraction of
parts takes place; & the
Capacity is diminished
the contrary [insertion]Electrical[/insertion] effect follows
& the conductors in contact
are rendered positive -
The Gems & chrystalized stones
exhibit in a remarkable manner
this agency of Heat "- The Tourmalin
when [deletion]heated[/deletion] [insertion]its temperature is elevated[/insertion] exhibits two
electrified poles in the direction
of the axis of the chrystal
one positive the other negative. -
