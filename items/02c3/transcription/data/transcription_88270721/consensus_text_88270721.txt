In cooling the electricity of the
poles changes, that which before
was negative becomes positive;
-& chrystals: that have more
than one axis such as
the Boracite & fluor spar
exhibit two poles for each
axis & offer respectively the
same phaenomena as the
poles of the Tourmalin
- When Bodies from Solids
are converted into fluids or
from fluids into Solids
their electrical capacity
necessarily changes - Sulphur
at the point of fusion becomes
negative; but when It is
chrystalized from a fluid state
it is in a high degree
positive -
In instances of Evaporation
in which Fluids or Solids are
converted by Heat into aÃ«riform
