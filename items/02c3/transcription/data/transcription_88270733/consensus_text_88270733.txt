These phaenomena of Sound
Heat & Light are analogous.
- Sound is an undulation of
Air; & the explosion of
Electricity may be easily accounted
for from "the violent
expansion which it communicates
to the [underline]surrounding Air[/underline] - &
the continuous & varying noise
of Thunder is easily explained
from this circumstance - "that
Sound moves in sensible time
at the rate of 8 Miles in
a Minute - Whereas Electricity
appears to be infinitely rapid
in its motions - Where Lightning
has passed through a considerable
extent of the Atmosphere - We
hear the first sound in the
part of the Air which has been
[underline]agitated, that is nearest[/underline] to us
