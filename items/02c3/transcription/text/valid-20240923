Principles of
[underline]Elect: Science[/underline]
It is not from a want of respect
to the Elementary writers on the
subject [insertion]of Electricity[/insertion] that I adopt [insertion]shall I in these lectures[/insertion] a different
order of considering the phaenomena,
Their labours have been highly
meritorious; the views of many of
them truly exalted - & philosophical:
But the progress of the Science
has been most rapid - Within
the last few years it has
made y[superscript]e[/superscript] grandst advances - New
& most extraodinary combinations
have develloped new & most
extraordinary truths; & a
change of theory [deletion]in the[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] or more properly speaking
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]a novel[/insertion] arrangement of facts is

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00002|dnp02c302pp|88270692[/page]
the necessary consequence of a new
 creation of Discovery. -
- In the former [deletion]course[/deletion] [insertion]series[/insertion] of lectures
which I have had the honour
of delivering in this theatre
I made a distinction between
Galvanism & Electricity.
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] I considered them under
separate heads - The appearances
[deletion]facts[/deletion] proved [insertion]indeed[/insertion] that they depended
upon the the same agent;
but at that time "there
was no common principle
of explanation; no general
expression equally applicable
to both series of phaenomena.
- In the investigation [deletion]upon[/deletion]
which I am [insertion]now[/insertion] about to enter upon,
I shall [underline]combine[/underline] [underline]both[/underline] [underline]subjects[/underline].
Some illustrations have

 occurred which will will [deletion]combine[/deletion] [insertion]connect[/insertion]
the [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion]truths[/insertion] currently known &
the new [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion][underline]truths[/underline][/insertion] - by close analogies.
- The [deletion]happy[/deletion] wonderful instrument, the
invention of which we owe to
the happy [underline]genius of[/underline] Volta, has
elucidated the whole of this
mysterious branch of Natural
philosophy: & will be proud to
have united it in the most
distinct manner with the
refined doctrines of Chemistry. -
- The [underline]facts[/underline] of Electricity have
been rapidly [deletion]accumulating[/deletion] [insertion]collecting[/insertion] for
a century & half. [deletion]& they are[/deletion]
[deletion]exceedingly numerous & developed -[/deletion]
The brilliant & singular nature
of the appearances, the effects
of the apparatus similar to
those attributed to magic, & the
facility of making experiments

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00004|dnp02c304pp|88270694[/page]
have led to an immense accumulation
of [deletion]facts[/deletion]. them. - To follow the
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx xxxxxx general[/unclear][/deletion] series [deletion]of[/deletion]
[deletion]the collection of instances[/deletion] [insertion]in particular[/insertion] & to
deduce the Laws from the
phaenomena; [deletion]though generally the[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]in most cases[/deletion][/insertion]
[deletion]most [unclear]proper[/unclear] & most[/deletion][insertion][deletion]correct &[/deletion][/insertion] applicable
[deletion]for investigating & illustrating[/deletion]
[deletion]Science[/deletion]. Though it is a
method usually happy &
applicable would on this
occasion be improper - The
Mind would be perplexed with
the number of similar appearances &
- Those the most magnificent
the most impressive to [deletion]for[/deletion] the
eye [deletion]would[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] perhaps the least
connected with the [deletion]deliberations[/deletion] [insertion]theory[/insertion]
of the Science. - I conceive
it will be more fit "that
I should state first "the" [deletion]principles[/deletion]
[underline]general principles[/underline] as derived

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00005|dnp02c305pp|88270695[/page]

from a comparison of the most
important facts - [deletion]I shall then[/deletion]
[deletion]illustrate[/deletion] that I should [insertion]then[/insertion] illustrate
them by experiments, - apply them
where [deletion]they[/deletion] I can [deletion]be applied[/deletion]
to the application of phaenomena
[deletion]of[/deletion] in Nature - and last of all, -
[underline]consider[/underline] them in their Historical
relations, as testimonies of
Human industry & ingenuity -
In the General View which
I shall attempt [insertion]& to which this I[superscript]e[/superscript] will be from introd[superscript]n[/superscript][/insertion] I shall probably
make many statements of the
same kind, as those which my
friend [underline]Mr Allen[/underline] must have
introduced in the lecture
He was so good as to deliver
for me on Saturday: - This
will be unavoidable; - In a
chain of connected [underline]propositions[/underline],
the loss of a single link would

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00006|dnp02c306pp|88270696[/page]
destroy the whole of the evidence:
& I shall [deletion]rather[/deletion] [insertion]rather risque[/insertion] such repetitions
than meet [underline]the chance[/underline], of being
[underline]obscure[/underline], & unintelligible. -
The common Effects of Electricity
are too well known to need
any Experimental illustrations
- The Shocks that it occasions
in its concentrated state,
Its power of rending & passing
through solid Bodies, the
infinite rapidity of its motion
are all [underline]distinct indications[/underline]
of the [deletion]exi[/deletion] dependence of
the phaenomena upon [deletion]an[/deletion]
[deletion]active &[/deletion] subtile material
Agent, diffused upon every
part of our Globe; & [deletion]constantly[/deletion]
uniformly capable of being
[deletion]excited[/deletion] rendered active & powerful.
It is on this idea that M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Epinus have founded
their mathematical Theories of Electricity: it is on this idea that

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00007|dnp02c307pp|88270697[/page]
the phaenomena are most easily and satisfactorily explained

- (The first [deletion]properties[/deletion] [insertion]general principle[/insertion] which it is necessary
to consider with regard to Electricity
or the properties of the "Electric
fluid" is "That it is communicated
from the Bodies containing it
with very different degrees of
velocity & in very different
manners (& Hence the distinction
of Conductors, imperfect conductors
& nonconductors.
- When I apply my hand to
this Brass which is actively
electrified - I receive a spark
but after this effect "no
other parts of y[superscript]e[/superscript] Mass will give
[deletion]communicate[/deletion] a new spark -
They have communicated the
Electricity to each other, -
the Body is a conductor
"paper - imperfect" conductor.
- This Cake of [underline]Resin[/underline] is electrified
- I take a spark from this
part, I can likewise take
a spark from another part

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00008|dnp02c308pp|88270698[/page]
-& from every portion of the
surface - this substance
is a nonconductor -
- [deletion]The Metals & [insertion][deletion]well burnt[/deletion][/insertion] charcoal are[/deletion]
[deletion]The most pas - The Conductors[/deletion]
- Amongst the different materials
[deletion]composing our globe, the metals[/deletion]
the powers of which it is essential
to Know. The metals, charcoal
& certain of their combinations
are conductors - Water, - [deletion]Acids[/deletion],
[deletion][unclear]xxxx xxx[/unclear], rarified air are[/deletion] [insertion]and aqueous solutions, rarified air are[/insertion]
imperfect conductors. -
[insertion]Dense[/insertion] Air, pure inflammable [insertion]compound[/insertion] fluids
[insertion]& solids[/insertion] Gems, dry earthy Bodies &
their compounds are nonconductors
- It must however be understood "that
in [underline]each of these three[/underline] classes "there
are [underline]immense differences[/underline] with regard
to the [underline]degree[/underline] of conducting energy.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish has computed from
some very good data - that Iron
wire conducts 400.000.000 times

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00009|dnp02c309pp|88270699[/page]

better than Water [insertion]ie "that the Electric fluid experiences [deletion][unclear]so little[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the same[/insertion] resistance in passing along an iron wire 4000000 millions of inches long as a column of water of the same diameter of an inch[/insertion]. - [deletion]That sea water[/deletion]
(He has likewise concluded that sea water
conducts 100 times better than
common water; & a saturated
solution of salt 7 times better
 than sea water: - ie that
the resistance these different bodies
oppose to the passage of the
Electrical fluid is capable of
being expressed by [deletion]these[/deletion] [insertion]such[/insertion] numbers
- There is another circumstance of
still more importance with regard
to the [underline]communication[/underline] of [underline]Electricity[/underline].
- The same Body is a much less efficient
[deletion]perfect[/deletion] conductor of [underline]the same[/underline]
[underline]quantity[/underline] of Electricity; when the fluid
is diffused over a [underline]large[/underline] surface
than when it is concentrated
in a small area. -
Let the Electricity of a phial
which could be discharged by this
column of water [insertion]by a single contact[/insertion] be communicated
to a Jar of six times [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxt xxxxing[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] the surface,
[deletion]the Electricity[/deletion] & it will require
a much longer time for its discharge

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00010|dnp02c310pp|88270703[/page]
& by using a jar of a thousand
times the surface; the Water
would have no perceptible
effect. - In these cases
the the power of motion of the
Electricity or as it usually
called its [underline]intensity[/underline] is diminished
in the proportion of the increase
of surface "& "[underline]the 'efficacy[/underline]
of [underline]imperfect conductors[/underline] in carrying
off [underline]Electricity is directly as[/underline]
[underline]its intensity[/underline], I wish to
induce you to fix your
attention upon this point.
It will hereafter be found to
admit of important theoretical
applications. -
- It is in consequence of the
different powers of Bodies
with regard to the communication
of Electricity "that We are
enabled to insulate [insertion]different[/insertion]
[insertion]substances &[/insertion]
to examine their states [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]After the[/deletion] [insertion]And [deletion]the[/deletion] to exhibit the[/insertion] energies of our

artificial instruments [deletion]are[/deletion] - In
Nature - by the [deletion]different combination[/deletion]
[deletion]&[/deletion] arrangement of the different
classes of Bodies - the [deletion]equilibrium[/deletion] [insertion]distribution[/insertion]
[insertion]of Electricity is rendered equable[/insertion] [deletion]when broken is soon restored[/deletion]
[deletion]& no generally dang[/deletion] [insertion]& any great [deletion]& any great[/deletion][/insertion]
& generally destructive disturbance,
of it, prevented. -
- The next principle for our
examination "is that Bodies
actively electrified "may be in
different states " - may possess
an excess of the fluid or
a deficiency of it, ie may
be positive or negative -
- The two cylinders of Nairnes
machines give sparks - were
they similarly electrified
the effect ought to be
increased by connecting them
but it is not increased

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00012|dnp02c312pp|88270705[/page]
it is destroyed - [underline]They are[/underline] therefore
in different states - This
in contact with the silk is
said to be negative, the
other positive - The Ballance
of power is restored "the Electricity
regains its natural state by
their natural action. -
[insertion]Glass, sealing wax[/insertion]
- This expression of facts
forms the most important
foundation of the Science"
- The same quantity of Fluid
is supposed to exist in
all cases - & [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]an[/insertion] accumulation
in one part of the system
must necessarily be connected
with an equal deficiency
in some other part." - We
owe this discovery to the
sagacity of Frankin &
it reduces the whole of the

[insertion]remaining[/insertion] enquiry . into an enquiry concerning
the "causes that [underline]disturb[/underline], &
those that [underline]restore[/underline] "the [deletion]natural[/deletion] [insertion]general[/insertion]
equilibrium of Electricity. -
- One of the most important
propositions with regard to the
disturbance of the Electrical
Equilibrium is -" [underline]That different[/underline]
Bodies [underline]are capable of attracting[/underline]
[underline]Electricity from their Bodies[/underline]
[underline]so that when brought in contact[/underline]
[underline]they become themselves[/underline] [deletion]slight[/deletion]
[underline]positive & render the others[/underline]
[underline]negative."[/underline] -
- When a plate of Zinc insulated
by means of a Glass handle is
brought in contact with a
surface of Mercury likewise
insulated & afterwards separated
the Zinc is found positively electrical
the Mercury [underline]negatively[/underline] electrical. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00014|dnp02c314pp|88270707[/page]
This phaenomena does not depend
upon any chemical action between
the Metals "- for the case is
analogous - if Mercury & Iron
which do not amalgamate
be used. - nor does it
depend upon any common
mechanical causes: for
the effect is produced
to the same extent by
[insertion]a gentle[/insertion] [deletion]simple[/deletion] [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] contact as by
pressure or by rubbing -
Nor does the chemical
operation of the Air interfere -
For [deletion]in a damp atmosphere[/deletion] [insertion]It succeeds best in a dry[/insertion]
[deletion]In which Zinc it[/deletion] [insertion]Atmosphere in which, Zinc &[/insertion]
Iron are incapable of
oxidation & it does not
succeed in a moist atmosphere
in which they are susceptible
of chemical change. -

which "no Hypotheses of
explanation can be applied. -
- The circumstance "of Bodies
disturbing the Electrical equilibrium
by certain inherent powers "[deletion]was[/deletion]

of which occured to Newton. -
& this illustrious Man has
in a manner predicted it
in the third Book of his
Optics." - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bennet

1787. [deletion]has[/deletion] described various Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
in which Bodies after being
made to touch each other
were found oppositely Electrified;

application of the appearance"
The statement of it as a

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00016|dnp02c316pp|88270709[/page]
a new & peculiar principle
was made by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Volta.
- He first exhibited it as
a sensible appearance in
the case of Copper & of
Zinc & "conceived that it
would be found very extensive
in its operation -
- The Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of the Philosopher
of Pavia extend only to Metals
or conducting substances - | but I
find that the same property
belongs to nonconducting substances
& is often exhibited by them
in a much higher degree.

When an insulated metallic
surface is brought in contact

- And Acid & alkaline
substances are with regard

When a piece of dry Quicklime
for instance is placed upon chrystals
of oxalic Acid - & separated
the Quicklime is found positive
the acid negative.

- This Electromotive faculty or
as it may perhaps with more
propriety be called this Electrical
Energy [deletion]prob[/deletion] is probably common
to all material substances -
ie it is most likely "that
there is no Body existing
[deletion]which will not be found[/deletion]
[deletion]ca[/deletion] which is not capable
of being rendered positive
or negative by the contact
of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] certain other bodies:
& - the general principle
offers a great number
of applications -" & elucidates
[deletion]a number of[/deletion] [insertion]many[/insertion] phaenomena
before obscure or only very
imperfectly known -

- In the early exp[superscript]t[/superscript] of Salzer [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion]
has lately [deletion]been[/deletion] [insertion]become[/insertion] so much a
subject of discussion "in which"
a strong caustic taste is produced
by the contact of Zinc &
silver with the Tongue - The
effect is merely owing to [deletion]the[/deletion]
Electrical energy -. The Zinc
is rendered positive the silver
negative by the contact; &
the equilibrium is restored
through the animal substance -
- The same explanation "[deletion]will[/deletion] belongs
to the experiments of Galvani.
in which the [deletion]nerves &[/deletion] muscles
of Animals are made to
contract after death by
the application of different
metals" The Electrical
equilibrium is disturbed by

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00020|dnp02c320pp|88270713[/page]
the contacts [underline]of the metals[/underline], [deletion]or[/deletion]
[deletion]by[/deletion] with each other; or
with substances they
are capable [underline]of acting[/underline] upon -
It is restored through the
nerves & muscles "& [insertion]the fluid[/insertion] acts
[deletion]merely[/deletion] as a powerful stimulus
on those parts which
yet retain some irritability
- M Fabbroni referred these
affects to [deletion]the[/deletion] chemical changes
produced by the metals "upon
the Animal fluid. & till
the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Volta on contact
were published, this opinion
appeared to me by far
the most probable. - We
shall hereafter see that
chemical changes are
likewise concerned; but
not as primary causes,

- their relation to the electrical
energies of Bodies will be
an object (I hope an interesting
object) for our future consideration
- The principle of Electrical
energy is immediately related
to the Excitation of Electricity
by friction - A plate of dry smooth
Glass when brought in contact
with a piece of Silk & separated
is found pos: the Silk is
negative - A plate of Metal
laid upon a piece of Glass
[deletion]is rendered[/deletion] & examined after
contact is found neg ; the
Glass is Pos: - Glass made
to touch an amalgam of
Quicksilver is positive the
Quicksilver negative -
In the common Electrical
Machine: The friction may
be considered as a succession

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00022|dnp02c322pp|88270715[/page]
of contacts - in which the
positive electricity is carried
to a conductor from the
Glass - & in which the
Equilibrium is restored [insertion]with regard[/insertion] to
the [underline]negative agents[/underline], the
silk [underline]& the amalgam by[/underline]
communication with the ground. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- The [underline]same mode[/underline] of explanation
will [underline]apply to y[superscript]e[/superscript] other[/underline]
[underline]similar cases of excitation;[/underline]
[underline]where nonconductors,[/underline] or
imperfect conductors
are employed - The electrical
energies of the Bodies may
be conceived to be kept
in constant activity by
the successive contacts
of different surfaces. -
- In the common Explanation
that is given of the production

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00023|dnp02c323pp|88270716[/page]
of Electricity by friction it is
is [unclear]xxxxxned[/unclear] that the the
fluid is pressed out of
the pores of the acting
Bodies by y[superscript]e[/superscript] mechanical agency. -
"but this unrefined idea
does not offer a solution
of the problem, it merely
substitutes [deletion]one property[/deletion] one mode
of operation for another - for
it is not easy to assign
why silk should press
Electricity out of the pores of
Glass or why glass should
cause it to flow from silk:
- If considering it as dependent
upon the Electrical Energy upon
the inherent powers of the
different Bodies - It is referred
to a simple cause: & it

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00024|dnp02c324pp|88270717[/page]
is one of the Newtonian maxims
of philosophising "that no more
[unclear]powers[/unclear] should be assumed " than
are adequate to account
for an effect - Other
Agencies [insertion]as we shall immediately see[/insertion] may sometimes interfere
in cases of friction; but
there is [deletion]great[/deletion] [insertion]good[/insertion] reason to
beleive that its great
operation is [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] what
I have just described
[deletion]What these agencies are[/deletion] [insertion]The electrical Energies of[/insertion]

[deletion]next proposition[/deletion] [insertion]of giving or receiving[/insertion]

operation in all the different
Kingdoms of Nature - The
particles of the Air cannot
move upon the surface of the
Earth or upon the Waters
without producing some electrical
charges. - The motions of the
fluids of the Globe must
be connected with similar effects -
| And even in the solid strata
beneath the surface "the contact
of metallic ores, with the
Rocks by which they
are invelloped & the associations
of the different Earths [insertion]in a moist state[/insertion] may
be a a source of alteration
in those parts of the system which
appear most fixed & immutable. -
- At present it is true little
more than conjecture can be
advanced in these subjects.
but there is an ample field
for investigation - a field

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00026|dnp02c326pp|88270719[/page]
not merely promising insulated
facts or amusing experiments;
but the extension & devellopment
of a principle which must
certainly be [insertion]every where[/insertion] in continued
operation & which (from
analogy we may conclude)
[underline]must[/underline] [underline]perform[/underline] a very
[underline]important[/underline] [underline]part[/underline] in the
[underline]order &[/underline] [underline]oeconomy[/underline] of our
system. -
In following the natural
order of the subject " The
Excitement of Electricity by
the change of the capacities
of Bodies now claims our
attention - [underline]And the principle[/underline]
[underline]is "that when Bodies change[/underline]
[underline]their Volume or their forms[/underline]
[underline]of existence by Heat or[/underline]
[underline]by mechanical operations[/underline], [deletion]Electric[/deletion]
[underline]Electricity[/underline] [underline]is develloped[/underline]. -

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00027|dnp02c327pp|88270720[/page]
- Sulphur, Glass, Sealing wax are
all rendered actively electrical
by Heat - Their parts expand
their capacity for electricity
increases "& the fluid is
attracted from conductors so
as to render them negative
- If Glass Sulphur or sealing
Wax during the act of
the elevation of temperature
be brought in contact with
metals they render the
Metals negative -
- In cooling | a contraction of
parts takes place; & the
Capacity is diminished
the contrary [insertion]Electrical[/insertion] effect follows
& the conductors in contact
are rendered positive -
The Gems & chrystalized stones
exhibit in a remarkable manner
this agency of Heat "- The Tourmalin
when [deletion]heated[/deletion] [insertion]its temperature is elevated[/insertion] exhibits two
electrified poles in the direction
of the axis of the chrystal
one positive the other negative. -

[page]28|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00028|dnp02c328pp|88270721[/page]
In cooling the electricity of the
poles changes, that which before
was negative becomes positive;
-& chrystals: that have more
than one axis such as
the Boracite & fluor spar
exhibit two poles for each
axis & offer respectively the
same phaenomena as the
poles of the Tourmalin
- When Bodies from Solids
are converted into fluids or
from fluids into Solids
their electrical capacity
necessarily changes - Sulphur
at the point of fusion becomes
negative; but when It is
chrystalized from a fluid state
it is in a high degree
positive -
In instances of Evaporation
in which Fluids or Solids are
converted by Heat into aëriform

substances there is an analogous; but
a stranger change. -
- A Drop of Water thrown upon
Hot coal or metal renders
it negative "the capacity
of the Vapour is greater than
of the fluid & electricity
is abstracted . -
- A cold insulated metal
plunged into steam so as to
occasion a condensation
of water is [underline][insertion]found[/insertion] positive[/underline]. -
- The cases are analogous to
the cases of changes of capacity
for Heat. " - This relation of
Electricity "& the relation
of temperature" elucidate each
other. -
- In cases of [underline]friction[/underline] Heat
is usually excited which by
changing the capacities of the

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00030|dnp02c330pp|88270723[/page]
acting Bodies unequally, may [insertion]sometimes[/insertion]
interfere [deletion]in the[/deletion] with
the exhibition of the different
electrical energies. -
- Warm rabbits fur rubbed
against cold glass renders
it negative; but cold
rabbits fur rubbed against
warm glass renders it
positive -
Rough glass is rendered
negative, Smooth glass positive
by the friction of Silk -
It is easy to conceive that
they may depend. - Upon the
[deletion]Rough[/deletion] glass being heated more
& the silk less in one
case than the other; &
similar explanations may
be given of those various
results of friction which
appear capricious & doubtful. -

- This principle of the changes of
Electrical Capacities of Bodies
is continually operating in the
Natural order of phaenomena.
- By the condensation of Vapour
in consequence of circumstances
which have been explained
in the lectures on Heat -
The particles of Water become
actively electrified - & by
a Law of Electricity which
will be fully discussed
hereafter - similarly electrified
Bodies repel each other;
& The spherules of Water
similarly electrified become
[underline]repulsive[/underline] to [underline]each[/underline] other (&
Clouds are formed - capable
of being moved by the winds
to places remote from those
where they had their
origin & capable of
affording | when their electricity

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00032|dnp02c332pp|88270725[/page]
is brought into Equilibrium dew,
or mist or rain. -
- Air whether rarified by Heat
or by mechanical causes becomes
to a certain extent a conductor;
& hence Clouds formed in cold
climates often give out their
electricity & [deletion]coolin[/deletion] desposit
their moisture in Hot
climates where the Air
is possessed of higher conducting
powers - & where [underline]Water[/underline] is
most needed to supply the
great evaporation. [deletion][unclear]&[/unclear][/deletion] to be
the support of [underline]Life[/underline]. -
- The phaenomena of the
Aurora Borealis [insertion]& Australis[/insertion] or Northern
 [insertion]& southern[/insertion] lights seems to depend on
the condensation of Vapour, by
cold of the polar regions
at the begining & during
the course of their winter.

[page]33|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00033|dnp02c333pp|88270726[/page]
- The ground being covered with
straw or the Sea with ice
which are perfect nonconductors
affords no passage to the
Electricity & it accumulates
in the strata of [deletion]Air[/deletion] [insertion]y[superscript]e[/superscript] Atmosphere[/insertion] (&
is carried off by the rare
Air in the higher regions
[deletion]of the Atmosphere[/deletion] - Hence
flashes, coruscations, & continued
streams of fire. -
- This is the Franklinian
idea some Philosophers
conceiving it to be too simple
have [deletion]given[/deletion] [insertion]advanced[/insertion] much more complicated
& [insertion]I may say much more[/insertion] obscure hypotheses [insertion]But it appears to me[/insertion] no strong
objection [insertion][deletion]it appears to me[/deletion][/insertion] can be urged to
the Theory; (& simplicity &
truth are [deletion]usually connected[/deletion] [insertion]by no means incompatible[/insertion].) -
- The electrical Energies of
bodies & the Changes of
Capacity seem to be the great

[page]34|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00034|dnp02c334pp|88270727[/page]
primary causes of the disturbance
of the Electrical equilibrium
 both in Nature & Art. -
(but there is another principle
of excitement [insertion]of great importance[/insertion] which may be
called [underline]secondary[/underline] or the
excitement by induction
& the Law with regard
to it is -
- That Bodies actively electrified
uniformly induce an [underline]opposite[/underline]
[underline]Electrical[/underline] [underline]state[/underline] on [insertion]other[/insertion] Bodies
in the Sphere of their activity.
& that if any [underline]Body[/underline], in a
system [underline]consisting of conductors[/underline]
& [underline]Nonconductors[/underline] be [underline]electrified[/underline]
positively. - the [underline]Body[/underline] [underline]nearest[/underline]
to it will be electrified
negatively, & [underline]vice versa[/underline]
-: The Cylinder of Nairnes
Machine is positive but the

[page]35|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00035|dnp02c335pp|88270728[/page]
end of the conductor nearest to
it is negative - the other end
is positive - & any Body
brought near this positive
end becomes negative; but
the Sparks restore the [underline]Equilibrium[/underline]. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- It is upon this circumstance
that the powers of the Leyden
Phial & Leyden Battery depend. -
-: By means of the prime
conductor the interior coating
becomes positively electrified -
The exterior negatively - as
Cond's
Noncond
much fluid as the one
receives; the other must give
out - & the two Electricities
come into equilibrium by
connecting the coatings -
Instance
The effects of the Electrophorus, the

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00036|dnp02c336pp|88270729[/page]
Doubler the multiplier & all analogous
instruments are of the same kind
one circumstance governs them
one Theory will apply to
them. -
On this principle combined
with the principle of [deletion]the[/deletion]
Electrical energy the [deletion]powerful[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]most obvious[/deletion][/insertion]
powers of the Apparatus
of Volta of the wonderful
Galvanic Battery principally
depend. -
* -: In the Voltaic Instrument
Copper & Zinc are arranged
in alternate pairs - & water
or solutions containing water
 are intermediate - Every
Zinc plate by its energy becomes
positive from contact every
Copper plate negative; but to
Electricities of such low
intensity according to a

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00037|dnp02c337pp|88270730[/page]
principle which has been before
explained - Water & aqueous
solutions are [insertion]almost[/insertion] insulating Bodies -
Every copper plate therefore increases
by induction the positive electricity
of the opposite Zinc plate &
every Zinc plate the [deletion][unclear]opposit[/unclear][/deletion]
negative Electricity of every
copper plate [deletion]&[/deletion]; the [deletion][unclear]quantity[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] intensity [deletion]of the Electricity[/deletion] [insertion]of the fluid[/insertion]
increases with the number
& [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] quantity [insertion][deletion]of the fluid[/deletion][/insertion] with the [deletion]size[/deletion]
[deletion]of the[/deletion] extent of Surface of the
plates; & When the extreme
parts are connected an
equilibrium is produced, which
as will be more distinctly
shewn hereafter is rapidly
destroyed by the chemical
alterations taking place in
the interior of the combination
so that a [underline]succession[/underline] of shocks of
[deletion]&[/deletion] sparks [deletion]may be [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] & of

[page]38|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00038|dnp02c338pp|88270731[/page]
other curious effects may be
continuously exhibited. - *
[underline]Instance[/underline]
-: The Law of induction is
of great [deletion]importanc[/deletion] interest in
its applications to [underline]atmospheric[/underline]
[underline]Electricity[/underline] - (A cloud
highly charged with Electricity
induces the opposite state
in the nearest surface of
the Earth or sea " - An
attraction takes place &
at a certain distance
the equilibrium is restored
with the awful phaenomena
of thunder & lightning
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- The cloud may sometimes
likewise [underline]induce[/underline] the opposite
electricity upon another
considerably smaller & a

[page]39|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00039|dnp02c339pp|88270732[/page]
20
discharge may take place between
them - or the Electricity
may be induced by one
cloud upon another & by
the second cloud upon the
Earth. -
- In the immense mass of
Vapours raised in Volcanic
explosions - the opposite state
is induced in all the
surrounding Atmosphere -
& the Heated Air being a
conductor - lightning appears
in all directions & particularly
from the circumference to
the center -
- In all cases in which
the Electrical equilibrium is
restored whether disturbed by
primary or secondary excitation

[page]40|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00040|dnp02c340pp|88270733[/page]
These phaenomena of Sound
Heat & Light are analogous.
- Sound is an undulation of
Air; & the explosion of
Electricity may be easily accounted
for from "the violent
expansion which it communicates
to the [underline]surrounding Air[/underline] - &
the continuous & varying noise
of Thunder is easily explained
from this circumstance - "that
Sound moves in sensible time
at the rate of 8 Miles in
a Minute - Whereas Electricity
appears to be infinitely rapid
in its motions - Where Lightning
has passed through a considerable
extent of the Atmosphere - We
hear the first sound in the
part of the Air which has been
[underline]agitated, that is nearest[/underline] to us

[page]41|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00041|dnp02c341pp|88270734[/page]
& we hear the sound last
from that part which is most
remote - & the swelling &
reiteration as it were, depends
upon the motion of the fluid
in jagged lines " by which
much more undulation is
excited in some parts than
in others. -
Instance
-: M[superscript]r[/superscript] Biot conceives "that the
Light & Heat of Lightning &
of the Discharge may be
owing to "the compression of
Air by y[superscript]e[/superscript] Electricity -" : But
this idea though very ingenious
[deletion]is evidently[/deletion] [insertion]may be shewn to be[/insertion] incorrect. -
- The Electrical Spark
Either from a Leyden Battery
or a Voltaic Battery is visible
in [underline]water[/underline] which is an incompressible
fluid - And charcoal I find

[page]42|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00042|dnp02c342pp|88270735[/page]
 may be ignited by Electricity ie
[deletion]in noncompressible fluid medium[/deletion].
[underline]under[/underline] water, Ether, or Spirit
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- M. Berthollet has concluded
from some late experiments "
"that the ignition of Metals
by Electricity whether artificially
or naturally excited depends
upon their oxidation upon
its diminishing their attraction
of cohesions - He founds
this idea upon the circumstance
that by a certain discharge
of a Battery which ignited
[underline]other[/underline] metals - [underline]platina[/underline]. [deletion]Lead[/deletion]
which did not [underline]combine with[/underline]
oxygene had its temperature
raised only to the boiling
point of water.

[page]43|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00043|dnp02c343pp|88270736[/page]
- I [underline]feel it impossible to assent[/underline] to
[underline]this opinion[/underline] " though proceeding
from [insertion]much[/insertion] [underline]high Authority[/underline]" - There
can be no doubt that [insertion]much[/insertion] Heat &
 Light are produced in certain
experiments by y[superscript]e[/superscript] combustion of the
metals " Then when [deletion]I connect[/deletion]
copper or gold leaf [insertion]are connected[/insertion] with the
two extremities of [deletion]thas[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] Battery
The vivid flash is owing
to combustion of the metal. -
[deletion]But the ignition takes[/deletion]
But there is ignition independent
of it which as I have often
witnessed takes place in a vacuoum
deprived of oxygene by Phosphorus. -
- And from M Berthollets fact
(if [insertion]even[/insertion] platina has its temp[superscript]e[/superscript]
raised to 212 by a [underline]certain[/underline]
discharge, by a [insertion]dis[/insertion]charge infinitely
higher it ought to be brought
to the state of ignition. -
& I find that by the Voltaic

[page]44|MS-DAVY-10243-000-00044|dnp02c344pp|88270737[/page]
Battery it is easily [deletion]ignited[/deletion] [insertion]heated to whiteness[/insertion] as
may be soon shewn. -
Instance
- Platina is the worst conductor
of Heat amongst the metals;
this may partly account for
the inferiority of effect produced
[insertion]upon it[/insertion] by discharges [deletion]upon[/deletion] - (probably
likewise it is the worst
metallic conductor of Electricity. -
- No [insertion]adequate[/insertion] mechanical or chemical
Solution of the problem can
be given - & I shall conclude
[insertion]this lecture[/insertion] by considering Heat & Light
as a [underline]pure result[/underline] of Electrical
action - (Wherefore they are
the result" - [deletion]will probably[/deletion]
is [deletion]one of the[/deletion] a mystery[deletion]s[/deletion] of
Science which will probably
[deletion]be one of the latest unfolded[/deletion]
is one of the last to be
unfolded. - There will always
be enigmas for us in Nature
& [underline]in philosophy[/underline], which will

Keep alive the faculty of research
& the active power of investigation. -
- [deletion]It our duty likewise to[/deletion]
[deletion]be guided by these [insertion]new[/insertion] lights[/deletion] which
[deletion]distinctly mark our path; &[/deletion]
[deletion]not in a wild spirit of adventure[/deletion]
[deletion]to wander in darkness;[/deletion] (& it
is much wiser to [underline]rejoice[/underline] "that
[underline]something[/underline] has been discovered
[deletion]&[/deletion] than to regret [underline]"that so[/underline]
[underline]much is[/underline] still [underline]concealed from[/underline]
us. -
