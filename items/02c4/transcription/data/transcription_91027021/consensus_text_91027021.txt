action, & elongates itself where it is thus
most excited, the radicle is stimulated by
moisture whence one of them grows upwards
in quest of its adapted object - & the
other downwards. - - -
- - To the notion "that the elevation of the
plume is owing to the vaporous nature of the
sap" It may be urged that there is not
the slightest reason to suppose that the sap is
vaporous - And that the phenomenon cannot
possibly depend upon the exciting powers of
Air & moisture - is shewn by a very simple
fact - When a seed is planted in firm
moist earth in the upper part of a cavity
made in a section of soil - or in soil inverted
& attached in a proper manner. - The plume
still makes its curvature & endeavours to
ascend - though the air acts upon it equally
below - |_ & the radicle leaves the moist earth
& exposes itself to the air in endeavouring to descend
This fact I have several times witnessed & the exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] may
be easily made with garden beans. -
Ins.[superscript]an[/superscript] Sketch
Here evidently the operating cause is connected with no vital
power, no instinctive property of the plant - for the root leaves the natural
source of its nourishment, & passes into a situation in which it can
obtain no food & wholly unfitted for the exercise of its functions
it obeys gravitation alone & however singular it may appear - M[superscript]r[/superscript]
