- This excellent experimenter placed seeds
of the Bean upon a wheel [deletion]arranged[/deletion] in
such a manner that it could
be made to perform a certain
number of revolutions which He
was able to regulate in a minute.
And He found that the beans grew
when the wheel was in rapid
motion & when the number of
revolutions was such that the
centrifugal force acting upon the
germ equalled the forces of
gravitation "the plumes &
the radicles took indifferently
any direction; but when the
centrifugal force considerably exceeded
gravity then all the plumes
directed themselves towards the
center of the wheel & the
radicles diverged perpendicularly
from the center.

Hence as the action of gravity
is in perpendicular lines towards
