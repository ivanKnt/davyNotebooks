Matters of the soil are imbibed
& they become the sap which
is continually ascending during
the expansion of the plant. -
- The principal fluid ingredient
in the soil is water but this
water to enable the vegetation
to be healthy & vigorous
must hold in solution as
I mentioned in the introductory
lecture various materials
Du Hamel attempted to raise Oaks
from acorns by means of water alone - The seed germinated
& an infant tree was produced - but it soon ceased
to make any progress & at length withered & died.
- - In the common exp[superscript]t[/superscript] which are so often made upon
our chimney pieces - of raising hyacinths from bulbs in
glass vessels filled with water - Unless the roots
are planted in the earth every other year -
they at last refuse to flower & even to
vegetate |_ & the new bulbs are infinitely
less vigorous than bulbs raised in a
proper soil. -
