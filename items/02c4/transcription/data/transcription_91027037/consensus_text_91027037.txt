of the carbonic acid which consists of
oxygene & charcoal & this process
he considers as a prime source of the
charcoal formed in plants. - -
- It hath not yet been proved
whether all the oxygene gas evolved
from plants is derived from the decomposition
of carbonic acid; - but the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
might be easily made - Carbonic acid gas
is heavier than oxygene gas in the
ratio of 46 to 34 - & oxygene in dissolving
charcoal in combustion scarcely alters
in volume. -
- If during the absorption of carbonic
acid by plants an equal or a
smaller volume of oxygene only is
evolved - the decomposition of the acid
may possibly be the sole process; but
if a larger volume is generated some
of it will most probably be derived
from the decomposition of water:
