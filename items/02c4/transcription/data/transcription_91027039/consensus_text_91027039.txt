submitted to the same trial - In
in this case after an equal time - Lime
water was immediately affected
in the vessel - Carbonic acid had been
formed. -
- It seems very contrary to analogy
& the general economy of things - that
a substance absorbed as nourishments
in the day should be evolved from the
same system of organs at night &
one purpose of Nature defeated by
another - & the explanation of the
dependence of the effect upon the
decay of parts of the plant is
neither insufficient nor contradicted
by facts. - - There are few plants
all the leaves of which are perfect - &
a single spot of decomposing matter
or even the agency of the dead matter
of the heart wood or the bark would
be fully adequate to the effect. -
