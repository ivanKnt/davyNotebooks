- - It is not possible to doubt that the
production of oxygene gas in consequence
of the living energies & chemical powers
of plants, is one of the sources of the
renovation of the atmosphere & the
equilibrium between its parts. -
- Animals absorb oxygene in the processes
of life & evolve carbonic acid - Vegetables
absorb carbonic acid & evolve oxygene: -
- In this instance as in a great variety of

of living things is connected - they are
mutually subservient. - -
- Carbonic acid from its great specific
gravity is continually tending to occupy
the lower part of the atmosphere. -
It is capable of being absorbed by water
is carried down by rain & attracted in its
fluid form by the roots - or in its elastic
state by the leaves of plants. - -
- Its accumulation in the atmosphere
