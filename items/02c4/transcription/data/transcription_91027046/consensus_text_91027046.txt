late in autumn it has been often
observed by Farmers that they never

purposes that kind of oak timber
afforded by trees that have had their
bark stripped off in the Spring & which
have been cut in the autumn or winter
following - The reason of the superiority of
this timber is that the concrete sap is
expended in the Spring in the sprouting
of the leaf & the circulation being destroyed
it is not formed anew & the wood
having its pores free from saccharine
matter is less liable to undergo fermentation
from the action of Moisture & air. -
