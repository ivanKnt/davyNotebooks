are annually produced & the nutriment
for the next year deposited in them - so
that the new buds (like the plume of
the seed) are supplied with a reservoir
of matter essential to their first develope=
=ment. The old alburnum is gradually
converted into heartwood & being constantly
pressed upon by the expansive force
of the new fibres, becomes harder
denser & at length loses altogether
its vascular structure - & in a certain
time obeys the common laws of dead
matter decays decomposes & is
converted into aeriform & carbonic
elements into those principles
from which it was originally formed. -
-- The decay of the heart wood
seems to constitute the great limit
to the age & size of trees - And in
young branches from old trees, it is
much more liable to decompose than
in similar branches from seedlings.
