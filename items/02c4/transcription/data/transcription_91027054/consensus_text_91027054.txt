[deletion]- In gardening in general this operation[/deletion]
[deletion]is only performed upon the varieties of the[/deletion]
[deletion]same species - but it will succeed even[/deletion]
[deletion]with different species in the same[/deletion]
[deletion]natural family - Thus the peach[/deletion]
[deletion]may be successfully engrafted upon[/deletion]
[deletion]the plum. - Their juices are alike &[/deletion]
they put forth the blossoms under similar
circumstances nearly in the same time. -
this is likewise the case with grafts
- The graft is only nourished by the sap
of the tree to which it is transferred -
its properties are not changed by it -
the leaves blossom & fruits are of the
same kind as if it had vegetated
upon its parent stock - The only
advantage to be gained in this way
is the affording of a graft from an
old tree a more plentiful & healthy
food than it could have procured
in its natural state - it is rendered
for a time more vigorous & produces
fairer blossoms & richer fruits -
