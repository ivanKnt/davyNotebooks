- - The apple is merely an improved
breed of our indigenous plant the
[underline]crass[/underline] - many of the principal

multiplied or in whatever soils

operation of Natural Causes. -
- We may produce new &
perhaps more excellent varieties
by means of seeds - but it is quite
impossible for us to preserve the
old ones. - - - -
