- For the series of changes, of expansions
of organs & of the productions of new
parts connected with the annual growth of trees
- it is evident that there must be a constant
supply of nutritive matter. - This inference
is clear. - A layer from the vine tree early
in spring will increase in less than a
month to double its original weight - It
consequently must consist of twice as much
living substance; - Its growth may be traced
almost by the eye; but the eye is wholly
inadequate to trace any of the processes
on which its expansion depends. - The

- For the germination of seeds - the
presence of a certain degree of heat of
water & air is necessary - & without
the concurrence of these agents they
are wholly incapable of sprouting. -
- The seed (it has been before stated)
consists of three parts the great mass
of it is formed by the organ of nourishment
which consists of one cotyledon or two
cotyledons of a radicle & a plumula
- When a seed is placed in contact

surrounded gradually swells & becomes
looser - Its cotyledons are enlarged in
their dimensions [deletion]& elastic fluid is given[/deletion]
[deletion]back from them[/deletion] - In this state the seed
is prepared for germination supplied
with heat & with moisture it requires
only atmospherical air to enable it to
evolve its infant organs. -
If a moistened seed be brought into
a portion of the atmosphere confined
in a proper vessel it is found that
at the time of sprouting a certain quantity
of pure air or of oxygene is absorbed
& that a little fixed air or carbonic acid
is given out by it. -

- In consequence of this operation a
new arrangement of the elements of the
mucilaginous & oily parts, (as I have

[page]4||dnp02c404pp|91027011[/page]
mentioned before) takes place - they
are rendered saccharine & the
moisture absorbed dissolves the sugar. -
- No germination takes place in vacuo
in carbonic acid inflammable air
or any of the airs that do not
contain free oxygene - this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
has been made with invariable
success by many physiologists. -

- The first distinct mark of perfect
germination is the development of
the radicle. - It may be distinctly
seen in the garden bean & in the
kidney bean in cases when they
have been exposed to the proper
circumstances. - In this stage of the
process if we examine the cotyledons
they are found to be considerably
enlarged & by means of a microscope

then connected with the base to which
are attached the radicle & the plumula.
Instance
The saccharine matter dissolved in the
fluid contained in the vessels of the
cotyledon where they are in this state
is carried into the plumula & by degrees
it causes it to expand & to rise toward
the atmosphere. -
- Acted upon by the solar rays the
bud of the plumula changes from
white to green & the cotyledons
receive a new form & when carried
into the atmosphere with the stem
are converted into seed leaves - At
this stage likewise the radicle is formed
into a root & the plant is developed
in a perfect organised form. -
[underline]Instances[/underline]
several nepel may be perceived in them connected with the base to which are attached the radicle for all the plumula Instance He sacchaine matter desiolved in the fluid contained in the nepel of the cotyledon where they are in this state is carried onto the plumula for all by degree it cames it to expand for all to rise torvaro the atmosphere.

This is called Tillering & one of the
great effects of Hoeing in the drill

- - When the moist earth is thrown round
the lower point of a stalk so as to

the following statement may be found,
"M[superscript]r[/superscript] C Miller of Cambridge sowed some
wheat on the 2[superscript]nd[/superscript] of June 1766 & on
the 8[superscript]th[/superscript] of August a plant was taken
& separated into 18 parts & replanted
these plants again were taken up &
divided in the months of Sept[superscript]r[/superscript]. & Oct[superscript]r[/superscript].
& planted separately to stand the
winter - which division produced
67 plants - They were again taken
up in March & April & produced
500 plants - the number of ears thus
formed from one grain of wheat
was 21109 - which gave 3 pecks
& 3 quarters of Corn that weighed

[page]11||dnp02c411pp|91027018[/page]
29
47 [superscript]lbs[/superscript] 7.[superscript]oz[/superscript] & that were estimated at 576840[superscript]grs[/superscript]
- - In wheat which has been sown
in the spring the same process of
germination takes place - but as there
is no accumulation of saccharine matter
in the plumula ready to produce
new organized parts - the grain is
seldom so fair & full - but though
a number of grains of spring wheat
will not weigh nearly so much as an
equal number of grains of winter wheat
yet the real quantity of nutritive matter
in [underline]equal[/underline] weight, seem to be greatest
in spring grain. - -
- At the request of Sir Jos[superscript]h[/superscript] Banks
I made an analysis of two specimens of
wheat - One of the finest & fullest of the
winter grain of 1804 - the other of the

[page]12||dnp02c412pp|91027019[/page]
spring grain. - - 100 parts of the
winter wheat gave 19 of gluten
about - 75 Starch
The spring wheat gave
24 gluten
68 of 9 Starch
And gluten is the most nutritive
part of the corn so that if it
should be found that spring wheat
is left liable to mildew than winter
wheat as Sir J. Banks seems inclined
to believe there will be little
disadvantage in the cultivation of it. -

- If during the germination of a seed
the radicle be pointed upwards &
the plume downwards - The new parts
in expanding will endeavour to
regain the original position & by
a great curvature the radicle
will turn itself towards the soil

& the plume towards the atmosphere. - -
Instance Sketch
The fact has been noticed by a great number
of veg.[superscript]e[/superscript] Physiologists & fully proved by the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of Du Hamel, J Bonnet & J. Hunter - |_ The
cause has been a subject of much discussion
& it is only within the last two years
that any first experiment illustrations of it
have been offered to the public. - -
- The opinion of de la Hire was "that the
vertical position of the plume depended
upon the ascent of the sap in the vaporous
form" & the direction of the roots to
the weight of the descending fluid - |_ D.[superscript]r[/superscript]
Hales seems to have formed nearly the same
opinion as to the effect being [underline]mechanical[/underline] -
but many other philosophers have referred
it to the peculiar vital powers of the plant. -
"It must depend" says [superscript]D.[/superscript] Darwin (always anxious
to make plants inferior animals) upon excitability
The plumula at is stimulated by the Air into

[page]14||dnp02c414pp|91027021[/page]
action, & elongates itself where it is thus
most excited, the radicle is stimulated by
moisture whence one of them grows upwards
in quest of its adapted object - & the
other downwards. - - -
- - To the notion "that the elevation of the
plume is owing to the vaporous nature of the
sap" It may be urged that there is not
the slightest reason to suppose that the sap is
vaporous - And that the phenomenon cannot
possibly depend upon the exciting powers of
Air & moisture - is shewn by a very simple
fact - When a seed is planted in firm
moist earth in the upper part of a cavity
made in a section of soil - or in soil inverted
& attached in a proper manner. - The plume
still makes its curvature & endeavours to
ascend - though the air acts upon it equally
below - |_ & the radicle leaves the moist earth
& exposes itself to the air in endeavouring to descend
This fact I have several times witnessed & the exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] may
be easily made with garden beans. -
Ins.[superscript]an[/superscript] Sketch
Here evidently the operating cause is connected with no vital
power, no instinctive property of the plant - for the root leaves the natural
source of its nourishment, & passes into a situation in which it can
obtain no food & wholly unfitted for the exercise of its functions
it obeys gravitation alone & however singular it may appear - M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Knights exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] seem to shew that the ascent of the plume is owing

[page]15||dnp02c415pp|91027022[/page]
31
to the same cause, - to this cause alone. -
- This excellent experimenter placed seeds
of the Bean upon a wheel [deletion]arranged[/deletion] in
such a manner that it could
be made to perform a certain
number of revolutions which He
was able to regulate in a minute.
And He found that the beans grew
when the wheel was in rapid
motion & when the number of
revolutions was such that the
centrifugal force acting upon the
germ equalled the forces of
gravitation "the plumes &
the radicles took indifferently
any direction; but when the
centrifugal force considerably exceeded
gravity then all the plumes
directed themselves towards the
center of the wheel & the
radicles diverged perpendicularly
from the center.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Hence as the action of gravity
is in perpendicular lines towards

tubular system filled with fluid
matter will in its expansion

The turnip fly an insect of the
Ceolyoptera genus [deletion]always[/deletion] fixes
itself [insertion]always[/insertion] when the seed leaves at

to perform their functions; &
when the plume is fully develloped
it is incapable of injuring the

[deletion]It has been a[/deletion] Several methods
have been proposed for destroying
the turnip fly or for preventing
its destructive tendancy - It has been

[page]20||dnp02c420pp|91027027[/page]
proposed to sow radishes with the
turnips on the idea that the
insect is fonder of the seed leaves
of the radish than those of
the Turnip; but this plan is
said to have been little
successful; & the fly does not 
seem to be such an epicure
as to make a nice selection
It exists in millions &
requires all the nourishment
that the two species can
afford together.
- There are several chemical
Menstrua which render the
process of germination much
more rapid, when the seeds
have been steeped in them
its in these cases the seed leaves
are [deletion]much more rapidly[/deletion] [insertion]quickly[/insertion] develloped
& more [deletion]rapidly[/deletion] [insertion]speedily[/insertion] perform their

subject of experiment on a former
occasion in this place to examine
whether such [underline]steeps[/underline] might not
be useful in raising the
turnips, more speedily to that
state in which it would be
secure from the fly; - But
the result proved that the
practice was inadmissible; for 
seeds so treated though they
germinate much quicker do not
produce healthy plants " & often
die soon after sprouting. -
I steeped radish seeds in Sept[superscript]r[/superscript] for 12 hours in
[deletion]this fluid[/deletion] [insertion]oxymuriatic acid[/insertion] & similar seeds in weak nitric acid, in
weak sulphuric acid - in weak solution of oxysulphate
of iron - & some in common water - The seeds in
oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript] acid & oxysul[superscript]e[/superscript] of Iron threw out the
germ in two days - those in nitric acid in 3 days
- in sulphuric acid in 5 - & those in water in
7 days - But in the cases of premature germination
though the plume was very vigorous for a short
time, yet it became at the end of a fortnight
weak & sickly & at that period less vigorous
in its growth than the sprouts which had been

[page]22||dnp02c422pp|91027029[/page]
naturally developed so that there can be
scarcely any [deletion]economical[/deletion] [insertion]useful[/insertion] application of these expr[superscript]ts[/superscript]
Too rapid growth & premature decay seem
invariably connected in organised structures
& it is only in following the slow operations of
natural causes that we are capable of making improvements. -
/_There are a number of chemical
substances which are very offensive
& even deadly to insects which
do no injure & some of
which even assist vegetation -
Sulphur has been tried in
various mixtures for the fly;
but the most efficacious compound
of the kind is Sulphur &
lime fused together & dissolved
in water; the fumes of this
is exceedingly noxious to all
animalcule & small insects;
& by the action of air it
is slowly converted into gypsum
so that it would rather
be a [unclear]native[/unclear] " than an
injurious application. -
Quicklime & urine as I mentioned

[page]23||dnp02c423pp|91027030[/page]
35
in former course of lectures would
probably likewise be a useful
compound. -
[deletion]And as the fly appears only[deletion]
[deletion]in dry and hot summers "watering[/deletion]
[deletion]would [insertion]probably[/insertion] be at once a[/deletion]
[deletion]simple & a rare method[/deletion]
[deletion]of directing its ravage, destroying[/deletion]
[deletion]it or of preventing its[/deletion]
[deletion]increase. -[/deletion]
- - After the plume & the radicle
have been fully formed a
new order of changes occurs
in the vegetable organs, the
saccharine matter of the seed
being expended the plant
now derives its nourishment
by its new & permanent organs
the roots & leaves
- By the capillary action
of [underline]the roots[/underline] the fluid

[page]24||dnp02c424pp|91027031[/page]
Matters of the soil are imbibed
& they become the sap which
is continually ascending during
the expansion of the plant. -
- The principal fluid ingredient
in the soil is water but this
water to enable the vegetation
to be healthy & vigorous
must hold in solution as
I mentioned in the introductory
lecture various materials
Du Hamel attempted to raise Oaks
from acorns by means of water alone - The seed germinated
& an infant tree was produced - but it soon ceased
to make any progress & at length withered & died.
- - In the common exp[superscript]t[/superscript] which are so often made upon
our chimney pieces - of raising hyacinths from bulbs in
glass vessels filled with water - Unless the roots
are planted in the earth every other year -
they at last refuse to flower & even to
vegetate |_ & the new bulbs are infinitely
less vigorous than bulbs raised in a
proper soil. -

- This plants all purified

the manure which was introduced
it consequently must have
entered into the living matter

-- All known facts prove the necessity
of the materials of the soil to the continued
processes of vegetation & there are numbers
of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] which shew that certain principles
contained in the atmosphere are likewise

[page]26||dnp02c426pp|91027033[/page]
essential to the growth of plants. -
Deprive a vegetable of air & it very
speedily dies - Boyle introduced various
plants in a state of healthy vegetation
under the receiver of his air pump -
he drew out the air & made an exhaustion -
The leaves in a few hours drooped & withered
& in less than 48 hours the process of
vegetation seemed perfectly at a stand. -
- In this case undoubtedly much of the
effect might be supposed to be mechanical -
the want of the usual pressure when the vessels
of the plant & the great effusion of
fluids & of elastic matter from them: -
- but a similar result takes place
though in a longer period if a plant
is confined in a small quantity of
common air - In this case it is soon
rendered sickly - the leaves decay
& it dies in a time which is so much
less in proportion as the volume of
elastic fluid to the bulk of the

[page]27||dnp02c427pp|91027034[/page]
37
plant is small. -
- I have often confined healthy sprigs of
mint in half pint bottles in which their
leaves were fully expanded - with sufficient
water & soil; but they generally died
in less than a week - They began to fade
usually in 3 or 4 days; & that there was
no other cause for their decay than a want
of some principle in the atmosphere was
evident from this circumstance - The
loosening the cork so as to admit of a
circulation of the surrounding elastic
fluid soon returned them to health when
they were beginning to wither. --
- - Air in its common state usually
contains a number of bodies mechanically
suspended in it - animal effluvia - dust
saline matter which have been raised by
winds or currents - It likewise holds water
in chemical solution - But its truly
elastic & almost invariable parts are
3 permanently aeriform fluids in a state

[page]28||dnp02c428pp|91027035[/page]
of intimate mixture Oxygene which
forms about 21 parts in the 100 Nitrogene
which forms 78 parts & carbonic acid gas
constituting only 1/800 - The carbonic acid
may be separated by lime or lime water
The oxygene by the combustion of phosphorus
or the oxydation of lead - The Nitrogene
remains free. -
- - When a plant is exposed in the full
sunshine in a vessel containing a
large quantity of air - It soon absorbs
the carbonic acid & it gives out a
little oxygene. -
- - The discovery of the absorption of
Carbonic acid by plants & the
emission of pure air was made
by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestly - & his Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] have
been successfully repeated by

have attended to the chemical
phenomena of vegetation

full healthy vegetation exert no absorbing
powers - on the oxygene & nitrogene of

elastic food they derive from the
atmosphere & M Sennebier found
that air perfectly deprived of this
principle was incapable of supporting
the life of vegetables
Instances -
- - D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Ingenhousz ascertained that the
leaves of plants when immersed in water
in the sunshine emitted globules of oxygene gas.
And M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Sennebier has demonstrated by very
accurate exp[superscript]ts[/superscripts] that this phenomena is
owing to a small quantity of Carbonic
acid dissolved in the water made use of. -
he found that in water deprived of carbonic acid
no oxygene appeared whilst the production
increased in proportion as the water was
more saturated. - he ascribes this effect
[deletion]to[/deletion] & the general effect of the production of
pure air from living plants to a decomposition

[page]30||dnp02c430pp|91027037[/page]
of the carbonic acid which consists of
oxygene & charcoal & this process
he considers as a prime source of the
charcoal formed in plants. - -
- It hath not yet been proved
whether all the oxygene gas evolved
from plants is derived from the decomposition
of carbonic acid; - but the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
might be easily made - Carbonic acid gas
is heavier than oxygene gas in the
ratio of 46 to 34 - & oxygene in dissolving
charcoal in combustion scarcely alters
in volume. -
- If during the absorption of carbonic
acid by plants an equal or a
smaller volume of oxygene only is
evolved - the decomposition of the acid
may possibly be the sole process; but
if a larger volume is generated some
of it will most probably be derived
from the decomposition of water:

[page]31||dnp02c431pp|91027038[/page]
39
& that both effects take place seems likely
from the nature of the inflammable
compounds formed in vegetation. - - -
- D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Ingenhouz ascertained that "plants
in darkness produce carbonic acid" & with
the absorption of oxygene" - & this effect
some philosophers have referred to peculiar
living functions of the leaves. - -
- From some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] I am however rather
inclined to believe that the carbonic acid
is produced by the death or decay of
some of the parts of the plant. - The
epidermis & the extreme filaments of the
leaves might easily occasion such a
phenomenon even in vegetables in health.
- A sprig of mint that had just
sprouted & having all its leaves
perfect was kept for 48 hours in
darkness in May [deletion]last[/deletion] [insertion]1806[/insertion] but no
carbonic acid was evolved - One of the
leaves was then bruised & it was

[page]32||dnp02c432pp|91027039[/page]
submitted to the same trial - In
in this case after an equal time - Lime
water was immediately affected
in the vessel - Carbonic acid had been
formed. -
- It seems very contrary to analogy
& the general economy of things - that
a substance absorbed as nourishments
in the day should be evolved from the
same system of organs at night &
one purpose of Nature defeated by
another - & the explanation of the
dependence of the effect upon the
decay of parts of the plant is
neither insufficient nor contradicted
by facts. - - There are few plants
all the leaves of which are perfect - &
a single spot of decomposing matter
or even the agency of the dead matter
of the heart wood or the bark would

- - It is not possible to doubt that the
production of oxygene gas in consequence
of the living energies & chemical powers
of plants, is one of the sources of the
renovation of the atmosphere & the
equilibrium between its parts. -
- Animals absorb oxygene in the processes
of life & evolve carbonic acid - Vegetables
absorb carbonic acid & evolve oxygene: -
- In this instance as in a great variety of
others the existence of the various species
of living things is connected - they are
mutually subservient. - -
- Carbonic acid from its great specific
gravity is continually tending to occupy
the lower part of the atmosphere. -
It is capable of being absorbed by water
is carried down by rain & attracted in its
fluid form by the roots - or in its elastic
state by the leaves of plants. - -
- Its accumulation in the atmosphere

which would be fatal to animal life
is thus prevented & to adopt the elegant
[otherwork_262]language of Sir Jn[superscript]o[/superscript]. Pringle[/otherwork_262] "From these
discoveries we are assured - that no
vegetable grows in vain - but that from
the oak of the forest - to the grass of the
field, every individual plant is serviceable
to mankind; if not always distinguished
by some private virtue yet making
a part of the whole which cleanses
& purifies our atmosphere - In this
the fragrant rose & deadly nightshade
co-operate nor is the herbage nor the
woods that flourish in the most remote
& unpeopled regions unprofitable to
us, nor we to them. Considering how
constantly the winds convey to them
our vitiated air, for our relief
& for their nourishment & if ever
these salutary gales rise to storms
& hurricanes, let us still trace
& revere the ways of a Beneficent

Being who not fortuitously but with
design - not in wrath but in mercy thus
shakes the water & the air together to
bury in the deep those putrid &
pestilential effluvia which the vegetables
upon the face of the earth had been
insufficient to consume". -
- From these facts of the
effects of the Atmosphere it
would seem that the
sap in rising upwards
[deletion]to[/deletion] receives coaly & infammable
matter, looses in the leaves
an immense quantity of its
aqueous particles & becomes
more fitted in descending
through the bark to produce
new matter -
*[superscript]xxx[/superscript] That the sap of the
Bark [insertion]affords the means for the[/insertion] [deletion]is most fitted for[/deletion]
[deletion]producing[/deletion] production of new parts

[page]36||dnp02c436pp|91027043[/page]
seems evident from a number
of experiments -
when the bark is stripped
from a surface of a
tree [underline]the new bark[/underline] always
forms in greatest quantities
at the upper surface of
the wound -
And D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hope of Edinburgh by
separating the bark from a
[underline]tree[/underline] & suffering the two
extremities to remain, found
after a certain time that new
wood filled up the
stripped Bark. -

in it by heat are deposited upon the sides
of the tubes now considerably diminished
in their diameter: & in consequence of this
deposition a nutritive matter is
provided for the first wants of the
plant in early Spring. - to assist the
opening of the buds & their expansion
when the motion from the want of leaves
is as yet feeble. - -
- This beautiful principle in the vegetable
economy was first pointed out by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Darwin
- & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight has given a number of experimen
-tal elucidations of it - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight made
numerous incisions into the alburnum [deletion]of[/deletion]
of the sycamore, & the birch at different
heights - & in examining the sap that flowed
from them he found it more sweet &
mucilaginous in proportion as the aperture
from which it flowed was elevated, which
he could ascribe to no other cause than to
its having dissolved sugar & mucilage which

[page]38||dnp02c438pp|91027045[/page]
had been stored up through the winter. - -
He exam[superscript]d[/superscript]. the alburnum in differsnt
poles of oak in the same forest, of which
some had been felled in winter & others
in summer - & he always found most
soluble matter in the wood felled
in winter & its spec: grav[superscript]y[/superscript]. was
likewise greater. -
- - In all perennial trees this
circumstance takes place - & in bulbous
roots likewise, which being too tender
in constitution to resist the cold of the
atmosphere are protected from its
influence by the imperfectly conducting
soil. - -
- In annual plants, the sap seems
to be fully exhausted of all its nutritive
matter by the production of seeds &
flowers; & no system exists by which
it can be preserved throughout the winter. - -
- When perennial grasses are

cropped very close by feeding of cattle
late in autumn it has been often
observed by Farmers that they never
rise vigorously in the Spring & this is
owing to the removal of that part
of the stalk which would have afforded
them concrete Sap - their first nourishments
- - Ship builders prefer for their
purposes that kind of oak timber
afforded by trees that have had their
bark stripped off in the Spring & which
have been cut in the autumn or winter
following - The reason of the superiority of
this timber is that the concrete sap is
expended in the Spring in the sprouting
of the leaf & the circulation being destroyed
it is not formed anew & the wood
having its pores free from saccharine
matter is less liable to undergo fermentation
from the action of Moisture & air. -
- In perennial [deletion]trees[/deletion] [insertion]plants[/insertion] a new alburnum
& consequently a new system of vessels

[page]40||dnp02c440pp|91027047[/page]
are annually produced & the nutriment
for the next year deposited in them - so
that the new buds (like the plume of
the seed) are supplied with a reservoir
of matter essential to their first develope=
=ment. The old alburnum is gradually
converted into heartwood & being constantly
pressed upon by the expansive force
of the new fibres, becomes harder
denser & at length loses altogether
its vascular structure - & in a certain
time obeys the common laws of dead
matter decays decomposes & is
converted into aeriform & carbonic
elements into those principles
from which it was originally formed. -
-- The decay of the heart wood
seems to constitute the great limit
to the age & size of trees - And in
young branches from old trees, it is
much more liable to decompose than
in similar branches from seedlings.

[deletion]- - The trees possessing the firmest & least[/deletion]
[deletion]porous heart wood are the longest in[/deletion]
[deletion]duration - Amongst our own tress need[/deletion]
[deletion]I say the oak stands pre-eminent &[/deletion]
[deletion]the Spanish chestnut comes very near[/deletion]
[deletion]to it for though less rigid in texture it[/deletion]
[deletion]is much less vascular - In our old[/deletion]
[deletion]Gothic buildings there has been some[/deletion]
[deletion]difficulty in distinguishing the Spanish[/deletion]
[deletion]Chestnut from the Oak - but they may[/deletion]
[deletion]be easily known by this circumstance[/deletion]
[deletion]The pores in the alburnum of the oak[/deletion]
[deletion]are much larger and thickly set & are[/deletion]
[deletion]easily distinguished by the unassisted eye[/deletion]
[deletion]- whilst the pores in the chesnut are[/deletion]
[deletion]with difficulty seen. -[/deletion]
[deletion]This sketch of a section of the two woods[/deletion]
[deletion]as seen considerably magnified will[/deletion]
[deletion]exhibit the difference[/deletion]
Instance. -
- - In consequence of the slow decay
of the heart wood of the oak & chesnut

[page]42||dnp02c442pp|91027049[/page]
these trees under favourable circumstances
attain an age which cannot be much
short of 1000 years. - - -
[deletion]- The beech, the ash & the sycamore[/deletion]
[deletion]most likely never live half so long -[/deletion]
[deletion]The duration of the apple tree is not[/deletion]
[deletion]probably much more than 200 years[/deletion]
[deletion]but the pear tree according to M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion]
[deletion][person_024]Knight[/person_024] lives double this period. -[/deletion]
[deletion]- - The Oak & chesnut decay much[/deletion]
[deletion]sooner in a moist situation than[/deletion]
[deletion]in a dry & sandy soil & their[/deletion]
[deletion]timber is less firm - - The sap[/deletion]
[deletion]vessels in such a case are more[/deletion]
[deletion]expanded, though less nourishing[/deletion]
[deletion]matter is carried into them - &[/deletion]
[deletion]the general texture of the formations[/deletion]
[deletion]of wood necessarily less firm -[/deletion]
[deletion]Such wood splits more easily & is[/deletion]

[deletion]- The same trees in general are much[/deletion]
[deletion]longer lived in the northern than in the[/deletion]
[deletion]southern climates - This circumstance[/deletion]
[deletion]has puzzled naturalists but the reason[/deletion]
[deletion]seems to be that all fermentation &[/deletion]
[deletion]decomposition are checked by cold & at[/deletion]
[deletion]very low temperatures both animal &[/deletion]
[deletion]vegetable matters resist altogether decay[/deletion]
[deletion]& putrefaction - And in the same[/deletion]
[deletion]climate Siberia where a Rhinoceros[/deletion]
[deletion]was found entire beneath the frozen soil[/deletion]
[deletion]in which it must have existed from the[/deletion]
[deletion]time of the deluge - it is easy to conceive[/deletion]
[deletion]that the wood of the fir & the oak[/deletion]
[deletion]must be imperishable in any period[/deletion]
[deletion]ascertainable by our records. -[/deletion]
[deletion]- Trees growing in situations much exposed[/deletion]
[deletion]to winds have harder & firmer wood[/deletion]
[deletion]than such as are considerably sheltered -[/deletion]
[deletion]the dense sap is determined by the agitation[/deletion]
[deletion]of the smaller branches to the trunk &[/deletion]
[deletion]large branches where the new[/deletion]

[page]44||dnp02c444pp|91027051[/page]
[deletion]alburnum formed is consequently[/deletion]
[deletion]thick & firm - Such trees abound in[/deletion]
[deletion]the crooked limbs forming knee timber[/deletion]
[deletion]which is necessary for joining the[/deletion]
[deletion]decks & the sides of ships -[/deletion]
[deletion]"The tortuous arms the Shipwrights'[/deletion]
[deletion]Darling treasure."[/deletion]
[deletion]- The gales in elevated situations[/deletion]
[deletion]gradually act so as to give the tree[/deletion]
[deletion]the form best calculated to resist[/deletion]
[deletion]their effects - And the mountain[/deletion]
[deletion]oak rises robust & sturdy fixed[/deletion]
[deletion]firmly in the soil & able to oppose[/deletion]
[deletion]the full force of the tempest. -[/deletion]
[deletion]- When the branch of a tree - of a[/deletion]
[deletion]tree in full vigour is cut off &[/deletion]
[deletion]placed in the ground in such a[/deletion]
[deletion]way that some of its incipient buds[/deletion]
[deletion]or germens are covered by moist soil[/deletion]
[deletion]it almost always throws out radicles[/deletion]
[deletion]which become roots & if the proper[/deletion]
[deletion]season is selected this mode of[/deletion]

[deletion][deletion]by cutting[/deletion] is very [deletion]essential[/deletion] [insertion]applicable[/insertion]. -[/deletion]
[deletion]- But instead of being planted in the[/deletion]
[deletion]ground the branch may be transferred to[/deletion]
[deletion]another tree - from which a similar[/deletion]
[deletion]branch has been removed - & by adapting[/deletion]
[deletion]the incisions & defending them from the[/deletion]
[deletion]action of the air by a cement of clay[/deletion]
[deletion]or other adhesive substance a union[/deletion]
[deletion]will take place & if the proper[/deletion]
[deletion]circumstances are observed the branch[/deletion]
[deletion]will grow vigorously in its new situation[/deletion]
[deletion]will become as it were parasitical &[/deletion]
[deletion]be supported by the sap of the stock[/deletion]
[deletion]on which it is fixed. - [deletion]Graft[/deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]examined found to communicate with[/deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]the common tubes[/deletion]. - - - -[/deletion]
[deletion]- In the adherence of the graft to[/deletion]
[deletion]the tree, there is merely an inosculation[/deletion]
[deletion]of the fibres of the new alburnum &[/deletion]
[deletion]barks & the communication of the sap is[/deletion]
[deletion]through the common tubes & the porous[/deletion]
[deletion]tubes, which being so generally diffused[/deletion]

[page]46||dnp02c446pp|91027053[/page]
[deletion]must necessarily correspond in many[/deletion]
[deletion]parts - D[superscript]r[/superscript] Darwin supposes in the[/deletion]
[deletion]"Phytologia" "that the engrafted bud[/deletion]
[deletion]sends down its own fibrils as radicles[/deletion]
[deletion]to the soil " - but M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight has[/deletion]
[deletion]shewn that this cannot happen &[/deletion]
[deletion]the line between the old wood & the[/deletion]
[deletion]engrafted wood is always marked[/deletion]
[deletion]& the new wood of the graft never[/deletion]
[deletion]spreads downwards beyond the point[/deletion]
[deletion]of original junction . - - - -[/deletion]
[deletion]- - Ingrafting can [insertion]be[/insertion] only successfully[/deletion]
[deletion]performed upon trees the ascending[/deletion]
[deletion]& descending sap of which are[/deletion]
[deletion]respectively similar - Du Hamel[/deletion]
[deletion]found that branches of the pear[/deletion]
[deletion]the apple - the plum & the peach[/deletion]
[deletion]speedily died when attached to the[/deletion]
[deletion]the oak the elm & other forest trees:-[/deletion]
[deletion]but the juices of the bark & the[/deletion]
[deletion]alburnum are different & their[/deletion]
[deletion]habits with regard to germination[/deletion]
[deletion]& blossoming altogether unlike. -[/deletion]

[page]47||dnp02c447pp|91027054[/page]
47
[deletion]- In gardening in general this operation[/deletion]
[deletion]is only performed upon the varieties of the[/deletion]
[deletion]same species - but it will succeed even[/deletion]
[deletion]with different species in the same[/deletion]
[deletion]natural family - Thus the peach[/deletion]
[deletion]may be successfully engrafted upon[/deletion]
[deletion]the plum. - Their juices are alike &[/deletion]
they put forth the blossoms under similar
circumstances nearly in the same time. -
this is likewise the case with grafts
- The graft is only nourished by the sap
of the tree to which it is transferred -
its properties are not changed by it -
the leaves blossom & fruits are of the
same kind as if it had vegetated
upon its parent stock - The only
advantage to be gained in this way
is the affording of a graft from an
old tree a more plentiful & healthy
food than it could have procured
in its natural state - it is rendered
for a time more vigorous & produces
fairer blossoms & richer fruits -

[page]48||dnp02c448pp|91027055[/page]
[deletion]- - Many ridiculous ideas formerly[/deletion]
[deletion]prevailed amongst gardeners on the[/deletion]
[deletion]subject of change by engrafting -[/deletion]
[deletion]It has been supposed that mixed[/deletion]
[deletion]fruits would be procured in this way[/deletion]
[deletion]& though L[superscript]d[/superscript] Bacon with that strength[/deletion]
[deletion]of reason & sagacity of observation which[/deletion]
[deletion]so peculiarly belong to him denied[/deletion]
[deletion]the possibility of such a circumstance -[/deletion]
[deletion]yet the idea has been lately revived[/deletion]
[deletion]- Thus in the first V[superscript]o[/superscript] of the Com[superscript]n[/superscript] to the[/deletion]
[deletion]B A M[superscript]r[/superscript] Jay states "that there is[/deletion]
[deletion]an apple existing at New York sweet[/deletion]
[deletion]on one side & sour on the other produced[/deletion]
[deletion]by grafting two slit scions - one from[/deletion]
[deletion]a tree yielding sweet fruit - the other[/deletion]
[deletion]from a tree yielding sour fruit on[/deletion]
[deletion]the same stock" & I have heard[/deletion]
[deletion]the warm & bitter qualities of[/deletion]
[deletion]some cherries steeped in brandy[/deletion]
[deletion]ascribed to them having been[/deletion]
[deletion]produced from a graft on a[/deletion]
[deletion]laurel tree. -[/deletion]

[deletion]- - Such alterations are impossible the[/deletion]

[deletion]the graft" & the graft[/deletion] [insertion]but it[/insertion] partakes not
merely the obvious properties, but
likewise the infirmities, dispositions
to old age & decay of the tree whence
it sprung - This seems to be distinctly
shewn by the observations & exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight
- he has in a number of instances transferred
the young scions & healthy shoots from
old esteemed fruit bearing trees to young
seedlings - They flourished for 2 or 3 years
but they soon became diseased & sickly
like their parent trees. -
-  - it is from this cause that so many
of the apples formerly celebrated for their
taste & their uses in the manufacture
of cyder are gradually deteriorating &
many will soon disappear - The golden
pippin - the red streak & the moil so
excellent at the beginning of the last

[page]50||dnp02c450pp|91027057[/page]
century are now on the extremest
stage of their decay & however
carefully they are ingrafted they
merely tend to multiply a sickly
& worn out species. -
- - The apple is merely an improved
breed of our indigenous plant the
[underline]crass[/underline] - many of the principal
varieties of these which we now
possess appear to have been
introduced about the time of
Henry the 8[superscript]th[/superscript] & such have
nearly lived their time & however
multiplied or in whatever soils
will yield to the general
operation of Natural Causes. -
- We may produce new &
perhaps more excellent varieties
by means of seeds - but it is quite
impossible for us to preserve the
old ones. - - - -
