Lecture 1. Introductory
to Electro Chemical Science
March 12.[superscript]th[/superscript] 1808
-- It affords me the most sincere pleasure to
be able to appear again before you. - There is
no desire more alive & ardent in my mind than
that of having it in my power to combine
experiments made for the advancement of Science
with the details of public lectures. ---
-- The present course admits of such an union
& I shall consider my exertions & labour in
delivering it as more than compensated for
by the satisfaction I shall receive if the end
to which my wishes are so strongly directed be
in any manner accomplished. --
-- I speak of labour & exertion not with
the view of making a parade of difficulties &
of the merit of overcoming them but merely
to prepare for & to ask you to consider with
indulgence what I am convinced will be a
very imperfect work. ---
-- The subject you will feel is in a great
measure unexplored. - Little or no assistance
in the investigation can be derived from Books
