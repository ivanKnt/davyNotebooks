& I am obliged to trust almost wholly, to
my own efforts & my own limited information
Had I been able to make my preparations in
full health & in full time, I should have
possessed more confidence; & the novelty
& importance of the subject would have been
sources rather of hope than of fear; but
the long confinement & severe illness which
I have sustained have prevented me from
maturely arranging my plans. Many ideas
in full vividness before, I am unable at
this moment to recover & investigations have
been left incomplete which I had hoped
to be able now to bring before you, & to
connect with some brilliant results You
must regard this attempt, as an unfinished
building of which the scaffolding has failed
& demands repair; unfinished, but not
neglected to be an object of future care
& labour, unfinished not from a want
of will in the Architect to pursue
his object; but from a want of power.--
