according as they are contradictory or comformable
to new discoveries. -
- I trust I shall be guided throughout
the whole progress of enquiry by these principles
 of research - |_ And in [deletion]employing[/deletion] [insertion]employing[/insertion] them; |_ the first
subject for discussion will be that which most
applies & which is most nearly related to
the whole series of phenomena The subject
of Electrical Attraction & Repulsion. -
- Certain bodies when heated or rubbed
draw to them very light substances such as
sealing wax or glass, which when thus
excited attract feathers, bits of paper or
Gold leaf; - This is remarkable but it is
more remarkable that a light substance
placed in a condition to be attracted by
heated glass is driven away or repelled
by heated sealing wax. -
- It is on facts of this kind which
may be almost infinitely multiplied - that
the idea of positive & negative Electricity
has been established - It will not be
necessary for us to discuss the remote cause
