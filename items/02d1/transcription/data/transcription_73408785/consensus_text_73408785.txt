- Thus water thrown upon a red hot plate
of Silver is expanded to many hundred times
its former volume; & it rendered the silver
negative - But steam thrown upon a [underline]cold[/underline]
plate of Silver so as to be condensed into water
makes it positive -
- In considering the common & artificial
phaenomena of electricity we shall often have
occasion to recur to the principle of the changes
of chemical capacity; |_For in processes of friction
the heat produced often alters the [underline]capacities[/underline]
of the acting substances unequally, & hence
modifies the results which would arise from
the pure exhibition of their electrical energies -
|_ In natural phaenomena this law of capacity
acts a still more important part. -
- By Evaporation, from the diffusion of water
in air, the surface is rendered negative &
by the condensation of moisture in the upper
regions of the Atmosphere its strata become
positive, & water being a conducting substance
clouds are changed, & in returning their contents
to the sources whence they sprang; they
