-- |_ These facts of electrical excitement are
[underline]primary[/underline]; but there are others which though
secondary will require an attentive inves-

- - - Different Bodies possess very
different powers with regard to electrical
transfer or communication -- some are said
to be perfect conductors, such as metals
that is to say the electrical influence
rapidly pervades their parts, others are
imperfect conductors which as it were
[underline]expose obstacles[/underline] to its passage, such is water
which according to M[superscript][underline]r[/underline][/superscript] Cavendish's
computation conducts 400. 000, 000 less
perfectly than Iron. - -  Others again
are non conductors such as [underline]glass[/underline], being
impermeable to Electricity. - - - |_ Even
amongst conductors, there are great
differences in their relations to the
different states of electrical excitement,
thus some conduct negative electricity only
