as soap, & others positive Electricity only as the
flame of a candle. |_& these remarkable powers
established by the late researches of Erman
will be found to lead to important conclusions
& in some measure to connect the mechanical
& chemical properties of matter.
- A Body positively electrified rendered
another Body in its vicinity negative &
[underline]vice versa. A Body negatively electrified[/underline]
renders some contiguous body positive. |_& if
the Electricities are exalted a discharge results.
This is the fact of [underline]induction[/underline], of which a
number of elucidations will be offered to you.-
- It is on this principle that the transfer
of electricity in the common electrical machine
from the Glass, to the conductor, is performed.-
& on this depends the operation of the Leyden
jar & the battery by which an immense
accumulation of Electricity is produced &
some of the great effects in Nature imitated.-

the effects of lightning and upon the principle
of being induced into an opposite state from
