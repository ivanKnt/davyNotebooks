- Bodies possessed of similar electrical
energies according to the common laws of
electrical attraction & repulsion ought
to repel each other - Bodies possessed
of different electrical energies ought to
attract each other. - |_The question may be
asked then? - is not what has been always
called chemical affinity merely the
union or coalescence, of particles naturally
in opposite electrical states? - & are
not the chemical attraction of particles
& the [underline]electrical[/underline] attractions of masses
owing to one property & governed by
one simple law. - - -.
- - There are extensive series of
phaenomena which favour this idea
& as yet no contradictory fact has
occurred [deletion]to me[/deletion] [underline]& the[/underline] Electrical &
[underline]chemical functions of[/underline] Bodies as far
as our knowledge extends - exist only
together & are modified, created,
or destroyed at the same time. - -
