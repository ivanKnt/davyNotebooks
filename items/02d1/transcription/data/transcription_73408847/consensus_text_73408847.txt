- Thus a metal is naturally positive with
regard to oxygen, when this its electricity
is increased it combines with oxygene, with
more facility; but if it is made negative
it refuses to combine or remain in union -
& repulsion instead of attraction takes place. -
-Acids in general again are negative,
Alkalies, earths & metallic oxides positive; -
& as is well known they unite to form
new compounds; - But if an acid be
made positive by artificial means, it refuses
to combine with alkalies or if alkalies be
made negative, they will no longer act upon
acids;. & by employing different electricities,)
[underline]in consequence[/underline] of [underline]these effects neutral[/underline] salts &
an immense number of [underline]other compounds[/underline] [underline]may[/underline]
be [underline]decomposed[/underline] & their elements obtained.-
