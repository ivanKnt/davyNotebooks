matter capable of supporting combustion are
naturally negative ; & where [underline]the two electrical[/underline]
powers are artificially exhibited in the
same system of Bodies, oxygene & such
substances as contain oxygene in excess, are
uniformly brought into a state of rest in
the sphere of positive electricity; & hydrogene,
Sulphur, Phosphorus, metals in short
combustible bodies in general are repelled
from the sphere of positive electricity &
attracted into that of negative Electricity.
|_ Metallic oxides, earths & alkalies are
all positive & are attracted by negatively
electrified surfaces - |_but metallic oxides
consist of a large portion of different in=
=flammable matters combined with a small
proportion of oxygene; - Analogy induced
me to believe that the alkalies & earths
were similar compounds; & experiments
as far as they have gone, have converted
this conjecture into a truth. ----
