-- The lectures will be concluded
with an outline of the History of
the Science - In this I shall have
an opportunity of recapitulating
the principal facts of the course -
of referring them to their inventors
& of considering them in their relations
to human talent & ingenuity. ---
[marginal note]Little space -[/marginal note] Such is the plan which I shall

the information which I shall lay before
you -- |_Having developed [underline]my objects[/underline]
it will be improper for me, to say much
of the [underline]advantages[/underline] that may be derived
from this kind of study - You must
already have weighed them & it is
not my wish to [underline]entice[/underline] you to follow
the course, for I should constantly
dread the uneasy feeling of disappointing
you. - - - - -
