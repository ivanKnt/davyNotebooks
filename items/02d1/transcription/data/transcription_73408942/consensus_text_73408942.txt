- - Literature & the refined Arts though
most noble in their general effects may be
misapplied. - Natural Science on the
contrary being an exhibition of the powers
existing in the Universe of things cannot
be subservient to the passions, prejudices,
or vices of Men. - As far as it influences
the mind it must correct all evil tendencies
& having a sublime origin in philosophical
minds it descends even to the most familiar
offices & is subservient to common purposes.-
Like a stream rising amongst mountains, it
flows from the heavens to the earth - & though
in its begin[deletion]n[/deletion]ings it is known only to a
few, its benefits gradually extend, &
it at length adorns & fertilizes an
extensive & populous district. - - -
