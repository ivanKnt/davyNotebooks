Lecture 1. Introductory
to Electro Chemical Science
March 12.[superscript]th[/superscript] 1808
-- It affords me the most sincere pleasure to
be able to appear again before you. - There is
no desire more alive & ardent in my mind than
that of having it in my power to combine
experiments made for the advancement of Science
with the details of public lectures. ---
-- The present course admits of such an union
& I shall consider my exertions & labour in
delivering it as more than compensated for
by the satisfaction I shall receive if the end
to which my wishes are so strongly directed be
in any manner accomplished. --
-- I speak of labour & exertion not with
the view of making a parade of difficulties &
of the merit of overcoming them but merely
to prepare for & to ask you to consider with
indulgence what I am convinced will be a
very imperfect work. ---
-- The subject you will feel is in a great
measure unexplored. - Little or no assistance
in the investigation can be derived from Books

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00002|dnp02d102pp|73408723[/page]
& I am obliged to trust almost wholly, to
my own efforts & my own limited information
Had I been able to make my preparations in
full health & in full time, I should have
possessed more confidence; & the novelty
& importance of the subject would have been
sources rather of hope than of fear; but
the long confinement & severe illness which
I have sustained have prevented me from
maturely arranging my plans. Many ideas
in full vividness before, I am unable at
this moment to recover & investigations have
been left incomplete which I had hoped
to be able now to bring before you, & to
connect with some brilliant results |_ You
must regard this attempt, as an unfinished
building of which the scaffolding has failed
& demands repair; unfinished, but not
neglected to be an object of future care
& labour, unfinished not from a want
of will in the Architect to pursue
his object; but from a want of power.--

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00003|dnp02d103pp|73408726[/page]
-- Electro-chemical Science relates to all
the phenomena in which electrical agencies
are concerned. -- It may be asked why
has this new term been adopted? I trust
not without good reasons - [underline]Electricity[/underline] or
Electrical Science has been always applied to
a particular series of brilliant yet insulated
effects in which chemical changes had
no share -- The word [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person] has
likewise always been understood in a
limited sense & it could not with propriety
be made to include a general view of
corpuscular philosophy & perhaps the
name of [person]person_269|Galvani[/person] has been already too
often associated with the later philosophical
truths. This observer was indeed the fortunate
& accidental discoverer of a most important
fact, but He mistook the interpretation &
pursued it to no extent. And it is to
the penetrating Genius of [person]person_199|[underline]Volta[/underline][/person] that we
owe the most happy elucidations & powerful
instruments of the Science; but even the

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00004|dnp02d104pp|73408734[/page]
name of [misc]misc_228|[underline]Voltaism[/underline][/misc] could not be used
with strict philosophical justice for his
discoveries comprehended electrical phenomena
alone, & the most important results which
have been since ascertained are chemical
& connected with the general system of
operations in Art & in Nature. -
-- In so extensive a field of investigation
a general view of the objects of discussion,
of their order, connections & applications
cannot be improper - It will be tedious
but it is necessary |_& to all who may
follow the course not merely from curiosity
or the hope of being amused - but from
the genuine love of knowledge I am
convinced it will be useful. -
Amidst the numerous subjects of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript].
you will find many that have been
before introduced to you; yet the
most interesting will be of a novel
character : - You will find that
something has been accomplished which

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00005|dnp02d105pp|73408746[/page]

5I had ventured to hope for even within the
short period that has elapsed since I last
had the honour of addressing you - And
it may be a source of gratification to know
that this branch of Knowledge which you
attended to & fostered even in its infant
state whilst helpless in [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] cradle has
rapidly increased in strength & power, &
has advanced, if not to the full form &
vigour of Manhood, at least to the
freshness & promise of Youth. -
- Amidst the multifarious phenomenae
of the external World, an immense number
of similarities or analogies appear to the
investigating mind - To arrange them &
to discover new ones by more minute observations,
or experimental means is a principal business
of Philosophy, & the legitimate practise that
sanctioned by the precepts of [person]person_124|Bacon[/person] & the
example of [person]person_036|Newton[/person] is to proceed from particular
instances to general ones & to found Hypotheses
upon facts to be rejected or adopted
Amidst the multifarious phenomena
has advanced, if not to the full form &
rapidly increased in strength & power, &
state whilst helpless in its cradle had
attended to & fostered even in its infant
that this branch of Knowledge which you
it may be a source of gratification to know
had the honour of addressing youâ€”And
short period that has elapsed since I last

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00006|dnp02d106pp|73408757[/page]
according as they are contradictory or comformable
to new discoveries. -
- I trust I shall be guided throughout
the whole progress of enquiry by these principles
 of research - |_ And in [deletion]employing[/deletion] [insertion]employing[/insertion] them; |_ the first
subject for discussion will be that which most
applies & which is most nearly related to
the whole series of phenomena The subject
of Electrical Attraction & Repulsion. -
- Certain bodies when heated or rubbed
draw to them very light substances such as
sealing wax or glass, which when thus
excited attract feathers, bits of paper or
Gold leaf; - This is remarkable but it is
more remarkable that a light substance
placed in a condition to be attracted by
heated glass is driven away or repelled
by heated sealing wax. -
- It is on facts of this kind which
may be almost infinitely multiplied - that
the idea of positive & negative Electricity
has been established - It will not be
necessary for us to discuss the remote cause

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00007|dnp02d107pp|73408762[/page]
of the phaenomenon - Whether the attractions
depend upon one very subtle fluid existing in
the pores of all common bodies in larger or
smaller quantities; or upon two etherial fluids
capable as it were of neutralizing each other
by combination, will be objects of enquiry for
a more enlightened & distant period of the
Science which as yet is too immature to
admit of generalizations even less refined
- - The difference in the [underline]electrical[/underline] states of
different Bodies, occasioned by [underline]Heat[/underline] or friction
has long been known. - |_But that bodies existed
naturally negative & positive with regard to
each other, independent of any mechanical or
[underline]late discovery.[/underline]-
A piece of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & a piece of [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] when made
to touch each other "& separated are [insertion]found[/insertion] by
delicate tests the one negative the other positive
A plate of glass made to touch a surface of
[chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical] is found positive & the [chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical]
negative. -
- - An immense number of similar instances
exist. Whenever adequate means of investigation

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00008|dnp02d108pp|73408765[/page]
have been employed, the phenomenon has
been observed, & it seems to apply to all
[underline]bodies differing in[/underline] nature & constitution. - - -
- - The developement" of the Law & the
illustration of it by experiments must occupy
much of our attention [underline]from[/underline] the importance
of it in principle [underline]& from the[/underline] extent of its
[underline]applications[/underline] ,& it will be found to offer
explanations of a number of effects hitherto
insulated or obscure. - - - -
- - In the operation of common Electrical
Machines the Electrical fluid has been
generally conceived as pressed out of the
glass by the influence of friction |_The
theory, on the principle of natural electrical
energy, will certainly be less complicated
& mechanical. - |_ Friction will be considered
merely as a succession of contacts more
effectually exhibiting what may be shewn
even by a single contact, the natural
positive [underline]state of glass[/underline] [underline]with regard[/underline] [underline]to the[/underline]
[underline]metallic amalgams[/underline] or [underline][misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] of the cushion[/underline].

- A plate of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & a plate of Silver brought
in contact with each other & applied to the
tongue produce a strong caustic sensation - |_ [underline]This[/underline]
[underline]the experiment of [person]person_325|Sulzer[/person]; & the analogous[/underline] exp[superscript]t[/superscript]..
of [person]person_269|Galvani[/person] on the excitation of the muscles of
animals, which for so long a time were supposed
to be demonstrative of new [underline]recondite[/underline] principles
intimately connected [underline]with vitality in organic[/underline]
bodies, may be solved in the most perfect
manner, according to the new elucidations, [underline]as[/underline]
simple facts of common electrical action. -
- - In the grand arrangements of Nature with
every alteration of place, with every new contact
of Bodies, electrical effects must necessarily be
connected, which require to be considered in
examining the general laws of the changes & trans =
= mutations of matter. - The materials of the
air, of the solid surface, & of the Ocean differ
in electrical energy - |_With all their mechanical
movements in respect to each other there must
be a disturbance of the electrical equilibrium
& on this idea may be explained [deletion]most[/deletion] [insertion]many[/insertion] of the

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00010|dnp02d110pp|73408775[/page]
exhibitions of electrical effects constantly
taking place in Nature which under common
circumstances proceeding slowly & gradually,
are connected with the daily & uniform
order of events; but which in other cases
appear to be the immediate or remote
causes of remarkable & awful phaenomena,
& associated with the whirlwind, the
hurricanes & the earthquake. - - -
- - Excitation by contact seems to be [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]a great[/insertion] cause of the common phaenomena of
electrical attraction & repulsion, [underline]but there[/underline]
is [underline]another cause[/underline], in what is called the
alteration of the electrical capacity of Bodies
in consequence of alterations in their [underline]specific[/underline]
forms or composition . - |_ [underline]Bodies[/underline] expanding
enlarging in their [underline]dimensions[/underline] from the influence
of [underline]heat[/underline], become negative, - Bodies contracting,
suffering a diminution of volume by [underline]cooling[/underline]
on the contrary are [underline]positive[/underline] [underline]& as it were[/underline]
[underline]communicate[/underline] [underline]electricity[/underline] to the surrounding
bodies, whatever may be their natural
energies. - -

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00011|dnp02d111pp|73408785[/page]
- Thus water thrown upon a red hot plate
of Silver is expanded to many hundred times
its former volume; & it rendered the silver
negative - But steam thrown upon a [underline]cold[/underline]
plate of Silver so as to be condensed into water
makes it positive -
- In considering the common & artificial
phaenomena of electricity we shall often have
occasion to recur to the principle of the changes
of chemical capacity; |_For in processes of friction
the heat produced often alters the [underline]capacities[/underline]
of the acting substances unequally, & hence
modifies the results which would arise from
the pure exhibition of their electrical energies -
|_ In natural phaenomena this law of capacity
acts a still more important part. -
- By Evaporation, from the diffusion of water
in air, the surface is rendered negative &
by the condensation of moisture in the upper
regions of the Atmosphere its strata become
positive, & water being a conducting substance
clouds are changed, & in returning their contents
to the sources whence they sprang; they

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00012|dnp02d112pp|73408798[/page]
moisten the earth in Rain, dew, or mist
& occasion lightning & thunder. - - -
-- |_ These facts of electrical excitement are
[underline]primary[/underline]; but there are others which though
secondary will require an attentive inves-
-tigation those connected with what is
called [underline]propogated[/underline] & [underline]induced[/underline] [underline]Electricity[/underline]. - -
- - - Different Bodies possess very
different powers with regard to electrical
transfer or communication -- some are said
to be perfect conductors, such as metals
that is to say the electrical influence
rapidly pervades their parts, others are
imperfect conductors which as it were
[underline]expose obstacles[/underline] to its passage, such is water
which according to [person]person_026|M[superscript][underline]r[/underline][/superscript] Cavendish's[/person]
computation conducts 400. 000, 000 less
perfectly than Iron. - -  Others again
are non conductors such as [underline]glass[/underline], being
impermeable to Electricity. - - - |_ Even
amongst conductors, there are great
differences in their relations to the
different states of electrical excitement,
thus some conduct negative electricity only

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00013|dnp02d113pp|73408805[/page]

as soap, & others positive Electricity only as the
flame of a candle. |_& these remarkable powers
established by the late researches of [person]person_317|Erman[/person]
will be found to lead to important conclusions
& in some measure to connect the mechanical
& chemical properties of matter.
- A Body positively electrified rendered
another Body in its vicinity negative &
[underline]vice versa. A Body negatively electrified[/underline]
renders some contiguous body positive. |_& if
the Electricities are exalted a discharge results.
This is the fact of [underline]induction[/underline], of which a
number of elucidations will be offered to you.-
- It is on this principle that the transfer
of electricity in the common electrical machine
from the Glass, to the conductor, is performed.-
& on this depends the operation of the [misc]misc_130|Leyden[line]jar[/misc] & the battery by which an immense
accumulation of Electricity is produced &
some of the great effects in Nature imitated.-
|_ - Conductors for preserving buildings from
the effects of lightning and upon the principle
of being induced into an opposite state from

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00014|dnp02d114pp|73408807[/page]
that of the cloud or the atmosphere &
presenting points only they occasion &
slow discharge of [underline]Electricity[/underline] & disperse
this [underline]active[/underline] & often [underline]terrible[/underline] agent in
harmless & beautiful flashes. - - -
- - Clouds when charged with negative
electricity induce positive Electricity upon
other clouds in their neighbourhood. -
& these again occasion the opposite state
in some other contiguous matter; & hence
by an alternation of circumstances &
a communication with the surface of the
earth the equilibrium is gradually restored. -
- - |_ It is in the law of induction combined
with the general property of electrical
energy, that the powers of the most
wonderful & important [insertion]electrical[/insertion] instrument
ever discovered depends - You must
perceive that I mean what has
been called the [person]person_269|Galvanic battery[/person] or
the apparatus of [person]person_199|Volta[/person]. - - - -
- - I have mentioned that a piece
of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] when brought in

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00015|dnp02d115pp|73408810[/page]
contact are in the relations of negative
& positive; & when many series of this kind
are constructed with [underline]water or an[/underline] imperfect
fluid [underline]conductor interposed[/underline]; - The electrical
power increases in an uniform ratio with
the number - negative electricity being induced
upon every plate naturally negative &
positive electricity upon every plate naturally
positive. - - - -
- - The construction of the [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] instrument,
its agencies, & the theory of its operation
will be demonstrated upon an extensive
sca[superscript]v[/superscript]le. - The Battery before you, is a
small part of a series consisting of 600
plates of the same size, a combination
at least four times as powerful as any
that has been [insertion]hitherto[/insertion] constructed. - - -
- - Whatever is brilliant or impressive
in the experiments made in this course
of lectures; will be owing to the agencies
of this instrument; but it has been
provided not so much for the purpose of

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00016|dnp02d116pp|73408816[/page]
exhibiting what is already known. What
might be accomplished by more simple
means, as for the[underline] end of[/underline] new research
& with the hope of new discovery. ---
-- I trust you will not consider me
as activated by any sentiment of vanity
when I say that the [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] combination
will be presented to you in these lectures
under a [deletion]new[/deletion] [insertion]novel[/insertion] point of view; as offering
the most efficient means of producing
new changes, as being the most powerful
agent that has yet been discovered for
effecting decomposition & new combinations
& [deletion]in this respect[/deletion] [insertion]thus[/insertion] superseding most of the
common chemical powers. - - - -
-- - In this it will be seen that
[person]person_199|Volta[/person] has presented to us a Key
which promises to lay open [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion]
of the most mysterious recesses of Nature. -
- till this discovery our [deletion]powers[/deletion] [insertion]means[/insertion] were
limited, the field of pneumatic research
had been exhausted & little remained
for the experimentalist except laborious

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00017|dnp02d117pp|73408829[/page]

& [underline]minute[/underline] processes - |_There is now before
us, a boundless prospect of novelty in
Science; a Country unexplored, but
noble & [underline]fertile[/underline] in [underline]aspect[/underline] a land of
promise in Philosophy. -
- After having considered the physical
powers & Laws of Electricity & the
combinations invented for exhibiting its
properties - The next object will be the
discussion of its relations to the general
chemical operations of matter | & this enquiry
will naturally follow the History of the
[chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] Battery & will be copious in facts,
instances & inductions. -
[X]|_ - - That Bodies differing in Nature blend
or unite with each other into a common mass
possessed of new properties is the most simple
& ancient fact of chemical affinity; But
that all bodies which have been accurately
examined so combining or blending, are possessed
of opposite electrical energies was for the first
time made publicly known in the course of the
last year. - - - - - [/X]

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00018|dnp02d118pp|73408839[/page]
- Bodies possessed of similar electrical
energies according to the common laws of
electrical attraction & repulsion ought
to repel each other - Bodies possessed
of different electrical energies ought to
attract each other. - |_The question may be
asked then? - is not what has been always
called chemical affinity merely the
union or coalescence, of particles naturally
in opposite electrical states? - & are
not the chemical attractions of particles
& the [underline]electrical[/underline] attractions of masses
owing to one property & governed by
one simple law. - - -.
- - There are extensive series of
phaenomena which favour this idea
& as yet no contradictory fact has
occurred [deletion]to me[/deletion] [underline]& the[/underline] Electrical &
[underline]chemical functions of[/underline] Bodies as far
as our knowledge extends - exist only
together & are modified, created,
or destroyed at the same time. - -

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00019|dnp02d119pp|73408847[/page]
- Thus a metal is naturally positive with
regard to [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical], when this its electricity
is increased it combines with [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], with
more facility; but if it is made negative
it refuses to combine or remain in union -
& repulsion instead of attraction takes place. -
-Acids in general again are negative,
Alkalies, earths & metallic oxides positive; -
& as is well known they unite to form
new compounds; - But if an acid be
made positive by artificial means, it refuses
to combine with alkalies or if alkalies be
made negative, they will no longer act upon
acids;. & by employing different electricities,)
[underline]in consequence[/underline] of [underline]these effects neutral[/underline] salts &
an immense number of [underline]other compounds[/underline] [underline]may[/underline]
be [underline]decomposed[/underline] & their elements obtained.-
[deletion]- - The probability of this idea is evident;[/deletion]
[deletion]but in the present state of our knowledge[/deletion]
[deletion]it would be premature to erect it into[/deletion]
[deletion]a Theory:- New arrangements of facts[/deletion]
[deletion]opposed to it may be discovered, at a[/deletion]

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00020|dnp02d120pp|73408850[/page]
future period; It is a conjecture;
but I trust not a vague one. it has
opened a path of discovery |_& as far
as it has been applied has performed
[underline]more[/underline] even than it promised. -
- Whatever be the fate of the opinion
that electrical energy & chemical
Attraction are one & the same power -
The facts of the dependence of the
chemical arrangements of matter
upon Electrical functions will be
permanent, & will be found to offer
adequate & simple methods for
determining the Nature & species of
bodies & the most refined & exalted
power of analysis. - - - - -
- - Bodies found on chemical examination
to consist either wholly or principally
of inflammable matter are naturally
highly positive - Bodies on the contrary
consisting either entirely or chiefly of

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00021|dnp02d121pp|73408853[/page]
21
matter capable of supporting combustion are
naturally negative ; & where [underline]the two electrical[/underline]
powers are artificially exhibited in the
same system of Bodies, [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & such
substances as contain [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] in excess, are
uniformly brought into a state of rest in
the sphere of positive electricity; & [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical],
[chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical], metals in short
combustible bodies in general are repelled
from the sphere of positive electricity &
attracted into that of negative Electricity.
|_ Metallic oxides, earths & alkalies are
all positive & are attracted by negatively
electrified surfaces - |_but metallic oxides
consist of a large portion of different in=
=flammable matters combined with a small
proportion of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]; - Analogy induced
me to believe that the alkalies & earths
were similar compounds; & experiments
as far as they have gone, have converted
this conjecture into a truth. ----

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00022|dnp02d122pp|73408859[/page]
[deletion]-- The alkalies & such of the Earths[/deletion]
[deletion]as it has been my good fortune to[/deletion]
[deletion]decompose are constituted as I had[/deletion]
[deletion]suspected by [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & highly inflam=[/deletion]
[deletion]=mable bases - the last in excess &[/deletion]
[deletion]these [underline]new bases[/underline] present an assemblage[/deletion]
[deletion]of most extraordinary physical &[/deletion]
[deletion]chemical properties: -[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]Space[/underline] - The bases of the alkalies agree[/deletion]
[deletion]with metals in all sensible [deletion]properties[/deletion] [insertion]qualities[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]except weight, they are lighter than[/deletion]
[deletion]water & one of them is the lightest[/deletion]
[deletion][insertion]solid[/insertion] fluid known to exist. - Such is their[/deletion]
[deletion]attraction for [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] that they separate[/deletion]
[deletion]it from all its combinations that[/deletion]
[deletion]have been tried; & the basis of[/deletion]
[deletion][chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] burns spontaneously on the[/deletion]
[deletion]contact of ice or waters. -[/deletion]
[deletion]- |_ The same system of reasoning[/deletion]
[deletion]which led to the suspicion & discovery[/deletion]
[deletion]of an excess of inflammable matter in[/deletion]
[deletion]alkalies & earths must likewise[/deletion]

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00023|dnp02d123pp|73408869[/page]
induce us to believe that the undecompounded
acids consist of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] in large & combustible
matters in small proportions |_& this seems
to be the fact with the only one that
I have yet been able to experiment upon
the [chemical]chemical_041|boracic acid[/chemical]. -
- In these developments of new elements
new instruments of research are continually
produced, their scientific applications are
almost boundless & the power of electrical
decomposition will probably exhibit to us
all the elements of matter possessing the
functions of positive & negative, of burning,
& of supporting combustion. -
[deletion]- - After having classed the simple or[/deletion]
[deletion]undecompounded principles [deletion]examined[/deletion] [deletion]considered[/deletion] [insertion]examined[/insertion] the[/deletion]
[deletion]primary compounds that they form by[/deletion]
[deletion]union with each other & [deletion]examined[/deletion] [insertion]demonstrated[/insertion] their[/deletion]
[deletion]properties by experiments - The following[/deletion]
[deletion]lectures will be devoted to the consideration[/deletion]
[deletion]of the Bodies formed by more complicated[/deletion]
[deletion]means - the combinations of Acids, alkalies,[/deletion]

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00024|dnp02d124pp|73408877[/page]
oxides, & salts. - - - .
-- Even on this subject we shall
be still guided to a certain extent
by the electrical character - & the
power of union will be found to be
indicated by the energies of the known
elements. -----
- Salts containing an excess of acid
are negative - those containing an
excess of alkali or earth are positive,
& in the [underline]perfectly neutral[/underline] compounds
the electricity appears by common
tests, in perfect equilibrium in a state
of perfect repose - - -
- - The Energy of combination belongs
in the highest degree to simple bodies
- & it almost disappears in very complex
substances & this law is immediately
subservient to the perfection of the
[underline]arrangements of matter[/underline], in living organs. -
- - The elements of the Atmosphere
the ocean & the solid parts of the Earth

[page]25|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00025|dnp02d125pp|73408886[/page]

are constantly acting upon each other so as
to produce combinations fitted for the
ends of life. - Vegetables, by assimilating
water. [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], & inflammable principles
existing in the soil, form materials for a
more perfect structure adapted to resist
the common destructive powers of Nature.
By mechanical agencies matter is divided
so as to be susceptible of the operation of
chemical laws, & by chemical laws, it is
combined for the purposes of animation,
its ultimate & highest destination. -
- |_It has been [superscript]X[/superscript] conjectured that some
even of the functions of living Beings depend
upon electrical changes; & the facts of the
[person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] excitation of muscles [underline]after[/underline] the
death of animals has led to the idea.-
- This subject will be considered &
though it cannot be much [underline]enlightened[/underline]
by our existing knowledge - yet this
knowledge will be [underline]sufficient[/underline] to [underline]overturn[/underline]
some of the bold Hypotheses which

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00026|dnp02d126pp|73408891[/page]
have been attached to it. ---
-- Physiology is as yet the most
independent & least advanced of the
Sciences - |_It unfolds to us the most
admirable [underline]effects[/underline]; but we are unable
to trace their [underline]causes[/underline]. - |_In referring
muscular contraction to electrical
changes we do not advance a step -
it is mere [deletion]conjecture[/deletion] [insertion]supposition -[/insertion] - Electricity
most probably acts as a stimulus
alone in common experiments. - And
the only electrical arrangements known
,in animal structures, those of the [misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc],
[misc]misc_232|gymnotus[/misc] & other fishes are not
organs of vitality but instruments
of attack or defence. ---
-- |_When the grand discoveries of
[person]person_036|Newton[/person] were first developed, it was
the fashion amongst speculators to refer
muscular motion & the motive powers
of animals to mechanical causes; &
& springs & elastic globules were

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00027|dnp02d127pp|73408894[/page]
the machinery imagined. ----
-- With the pneumatic Chemistry arose
the pneumatic physiology when [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_017|Azote[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_054|Carbon[/chemical] became the
supposed energetic agents in living Natures.-
--- The experiments of [person]person_269|Galvani[/person] introduced
positive & negative electricity, & the idea
of muscles & nerves operating on the principle
of the [misc]misc_130|Leyden Phial[/misc]. --
- Most of these dreams have long ago
passed away- All of them will pass
away. -- Life appears to us through
sensible phaenomena; but the powers
concerned in its operations must for ever
be hidden. - To apply the laws of
common matter to organised structures is
seeking the living amongst the dead -
looking for the ruler amidst slaves -
That which sees will not be visible;
- that which touches us will not be felt;
that which [underline]commands[/underline] sensations will

[page]28|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00028|dnp02d128pp|73408896[/page]
not be their subject. ---
-- The lectures will be concluded
with an outline of the History of
the Science - In this I shall have
an opportunity of recapitulating
the principal facts of the course -
of referring them to their inventors
& of considering them in their relations
to human talent & ingenuity. ---
Little space - 
Such is the plan which I shall
attempt to execute; such the nature of
the information which I shall lay before
you -- |_Having developed [underline]my objects[/underline]
it will be improper for me, to say much
of the [underline]advantages[/underline] that may be derived
from this kind of study - You must
already have weighed them & it is
not my wish to [underline]entice[/underline] you to follow
the course, for I should constantly
dread the uneasy feeling of disappointing
you. - - - - -

- The path of Physical discovery so delightful
to Inventors usually appears rough & dis=
=agreeable, to general enquirers. - It is a
way amongst mountains offering Sublime
views - but difficult to the traveller. --
- - Of all subjects however that of
experimental enquiry demands most to be
brought forward in public lectures - It requires
the evidence of the senses - & the methods
used can only be understood, by being
exhibited.- The seed should be spread
abroad & if in a [underline]few instances[/underline] only, it falls
on a fertile soil, the end is accomplished.-
-- |_ In this advanced age of the world
there ought to be no question concerning
the [underline]importance[/underline] of Natural knowledge
of discoveries of the powers of Nature &
of the wise laws by which they are
governed. -
- - It does however sometimes occur
[underline]that the enquiry is[/underline] made, Of what use

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00030|dnp02d130pp|73408909[/page]
is this knowledge? Of what use
is that discovery? & the word
[underline]use[/underline] employed in this way, always
means some vulgar or immediate
application, something connected
with our common wants. -
- I do not mean to insinuate
that even this kind of use should
be neglected in research |_& indeed
it has generally happened "that
great philosophical discoveries have
been accompanied by noble practical
& popular applications - I mean
merely to argue [deletion]only[/deletion] [underline]against too[/underline]
[underline]great an extension of[/underline] the [underline]feeling[/underline]
against an [underline]extension of it which[/underline] makes
Truth & Wisdom & Knowledge
of no importance for their own sakes. -
- [deletion]It has been a common place[/deletion]
[deletion]Saying " that the person who causes[/deletion]

- |_If there be any thing dignified or noble
or worthy of estimation belonging to Humanity
any thing superior to the common sentiment
of self love, it appears in [underline]those faculties[/underline]
by which we endeavour to exalt & sublime
our intellectual nature & to gain a
dominion over the senses |_& after our
sacred & moral duties, there is no pursuit
more worthy of [underline]attention[/underline] than that which
unfolds to us the infinitely wise & wonderful
mechanism of Nature, & which produces
[underline]benefits[/underline] from the hidden properties of things,
ordained in their diversified relations for
the pleasure & advantage of Man. -
- If an objection be made to any of
the truths of [underline]Experimental Science[/underline] from

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10261-000-00032|dnp02d132pp|73408929[/page]
their want of popular application -
how much more will such reasoning
apply to Letters in general, to Poetry
& the fine Arts [insertion]& to those things which ornament & [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] social life[/insertion] yet in this case
it would be more generally found
ridiculous because the taste for them
is more diffused & more fashionable -
& were any one to ask what has
been the use of a sublime poem,
or a beautiful picture or statue
he would not be thought deserving
of an answer. - - -
- - Human Beings have been created
for happiness & a principal means
of obtaining it is by the exercise
of the intellectual faculties, by
an exertion of Reason & imagination,
by imitating Nature & modifying her
operations. |_& Knowledge is no less
necessary to supply the [underline]wants[/underline] of

of the [underline]Body[/underline]. -
- |_If we argue against any species of [underline]true[/underline]
improvement, we argue for the uncultivated
against the civilized condition - for who shall
assign the limits where utility begins & ends;-
The savage would consider as useful only, what
procured food & shelter. -, The civilized Man
extends the term to the comforts, refinements,
& even luxuries, of life; - By the enlightened
mind all these are considered as of importance
[underline]but[/underline] he will place the sources of intellectual
pleasure above them all. -
- The defence of the Sciences has been so
admirably executed by the same great mind
which in modern times fixed their foundations;
that I cannot avoid giving a few sentences
[underline]from his works, on the subject.-[/underline]
[Horizontal rule]
- "The introduction of noble discoveries,"
says our Author, "seems to hold by far

the most excellent place among all
human actions | & this was the judgment
of antiquity which attributed [underline]divine[/underline]
honours to inventors but conferred
only [underline]heroical[/underline] honours on those who
deserved well of their Country in civil
affairs - And whoever rightly considers
will find this a judicious custom |_ for
the merit of civil benefits is confined
within the circle of an age or nation -;
& is like a fruitful shower which
though profitable & good serves only
for a season & fertilizes a single spot;-
- But discoveries are like blessings of
Heaven permanent & universal

& the desire [underline]of memory[/underline] fame & celebration -
|_But the monuments of invention & learning
are far more durable than the monuments
of power or the work of the most skilful
hands, for the first decay & are injured
or destroyed but the last remain & are
perpetuated by letters exempted from the
wrongs of time or capable of perfect
renovation". -
- In this eulogium the illustrious Author
has alluded to knowledge & invention in
general; but it may be particularly said
of discoveries in experimental philosophy
that they cannot but produce benefits &
can by no means be turned to evil or unworthy
purposes. -

- - Literature & the refined Arts though
most noble in their general effects may be
misapplied. - Natural Science on the
contrary being an exhibition of the powers
existing in the Universe of things cannot
be subservient to the passions, prejudices,
or vices of Men. - As far as it influences
the mind it must correct all evil tendencies
& having a sublime origin in philosophical
minds it descends even to the most familiar
offices & is subservient to common purposes.-
Like a stream rising amongst mountains, it
flows from the heavens to the earth - & though
in its begin[deletion]n[/deletion]ings it is known only to a
few, its benefits gradually extend, &
it at length adorns & fertilizes an
extensive & populous district. - - -
