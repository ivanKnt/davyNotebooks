distinctions between gravitation, cohesion,
magnetic & electrical attraction, & to
follow the facts awaiting patiently
the progress of discovering & the perfection
of analogies. - - -
- - The phenomena of electrical attraction
& repulsion the immediate objects of our
enquiry are not merely important in
themselves but they are guides in our
future progress in electro-chemical Science
& they will therefore require a full
experimental demonstration. - - - -
- - When a rod of glass is heated &
brought into the vicinity of a pith ball;
the pith ball moves towards it & for a
moment adheres to it. - But if it be
made to act upon two pith balls these
will repel each other - & in this case -
as it is evident that they have both
received a similar impression they are
said to be in similar electrical states
