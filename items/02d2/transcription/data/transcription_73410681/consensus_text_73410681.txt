same time - In proportion as the repulsion
between the two pieces of gold [insertion]leaf[/insertion] is great -
so in proportion is the Electricity judged
to be strong. - And when the repulsion
produced by the contact of any body is
still farther increased by the contact
or approach of electrified glass - that
body is considered as positive; - but
if the leaves collapse it is then
considered as negative. - - - -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
& in this way it is easy
to examine & to determine
the Electrical states of Bodies
This happy & delicate invention
we owe to M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Bennet; who
contrived by means of it to exhibit
electricities which before his time
had never been suspected to
exist |_ There is another electrometer
