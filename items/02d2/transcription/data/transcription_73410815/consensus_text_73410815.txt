an intensity that the spark
barely passes through a sensible
space in air. Hence Water
insulates this electricity almost
as much as Air insulates
common Electricity -: It is
upon living Bodies which

[deletion]of imperfect conductors[/deletion] which [insertion]when the skin is moist[/insertion] [deletion]that[/deletion]
are of the highest order of imperfect conductors that
its [deletion]energy[/deletion] power is exerted; - &
there can be little doubt; but
that if the Electricity of
the Eel of Surinam were
passed through [insertion]them[/insertion] metallic wires
it would occasion their ignition
in the same manner as that of
the Voltaic Instrument .-
