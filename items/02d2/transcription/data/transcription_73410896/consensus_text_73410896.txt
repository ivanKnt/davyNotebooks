thus I have heard it asserted
that a pinch of Snuff has
a different [deletion]effect[/deletion] flavour or
odour when taken out of
a metallic Box [deletion]or a[/deletion] [insertion]than when it[/insertion] 
[insertion]is taken out of a[/insertion] box of wood or shell " which
if it be true cannot
depend on Electricity for
no electrical circle is
formed in the operation
of snuff taking.
After all that has
been stated with regard to
the electrical energy or
electromotive power of contact
it may perhaps be still
asked is it an ultimate
principle? cannot it be
referred to some more
general law. -
