1)
- - . Matter appears to us through the
mediums of the sensations of touch & of vision 
- & all our judgements with regard to external
things are founded upon the correspondence
or coincidence of these two senses. (As the
impressions we derive from them are almost infinitely
diversified, we assume an equal diversity of
external objects - As the images of things appear
to us in parts & in successions so we assume
divisibility & extension as properties of matter
& this mode of reasoning which is derived imme=
=diately from the powers of the Human Understanding
is justly applied in its various details to the
phenomena of the external Universe. - - -
â€“ - - [underline]Change[/underline] is the essence of all the operations
Change is the essence of all the operations
in Nature & change may constantly be referred
to motion; [insertion].-But[/insertion] (but for motion there must be a
moving cause; & this necessarily implies the
existence of active powers. - - -
- - In the great phenomena of the solar
system, the various & harmonious mutations

[page]2||dnp02d202pp|73410644[/page]
of the heavenly Bodies are accounted for by
the supposition of two energies operating upon
matter, gravitation & the projectile force;
& the laws of these have been submitted
to calculation by the power & sagacity
of Human Genius. - - - 
- - In the terrestrial order of events
the uniformity of operating causes is less
evident; but still it may be traced;
& that even in strict analogies. - |_By
the tendencies of substances to approach,
or recede from each other; - the various
alterations of the forms of things whether
obvious or obscure rapid or slow may
be explained. & Attraction & repulsion
established as motive agents or influences
- - In our discussions on every part
of the Science of Nature we are obliged
to recur to these powers - But though
sound Philosophy permits us to allow them
as [underline]active[/underline] it is far from considering them
as inherent in or necessarily attached
to Matter -. After the example of

[page]3||dnp02d203pp|73410645[/page]
Newton they may be considered as principal
but not ultimate as secondary & not
primary causes. - -
- - In Nature nothing can be truly said
to be automatic - one order of events flows
from another - an immense number of phe=
= nomena depend upon a single law; - but
all may be considered as a work of [deletion]divine[/deletion]
mechanism & of divine institution. - In
human inventions, springs may move springs
& wheels, wheels but the first motion & the
regulation must be derived from the Artist.
Sounds may be occasioned by undulations in
the air; undulations of the air may proceed
from vibrations of strings; but the impulse
& the melody must arise from the Master. -
[Horizontal rule]
- - Every species of Attraction & Repulsion
that we are acquainted with [underline]may be[/underline] the
result of one grand & universally operating
Law; & the farther we advance in Science,
the more this idea becomes probable: At
present however it is necessary to make

[page]4||dnp02d204pp|73410647[/page]
distinctions between gravitation, cohesion,
magnetic & electrical attraction, & to
follow the facts awaiting patiently
the progress of discovering & the perfection
of analogies. - - -
- - The phenomena of electrical attraction
& repulsion the immediate objects of our
enquiry are not merely important in
themselves but they are guides in our
future progress in electro-chemical Science
& they will therefore require a full
experimental demonstration. - - - -
- - When a rod of glass is heated &
brought into the vicinity of a pith ball;
the pith ball moves towards it & for a
moment adheres to it. - But if it be
made to act upon two pith balls these
will repel each other - & in this case -
as it is evident that they have both
received a similar impression they are
said to be in similar electrical states

[page]5||dnp02d205pp|73410651[/page]

or similarly electrified
Instance
Glass, Sealing Wax Pith balls.
- - When a pith ball or other light substance
is acted on by glass - & another pith ball by
a piece of Sulphur - these balls will attract
each other & as they are acted upon by two
different bodies & present phenomena different
from those they would present if acted on by
the same body - they are said to be in
different electrical states or differently electrified.
Instance
- - Two pith balls that repel each other
in consequence of the agency of glass will
have their repulsive energy not destroyed
but increased by the approach of heated
or rubbed rock crystal - but they will

[page]6||dnp02d206pp|73410661[/page]
lose it if they are acted on by heated
sulphur. - Instance
- - Two balls likewise made to repel
each other by the agency of Sulphur, will
repel each other still more by the approach
of Resin or Sealing Wax; but their
repulsion will cease by the influence
of heated glass.-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
(- The electricity produced by [insertion]sealing wax.[/insertion] [deletion]resin[/deletion]
then seems to destroy or as it were
neutralize the Electricity produced by
glass - & hence has been founded
the distinction of two electricities -
[underline]Vitreous[/underline], the electricity of glass; -
[underline]Resinous[/underline], the electricity of sealing wax. -
Space [underline]1[/underline]
[deletion]- - These distinctions were first made[/deletion]
[deletion]by Du Fay who supposed the existence[/deletion]
[deletion]of two specific fluids repellent as to[/deletion]
[deletion]their own particles - but attractive as[/deletion]
[deletion]to the particles of each other . - -[/deletion]

[page]7||dnp02d207pp|73410671[/page]
- - In the Nomenclature of Electricity
commonly adopted in this Country - Positive
or plus is synonymous with Vitreous; -
& Negative or minus with resinous electricity.
The words positive & negative plus & minus
are sanctioned by the authority of [unclear]Frankline[/unclear]
who has accounted for the phenomena by
the supposition of one fluid only - in excess
in bodies possessing the vitreous electricity -
in deficiency in those exhibiting the resinous
electricity. - -
- It is unfortunate for the diffusion
of Science that any terms should be in
common use which imply hypothetical ideas;
but in the present early stage of the investigation
it is better to adopt even an imperfect
Language than to form a new one. - The
denominations as I shall use them you will
have the goodness to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]consider[/insertion] as merely
signifying the unknown causes of a certain
series of facts; |_[deletion]That the phenomena must[/deletion]

[page]8||dnp02d208pp|73410677[/page]
Space
[deletion]depend upon the agencies of some species[/deletion]
[deletion]of subtile matter it is impossible to[/deletion]
[deletion]doubt; but whether it is simple[/deletion]
[deletion]or capable of being analysed - there[/deletion]
[deletion]are at present no means of determining: -[/deletion]
[deletion]We as yet have witnessed but the[/deletion]
[deletion]dawning of the Science of Etherial fluids -[/deletion]
[deletion]& before we can clearly distinguish[/deletion]
[deletion]the numerous objects it infolds[/deletion]
[deletion]we must wait for the full day. )-[/deletion]
- - By the common Electrical Machine
of the construction of Nairne - we may
gain some good elucidations of the
effects referred to positive & negative
electricity. - - -
- - The two cylinders of Metal opposite
to the glass are in an active state. -
Were they similarly electrified the effect
ought to be increased by connecting them; .
but it is not increased it is destroyed.
they must therefore be in opposite states. -

- Two cylinders made of paper covered with
leaf gold placed in contact with either of
the metallic Cylinders & possessed of freedom
of motion repel each other when electrified.
but if the paper cylinders be distributed
one upon each of the metallic cylinders, -
they will then attract each other - distinctly
demonstrating the two properties the negative
& the positive
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- - Electrical attractions & repulsions form
the only measures that we have of the force
or strength of electricity & furnish the only
test in our possession of the difference
between the two kinds of of action. - - -
- - The common gold leaf Electrometer
is founded upon the principle of repulsion
indicating identity of electrization & attraction
diversity or contrariety & it is composed
of two pieces of leaf gold attached
near each other & capable of being
acted on by an electrified body at the

[page]10||dnp02d210pp|73410681[/page]
same time - In proportion as the repulsion
between the two pieces of gold [insertion]leaf[/insertion] is great -
so in proportion is the Electricity judged
to be strong. - And when the repulsion
produced by the contact of any body is
still farther increased by the contact
or approach of electrified glass - that
body is considered as positive; - but
if the leaves collapse it is then
considered as negative. - - - -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
& in this way it is easy
to examine & to determine
the Electrical states of Bodies
This happy & delicate invention
we owe to M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Bennet; who
contrived by means of it to exhibit
electricities which before his time
had never been suspected to
exist |_ There is another electrometer

[page]11||dnp02d211pp|73410683[/page]
on the same principle of repulsion
which was first constructed by
Colomb & presented by him to
the Academy of Sciences of Paris -
It consists of a pith ball covered
with gold leaf attached to
one end of a fine [deletion]metal[/deletion]
metallic wire & ballanced
at the other end by a piece
of metallic leaf.-. It is suspended
by a very delicate wire of
gold or silver or the single
filament of a Silk worm-. And
[deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]on[/insertion] the ease with which the
wire of filament is turned
or twisted the sensibility of the
instrument depends. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[deletion]It was by means of this instrument[/deletion]
[deletion]that Colomb was enabled to[/deletion]
[deletion]ascertain " that the force of Electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]attractions are inversely as the[/deletion]

[page]12||dnp02d212pp|73410684[/page]
[deletion]square of the distance of[/deletion]
[deletion]the acting bodies so that in[/deletion]
[deletion]this respect the Attraction of[/deletion]
[deletion]Gravitation & the electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]attraction exercise their functions[/deletion]
[deletion]in precisely the same[/deletion]
[deletion]manner.[/deletion]

Considerable space
|_ - It is evident from the various
phenomena you have already
witnessed that the agent or
agents [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] occasioning electrical
effects are capable of being
[deletion]carried[/deletion] [insertion]transferred[/insertion] or communicated from
one Body or system of
Bodies to others |_ & it is necessary
to enquire what are y[superscript]e[/superscript] circumstances
of this phenomenon & whether
different substances are possessed
of [deletion]different[/deletion] distinct powers [insertion]or[/insertion] of [deletion]the[/deletion] the
same powers with regard to
[deletion]conducting Electricity[/deletion]
communication or transfer.

We find in our first & most simple
experiments remarkable differences
& we are able to arrange
bodies under three distinct
classes in consequence of
their relations. to this property
into conductors, imperfect conductors
& nonconductors.-
[deletion]A conductor[/deletion]
Bodies are called conductors
when they readily admit the
passage of Electricity along their
parts.- [deletion][unclear]in[/unclear][/deletion]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
All the metals are perfect
conductors; charcoal likewise belongs
to this class & some of
the Metallic ores.-
-. An imperfect conductor is
a substance which though
it admits the passage of Electricity

[page]14||dnp02d214pp|73410703[/page]
yet seems to [unclear]oppose[/unclear] obstacles
to it or at least conveys
it very slowly.-
-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Water & fluids containing
water are imperfect conductors.
so likewise are the greater
number of animal or vegetable
Substances in their common state.-
[unclear]not living[/unclear]
-:. Bodies that [deletion]wholly[/deletion] are wholly
incapable of suffering the
electrical fluid to move
along their surfaces are called
nonconductors. - Such is glass
- Instance. -
Hence nonconductors are said
to insulate, to prevent the
transfer or communication
of [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Electricity & hence

[page]15||dnp02d215pp|73410713[/page]
they form a necessary part
of all our apparatus for y[superscript]e[/superscript]
[unclear]artifcical[/unclear] excitement of
Electricity. - Stones &
Gems of all kind amber
Resin, Sulphur, air &
most of the fluid and solid
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] highly inflammable bodies
are non conductors.-
[Horizontal Rule]
It must however be understood
"That in each of these three
classes there are [insertion]may be[/insertion] [deletion]considerable[/deletion]
differences with regard to
the [underline]degree[/underline] of conducting
energy -
[deletion]With[/deletion] In respect to the
perfect conductors such as
the Metals & charcoal it
is [insertion]not[/insertion] easy to find means of
determining this point - |_The
finest metallic wire or the

[page]16||dnp02d216pp|73410716[/page]
thinnest filament of [insertion]wellburnt[/insertion] charcoal
seems capable of conveying: instant
aneously or rather in no
perceptible time the largest
quantity of Electricity - And
the only limit in experiments
of this kind is the fusibility
of Metals; - [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] A wire of
Tin [deletion]will serve the[/deletion] or of [deletion][unclear]case[/unclear][/deletion] lead
will convey a large quantity
of electricity as well & in
the same manner as a
wire of iron or platina as
long as the discharge is
not [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] capable of producing
sufficient heat to melt them
& it is only from the loss of
continuity that their power
is destroyed for the fused metals
are still perfect conductors
[Horizontal rule]
- Instance -
[underline]Galvanic Battery[/underline]- [underline]Wire of Tin[/underline]
[underline]Wire of [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] Platina[/underline]

[page]17||dnp02d217pp|73410717[/page]
- A still higher discharge would
fuse even [underline]Platina[/underline] - | & where
Buildings furnished with conductors
are injured by lightning it
generally happens that the
conductor is [deletion][unclear]fused[/unclear][/deletion] melted; the
discharge being too [deletion]great[/deletion] intense
to pass through it without
destroying [deletion]its[/deletion] the aggregation
of the Metal. --
[Horizontal Rule]
[underline]Space[/underline] considerable 1 page
- The difference of the degree
of the conducting function in
different [underline]imperfect[/underline] conductors
is known by the time
they require to discharge
equal quantities of Electricity
ie [deletion]it[/deletion] the [deletion]s[/deletion] conducting power
is inversely as the time

[page]18||dnp02d218pp|73410719[/page]
- If this fine tube be filled
[deletion]with water[/deletion] with [underline]Alcohol[/underline] or
highly rectified spirits.- it will
require more than a minute
to discharge this jar by
means of it; Whereas water
would discharge it [insertion]less than a second[/insertion] [deletion]in about [/deletion]
[deletion]a second[/deletion] - So that the
conducting power must be
at least 60 times as great
as that of [underline]Alcohol[/underline] which
is a very imperfect conductor.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
-: Again if a glass tube
of a finer bore were filled
with water; & made to
discharge a [deletion]battery[/deletion] [insertion]jar[/insertion] of such
a size & in such a state
that it required three minutes
for the process: - the same
tube filled with oil of Vitriol

[page]19||dnp02d219pp|73410729[/page]
[deletion]or[/deletion] Sulphuric Acid would discharge
in an imperceptible time
in much less than a second
so that it must conduct
many hundred times better
than [underline]Water[/underline].
- In general Salts acids or
alkalies dissolved in Water
considerably increase its
conducting power; whilst
inflammable fluids such as
spirits & Ether diminish
this power.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish has computed
that sea water conducts 100
times better than common water
& a saturated Solution of salt
7 times as [underline]well[/underline] as sea
Water.
-:. Sulphuric Acid seems the
best of the imperfect
conductors; but still here is
an immense distance between its

[page]20||dnp02d220pp|73410739[/page]
power & those of the metals -
|_A surface of sulphuric acid
of considerable size is required
to carry off the whole discharge
of this Battery; but the least
visible surface of Metals is adequate
to the effect - so that the
conducting power must be at
least some hundred of
thousand times greater.- -
-: - Some of the worst of the
imperfect conductors may be
said to form the link
between this class & the
class of nonconductors such
are very pure Alcohol &
ether -
[unclear]Qu.[/unclear] instance
Amongst the nonconductors
the most perfect are the
Gems glass & hard bodies of
a vitreous texture [insertion]Amber, Resin Wax[/insertion] Chrystaline
Salts follow next in order of

[page]21||dnp02d221pp|73410748[/page]
insulating power - after these the
fixed oils & last of all
the Volatile oils.-
-. As we are unacquainted
With the intimate nature of
the agent producing Electricity
so we are likewise ignorant
of that peculiar constitution
of bodies on which their
different relations to the
conducting energy depend. -
It might at first [insertion]view[/insertion] be supposed
that the densest Bodies conducted
best. For Airs & oils and Resins
are [deletion]all[/deletion] of extremely low specific
gravity: & the metals are
[deletion]a[/deletion] of high specific gravity; but
this idea is wholly untenable
For Barytes which is four times
as heavy as water is a perfect
nonconductor; & the new Substance

[page]22||dnp02d222pp|73410749[/page]
which forms the Basis of the
Vegetable alkali though lighter
than Ether or Naptha conducts
as well as Platina the
heaviest Body in Nature.
- Any change however slight
in the chemical [underline]constitution[/underline]
[underline]or form[/underline], of Body is almost
always connected with a corresponding
change in its [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] conducting
energy. - The Metals by
absorbing a small quantity
of pure air all [deletion]of them[/deletion]
become nonconductors. - Charcoal
as long as it flames [insertion]by Heat[/insertion] that
is as long as it contains any
inflammable air or Hydrogene
is a non conductor; but when
it bears a white Heat without
flaming that is when it is

[page]23||dnp02d223pp|73410750[/page]
free from Hydrogene [unclear]it[/unclear] conducts
12 as well as the [underline]Metals[/underline]
- Water when converted into ice
or steam is a [underline]non conductor[/underline]
but glass or any of the
saline substances when rendered
fluid by heat become conductors.
-: Solids and fluids suffer no
change in their conducting
powers by any [insertion]mere[/insertion] mechanical alteration
[deletion]change[/deletion], or division of their
parts /_ & as long as they
retain their own peculiar forms
[deletion]however expanded by[/deletion] [insertion]their power seems independent of[/insertion]
expansion from Heat or of
contraction by cold . - This however
may be owing to the [insertion]circumstances[/insertion] [deletion]changes[/deletion]
[deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]that the changes in volume[/insertion] we are capable of
producing are too small to
[deletion]produce[/deletion] [insertion]occasion[/insertion] any appretiable
differences; for with [underline]airs[/underline] [deletion]th[/deletion] which

[page]24||dnp02d224pp|73410752[/page]
we are capable of expanding
& contracting to a great extent
without destroying their peculiar
form, the case is very different
Air in its common state so
good an insulating substances
[underline]becomes[/underline] (when considerably
rarified either by Heat or by
removing pressure from it)
very permeable to the electrical
agency; & from its transparent
nature offers a [unclear]very[/unclear] beautiful
appearance during the
passage of Electricity through
its parts. -

These [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] exhibitions have been
considered [deletion][unclear]by[/unclear][/deletion] [deletion]reasonably enough[/deletion]
as imitations upon a small
scale of the magnificent
natural phaenomena of the
Aurora Borealis , & australis.-
- That [deletion]these[/deletion] the Northern lights
must depend upon [unclear]xxx[/unclear] the
discharge of Electricity through
highly rarified air there
is the strongest [insertion]reason to beleive[/insertion] [deletion]evidence[/deletion] ([unclear]but[/unclear]
the [deletion]probable[/deletion] theory of y[superscript]e[/superscript] excitation
of this electricity[insertion]admits of some discussion & [deletion]will[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion][unclear]will[/unclear][/deletion] [deletion]properly[/deletion]

[Horizontal rule]
[deletion]As far as this[/deletion]
Perfect conductors as we
have seen carry off electricity
under all circumstances with
a rapidity that cannot be

made about 50 years ago
by the French academicians
A discharge was [deletion][unclear]made[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]passed[/insertion]
along wires that extended
for nearly two miles;- but
it took place in no
sensible time & the spark
at one extremity & the
other were simultaneously

was obtaine in England.
|_The extension of the
chain being nearly to four

the [underline]rapidity of the motion[/underline]
of the Electricity which they
are capable of [deletion]conducting[/deletion];

- |_We have already [deletion]seen[/deletion] [insertion]witnessed however[/insertion] that
[deletion]where[/deletion] [insertion]where[/insertion] imperfect conductors are
used for discharging large
[underline]quantities[/underline] of Electricity, they do not
carry it off at once; but
require a certain time for
the operation |_& it is a
circumstance to which I beg
particularly to call your
attention "that" they will
carry off [deletion]the[/deletion] or transmit
the [underline]same quantity[/underline] of Electricity
in a [deletion]shorter[/deletion] [insertion]longer[/insertion] time when it is

Let the Electricity of this
Phial which could be
discharged by this column
of Water by a single contact
be communicated to a
[unclear]jar[/unclear] of six times the
surface & it will require
a much longer time for
its discharge - & by using
a jar of a thousand
times the surface it would
have no perceptible effect
- In these cases the [underline]power of[/underline]
motion of the electricity, or as
it usually called its [underline]intensity[/underline]
is diminished in proportion
to the increase of the surface &

[page]31||dnp02d231pp|73410796[/page]
the efficacy of imperfect conductors
in carrying off Electricity is
directly as its intensity
There is a measure of the
Intensity or power of [deletion]the[/deletion]
Motion of electricity in the distance
[deletion]length[/deletion] [deletion]of[/deletion] through which a
spark will pass [deletion]through[/deletion] in
air to a conductor & the
intensity is said to be less
in proportion as this distance
is smaller =; |_This jar highly
charged will give a spark which

an inch of air;- but the

a single line; & - if the
transfer had been made into

[page]32||dnp02d232pp|73410805[/page]
a battery of 10 or 12 such jars;
the effect of the spark could
only be produced by [deletion]apparent[/deletion] [insertion]absolute[/insertion]
contact of the metallic surfaces.-

[unclear][deletion]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion][deletion]principle[/deletion] of attention to the principle[/insertion] [underline]that imperfect conductors[/underline]

[underline]large quantities of[/underline] Electricity

[underline]in a low state of intensity[/underline]
that there [deletion]has been[/deletion] [insertion]existed[/insertion] so much
discussion with regard to the
identity or nonidentity of
Galvanism & Electricity.-
|_A view of the phaenomena
[deletion][unclear]aft[/unclear][/deletion] according to the ideas that
have been just stated immediately
removes every doubt -
In the Voltaic Battery the

[page]33||dnp02d233pp|73410813[/page]
intensity of the electricity is
so low that it does not pass
through any sensible distance
of air; & of course such Electricity
could not be expected to [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] be
very rapidly [deletion]through[/deletion] [insertion]carried off by[/insertion] imperfectly
conducting Bodies, though it
is instantaneously transported
by [underline]metals[/underline] . .
This Battery contains a
large quantity of surface
& the electricity is of so
low an intensity that
the wires must be brought
in contact to produce
a spark - We cannot
therefore expect that it
should be rapidly carried off
