"That if Bodies artificially brought
into oppositive states of Electricity
exert an [underline]attractive influence[/underline],

of motion in their particles
or elementary Matters [deletion]be conceived[/deletion]
existed; in this case these
particles or these elementary
Matters ought to approach
& to remain in union.-
-For instance if we consider
plates of copper & Zinc - /_ The
Electrical energy or the Electricity
exhibited by contact can act only
