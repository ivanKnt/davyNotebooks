& water were [underline]elements[/underline], to
us they are compounds.-
Our various [insertion]species of[/insertion] attractions may
all [insertion]possibly[/insertion] be resolved into one
grand power.- To speak
positively of the nature
of objects which we have
as yet seen only in the
twilight would be presumptuous.
