- In the phaenomena of decomposition
of neutral salts & other bodies by
Electricity, if the suppositions
which have been stated be
correct if the [deletion]natural[/deletion] effect
be owing to [insertion]the ballance or destruction of the[/insertion] the natural
electrical energies by the artificial
influence then it [insertion]must[/insertion] 
follow that the attraction
of the alkali or Metal to
the negative surface & of
the acid to the positive surface
ought to produce increase
of temperature; for it is
here that they find their points of rest
here that their peculiar electricities
must come into equilibrium -
- New experiments shew that
this result uniformly occurs & it
