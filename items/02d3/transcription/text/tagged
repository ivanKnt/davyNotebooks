[underline]1808[/underline]. [underline]Lecture VI[/underline] Electrochem: Science
- The Electrical phaenomena that [deletion][unclear]we[/unclear][/deletion] you
have witnessed & that I endeavored
to elucidate in the preceding
Lectures are of limited application
[deletion]to the phaenomena of Nature[/deletion]
[deletion]& of Art.-[/deletion] The subjects which
are now to occupy our attention
though they offer appearances perhaps
less brilliant & less impressive
are yet of much more considerable
extent & of much greater importance.
- The physical effects of Electricity
those associated with Heat & Light or Fire
though splendid & magnificent are
yet [insertion]for the most part[/insertion] of rare occurrence, the
chemical results on the contrary
as I shall endeavor to prove
are [deletion]though [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] & [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] constantly[/deletion] [insertion]uniformly[/insertion]
taking place & connected with
the constant order of operations

both in Nature & Art.-
- I shall not be expected to
enter into a [deletion][unclear]full[/unclear][/deletion] definition
of what is [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] meant by chemical
results. [blockdeletion]|_"the sense of the
word will be better illustrated
by some familiar instances
- All those changes by which
Water is raised into the
Air & [deletion]deposited[/deletion] [insertion]precipitated[/insertion] again upon
the surface -. by which Rivers
or lakes dissolve & deposit
solid matter. - By which Rocks
are converted into Earths; &
by which Soils afford materials
to Water so as to [deletion]become[/deletion] [insertion]render it[/insertion]
the Nourishment of Plants, [deletion]are[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] & [unclear]x[/unclear] & it[/deletion] all these beautiful

- The contemplation of such
facts, whether exhibiting the wonderful
order of the system of Nature
or presenting proofs of the
exercise of Human talents, is
a delightful subject of contemplation
|_& the study of their causes, or the
laws by which they [insertion]are governed[/insertion] [deletion]depend[/deletion]
is a noble exercise for
the [deletion]Reason[/deletion] [insertion]Understanding[/insertion] -
From what do they result
on what hidden properties of
things do they depend? These
are questions which even a

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00005|dnp02d305pp|73411347[/page]
moderate degree [insertion]only[/insertion] of curiosity
must lead to; & they are[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]
questions the Solution of which
will [deletion]lead[/deletion] [insertion]carry[/insertion] us to the discussion
of the intimate relations existing
between Chemistry & Electricity
& to the devellopement of those
principles on which I have
ventured to found the
arrangements of Electrochemical
Science .-
-. In all [deletion]modern[/deletion] Elementary
treatises upon Chemistry [deletion]& there[/deletion]
[deletion]are no ancient ones worthy of[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] perusal[/deletion] the changes &
the forms of Substances -are justly
referred to an Attractive
force acting upon the particles
of Matter which is called
chemical affinity or chemical

-: I [deletion]often[/deletion] see with a mixed
sensation of pleasure & uneasiness
seated [deletion][unclear]around[/unclear][/deletion] in these benches Proficients
in Science much more capable
of instructing me than I am
of enlightening them, proficients
to whom the Elementary truths
can be but as the

duty of a lecturer to address
himself to the uninitiated "that
it should be his pride to render

[deletion]principles of reasoning which[/deletion]
[deletion]I shall attempt [deletion]xx publish[/deletion] to bring[/deletion]
[deletion]forward on the subject are[/deletion]
[deletion]fully explained . -[/deletion]
You have seen demonstrated
by abundant evidences in
the first part of this
Course that bodies [deletion][unclear]not[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] in opposite states of
electricity have a tendency
to attract each other &
that bodies in the same
states of Electricity have
a tendency to repel
each other.
- Particular instances were
given both in the agencies
of the apparatus now before
You & in those of [person]person_375|Nairne's[line]machine[/person]. - Pieces of gold leaf
positively, or negatively electrified.

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00011|dnp02d311pp|73411381[/page]
[insertion]together[/insertion] repelled each other, pieces respectively
positive & negative attracted each
[insertion]other[/insertion] - It was likewise [deletion]stated[/deletion][insertion]mentioned[/insertion]
"That certain Bodies are naturally
[deletion]positive & negative[/deletion] in opposite states of
Electricity, positive & negative
[deletion]with respect to each other.[/deletion]
[insertion]which was[/insertion] the
case with respect to [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
& [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical]:- [chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical] & Silver
alkalies & Acids.
-And that this property or
Electrical energy (as I have
ventured to call it) is independent
of any accidental circumstances
& constantly exists & is exerted
as an active power of
Matter, requiring contact alone
for its exhibition.-
-Now it is evident. " [deletion]that[/deletion] such

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00012|dnp02d312pp|73411383[/page]
[deletion]Bodies as are permanently in oppositive[/deletion]
"That if Bodies artificially brought
into oppositive states of Electricity
exert an [underline]attractive influence[/underline],
|_ Bodies permanently & naturally
in opposite[deletion]ive[/deletion] states ought to
display a similar effect; |_& that
though the power [deletion]ought[/deletion] [insertion]may[/insertion] not
be sufficiently [deletion]strong[/deletion] [insertion]intense[/insertion] to cause
them to adhere [insertion]strongly[/insertion] together [deletion][unclear]as[/unclear][/deletion]in
[deletion][unclear]gr[/unclear][/deletion] masses - yet if a freedom
of motion in their particles
or elementary Matters [deletion]be conceived[/deletion]
existed; in this case these
particles or these elementary
Matters ought to approach
& to remain in union.-
-For instance if we consider
plates of [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] - |_ The
Electrical energy or the Electricity
exhibited by contact can act only

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00013|dnp02d313pp|73411385[/page]
superficially - The inner particles
of the two Bodies cannot
exert their [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]respective forces,
And of course [underline]the adhesion[/underline] of
the [underline]surfaces[/underline] from electrical powers
must be expected (as it is found
to be) very small.- Nor if
the neg electricity of the [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical]
& the positive electricity of
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] were exalted by
artificial means [insertion]by the electrical machine[/insertion] would they
then even attract each other
with any great increase of
force for still the [insertion]electrified[/insertion] surface
would be very small compared
with the mass |_& to render
them strongly attractive they
ought to be [deletion]beat[/deletion]hammered
into very thin leaves.-
But if the [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
be in fusion, "that is rendered

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00014|dnp02d314pp|73411394[/page]
[underline]fluid by Heat[/underline] - . The particles
then moving freely amongst
each other will necessarily
exert their respective
attractive powers dependent
upon Electricity - And each
particle of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] being
positive with regard to
each particle of [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical]
[underline]an[/underline] [underline]attraction[/underline] an approach
ought to take place - &
as these opposite electricities
are permanent. so ought
their union to be (& by
mixing the two masses there
ought to be a general
blending or combination
of their parts, Which

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00015|dnp02d315pp|73411404[/page]
actually happens, for [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] &
[chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] when fused together
suffer such an approximation
of parts as renders them
a compound Body |_&
[chemical]chemical_321|[underline]brass[/underline][/chemical] is the result of
the [underline]mutual[/underline] [underline]adherence[/underline] of
their elementary materials.-
This phaenomenon has been
[deletion]generally[/deletion] constantly referred to Chemical
attraction; but Chemical
Attraction or affinity as I
endeavored to [unclear]^[/unclear] shew is merely
a word signifying the tendencies
of the [underline]particles[/underline] of substances
to approach each other; &
in this instance as well
as in all others it may
be identical with the electrical

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00016|dnp02d316pp|73411415[/page]
corpuscular attraction. - The existence
of this last we must admit
the operations that it ought
to occasion are precisely
those of chemical union.-
And in Philosophy "That
[otherwork]otherwork_095|Maxim of Newton[/otherwork] ought
always to be followed
that no more causes
be admitted than are
adequate to account for
effects. [short horizontal rule]
-. If Electrical & Chemical
Attraction be of the same
Nature., it follows that
all such Bodies as exhibit
opposite electrical energies in
our artificial experiments
ought under certain circumstances

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00017|dnp02d317pp|73411416[/page]
to enter into chemical union, &
this is actually the case.-
- [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] [deletion]w[/deletion]have been just
adduced as an instance - Gold
& [chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical] -, Gold & Silver - Most
of the Metals - [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & the
Metals - The acids & the
alkalies - the acids & the Earths
are all possessed of affinity
& they all likewise exhibit under
proper circumstances the electricity
of contact -. All Bodies in
short that have been examined
that enter into union with each
other: where the proper conditions
have been obtained have
been [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]found oppositely electrical
& though in certain cases of
the exhibition of Electrical energy
when one Body is compound
or when both are compound

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00018|dnp02d318pp|73411418[/page]
[deletion]they cannot be made to unite[/deletion]
[deletion]without [underline]some change[/underline] in the[/deletion]
certain changes of decomposition
must precede the ultimate
union yet even in this
case [insertion]as will be hereafter distinctly shewn[/insertion] the Law of these
changes is precisely conformable
[deletion]as will be hereafter[/deletion]
to the Law of Electrical
energy all which circumstance
coincide in shewing that
the idea is neither visionary
nor unwarrantable, but proper
for discussion & for comparison
with experiments.-
Having thus develloped the
[underline]general notion[/underline], I shall endeavour
to illustrate it by some sensible
results which though they
cannot be exhibited upon
a very great scale, will

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00019|dnp02d319pp|73411420[/page]
yet I hope be sufficiently distinct
|_& which will I trust be
found to offer [underline][deletion][unclear]true[/unclear][/deletion] arguments[/underline]
giving in evidence of strong
probability, of distinct semblance
to truth.-
- As the combination of different
Substances is supposed to depend
upon the difference in their
natural electrical states it follows
as a possible consequence "that
by bringing Bodies possessed of
the power of chemical combination
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] into the same electrical state
by artificial means, their power
of union may be destroyed.
|_& this it will be seen
is actually the case
- [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] as I mentioned
is naturally positive with

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00020|dnp02d320pp|73411421[/page]
respect to [deletion][unclear]Sulphuric[/unclear] Acid[/deletion] Acids in
a high degree with respect
[underline]to [chemical]chemical_315|oxalic acid[/chemical][/underline], & it forms
a difficultly soluble compound
with this substance.-
- Now if [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] be made
negative, by bringing it under
proper circumstances in the
[chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] circuit, it will be
found no longer possessed
of its power of uniting
to y[superscript]e[/superscript] acid Matter; but on
the contrary -[unclear]All[/unclear] [insertion]matter[/insertion] will
be repelled by it.
[short horizontal rule]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
It is necessary for me to
note "what however is known
by most of my audience-.
That paper tinged with blue
[chemical]chemical_329|Litmus[/chemical] becomes red by the

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00021|dnp02d321pp|73411423[/page]
action of an acid & [deletion]pap[/deletion] that
paper tinged yellow with
turmeric becomes of a bright
brown on the contact of [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
or any other alkaline matter.
- And in consequence I shall employ
these as tests [deletion]of[/deletion] in the
experiment.-
- Now as the acid is naturally
[deletion]positive[/deletion] Negative if it refuses to
combine with the alkaline
Earth rendered likewise negative,-
The point of rest which we
might expect it to find
is [underline]the positive[/underline] [underline]surface[/underline] in the
fluid. - And this actually
happens - On examining we
shall find it to be the
fact
[underline]Instance[/underline]
It has passed through the
water, it has been Attracted
by the [underline]positive wire[/underline].

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00022|dnp02d322pp|73411425[/page]
If the converse of the experiment
be made & the [deletion]alkaline[/deletion]acid matter
be rendered [deletion]positive [insertion]negative[/insertion][/deletion] [insertion]positive[/insertion] an analogous
result will be obtained - It
will refuse to combine with
the [deletion]acid[/deletion] [insertion]alkali which will be repelled[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] will be[/deletion]
[deletion]attract[/deletion] from it. & being [insertion]itself[/insertion] naturally
positive will be attracted by
the negative surface.
- [underline]Instance[/underline]
Instance.
Again - Metals are naturally
positive with regard to the
constituent parts of Acids.-
Thus [chemical]chemical_201|[deletion]zinc[/deletion][/chemical] [insertion][chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical][/insertion] is [deletion]negative[/deletion] Positive
with regard to [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric[line]Acid[/chemical] - & between the
two Bodies in their natural
state there is a strong
chemical action; but if

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00023|dnp02d323pp|73411426[/page]
[deletion][chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical],[/deletion] [insertion]the [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical][/insertion] be made negative it
[underline]refuses to[/underline] dissolve in the
acid if there is a proper
Balance of power-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Now were its natural
positive Electricity to be
increased it would dissolve
in it more rapidly.
[short horizontal rule]
[underline]Instance[/underline]. -
- |_ By the same means as those
which will prevent the union
of Bodies naturally so attractive
of each other may the compounds
consisting of them be decomposed
- Thus if a Salt formed
[deletion]consisting[/deletion] of an alkali or an
[insertion]alkaline Earth[/insertion] & an acid, be placed in
the [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] circuit, the alkaline

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00024|dnp02d324pp|73411428[/page]
matter will be repelled from
the positive Surface & the
[deletion]alkaline[/deletion] acid matter from the
negative surface.- & the alkaline
Matter will be collected round
the [deletion]positive[/deletion] [insertion]negative[/insertion] surface & the
[deletion]alkaline[/deletion] [insertion]acid[/insertion] Matter round the
[deletion]negative[/deletion] [insertion]positive[/insertion] surface so that
a complete decomposition
will be at last produced
[short horizontal rule]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- In a Metallic Salt 
exposed to the electrical
action an analogous effect
will occur.
The Metal will separate
at the neg: surface the
acid at the positive -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[underline]instance[/underline] Tongue

[page]25|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00025|dnp02d325pp|73411429[/page]
These facts distinctly shew that
[underline]Chemical attractions[/underline] & electrical
powers exist together & are
modified & destroyed at the
same time . - [deletion]And[/deletion] There can
be no stricter demonstration
required of their intimate
connection: & the inference
that they may depend upon
one & the same property
of Matter [deletion]is fairly warranted.[/deletion]
will I hope be considered
as not made hastily or
prematurely.-. Even though
it perfectly coincides with the
phaenomena, & was not
not a suggestion of the mind
[misc]misc_753|A priori[/misc]; but flowed irresistably

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00026|dnp02d326pp|73411431[/page]
from the facts yet still
I do not wish it to
be considered in any other
light than as a probable
Hypothesis - |_ New discoveries
may possibly connect
all these principles which
we now call general
with some more extended
ones -. To the early
chemists salt & oil
& water were [underline]elements[/underline], to
us they are compounds.-
Our various [insertion]species of[/insertion] attractions may
all [insertion]possibly[/insertion] be resolved into one
grand power.- To speak
positively of the nature
of objects which we have
as yet seen only in the
twilight would be presumptuous.

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00027|dnp02d327pp|73411433[/page]
& whoever has attended to the
progress of science cannot
but feel [underline]humbled[/underline] as to
his powers of speculative discussion.-
- It would have been affected, however
not to have brought forward
the opinion, not to have shewn
the facts on which it rests
[deletion]is founded[/deletion].- It will at
least be found to assert the
Memory & to facilitate new
applications of Electricity. |_ Should
it hereafter be established as
a Theory. it will undoubtedly
be a great pleasure to me; but
should it be overturned I shall
scarcely have cause for regret
for I am convinced that in
this case [deletion]I am convinced[/deletion] some
more enlightened knowledge would
arise something more worthy of
permanency.-

[page]28|MS-DAVY-10263-000-00028|dnp02d328pp|73411434[/page]
[deletion][unclear]Almost In all most the[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]In all the[/insertion] experiments made
to elucidate chemical attraction,
in [deletion][unclear]almost[/unclear] instance of almost[/deletion] all
instances of true combination,
there is a change of temperature
& in the greatest number of
cases a considerable production
of Heat.-
- This [unclear]in[/unclear] the common notion of
the Materiality of Heat of its being
a peculiar subtile fluid interfused
[deletion]amongst[/deletion] [insertion]through[/insertion] the pores of bodies or
combined with their particles.-
has been explained by
supposing [unclear]"[/unclear]that by the
approximation [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]approximat[unclear]e[/unclear][/deletion] of the [deletion][unclear]Parts[/unclear][/deletion]
Elements of Bodies, the Heat

case being regarded as mechanical
& in the other chemical
However plausible this opinion
may be that [insertion]flowing from[/insertion]
the electrical hypothesis of affinity
will not be found to be less
So - & it offers an adequate
& simple explanation of the
phaenomena.-
- When the two electricities
annihilate or come into equilibrium
with each other you have
X

ignition [insertion]in the acting bodies[/insertion] are the consequences.-
