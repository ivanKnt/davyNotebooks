to [underline]the positive surface[/underline]. - but
when the positive electricity
is so strong as not only
to ballance the excess of
the negative energy but likewise
to bring into equilibrium
the whole original [insertion]negative[/insertion] energy
of the oxygene; in that case
the result will be different
& the acid will be decomposed,
into oxygene & Sulphur, & in
as we find it - by this intinsely
intensely powerful combination
