combination of Oxygene & Nitrogene
assumed to be positive &
negative & when it is
placed under proper circumstances
in the Voltaic circuit, it
is resolved into these substances
the oxygene separating at
the positive pole - the Nitrogene
at the negative pole.
- You witnessed in a former
lecture the combustion, of
[underline]charcoal in oxygene gas[/underline] - This
was a true solution of the
solid in the aeriform body
& the [underline]result[/underline] was [deletion]an [underline]aeriform[/underline][/deletion] [insertion][underline]gaseous[/underline][/insertion]
[underline]acid[/underline] which is composed
of about 28 parts Charcoal
& 72 oxygene in the Hundred.
- From its aeriform Nature
it being a [underline][underline]nonconductor[/underline][/underline], its decomposition
