with respect to oxygene may yet
have different energies with
respect to each other as is
the case with other combustible
Bodies - & hence not being
repellent of each other a
triple union may under
certain circumstances take
place.
- The compound acids
by high powers are decomposed
like the [underline]simple ones[/underline]: - The
two [underline][underline]combustible bases[/underline][/underline], the
Positive bases with respect
to oxygene separating at
the negative surfaces. -

By experiments of this kind
the[deletion]ir[/deletion] composition [insertion]of all the vegetable acids[/insertion] might be
easily ascertained. - In such
as have been accurately examined
the quantity of oxygene predominates
