we can scarcely [deletion]exp[/deletion] suppose that
[underline]the energy[/underline] of 1/4 of oxygene
should be sufficient to neutralize
the energy of three fourths of
Iron. - We might naturally
expect then the oxide
would display an excess
of the [underline]energy of the[/underline]
[underline]Iron[/underline] -
Oxide of Iron is positive
with regard to [underline]acids[/underline]
& when a salt containing
an acid & oxide of Iron
is acted on by a feeble
power not sufficient to
separate the Iron in a
metallic state, [underline]oxide[/underline] of
[underline]Iron[/underline] collects round
the negative surface. -
