explains the affinity of an oxide
for an acid. - which is always
[underline]however weak[/underline].
. .The acid possesses an excess
of negative energy, the oxide of
[underline]Positive[/underline]. - these energies come in
equilibrium & a new compound
is the result. -
-: The combustion of the Metals
in general is attended with
a very considerable emission of
light & heat: but in the atmosphere
it does not continue in the
same manner as the combustion
of the common inflammable bodies
because neither the metals themselves
nor the products of their combustion
are in any high degree volatile. -
& the oxide forming a coating
upon the surface defends
the interior from the action
of air - It is for this
