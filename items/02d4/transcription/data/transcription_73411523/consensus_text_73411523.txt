reason that a thick piece of
iron will not continue to
burn even in oxygene gas
but from a thin piece
the oxide is thrown off. -
- The power of continuing
inflammation is nearly
proportional to the volatility
of the metals - Thus Zinc
& Arsenic after being once
inflamed will continue to
burn. - Instance
- There is another reason
why when oxides not volatile
appear in combustion they tend
to stop the process.- they are
nonconductors of electricity -
whereas intensely heated elastic
fluids are conductors - Hence
if combustion depends upon
upon the equilibrium between
the two energies, this equilibrium
could not take place through
the medium of a nonconductor
