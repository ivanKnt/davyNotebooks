Amongst the various phaenomena
of Chemistry no one has occupied
so much Attention amongst
Philosophers as that of combustion
|_The brilliancy of the appearances
in this process[deletion]es[/deletion]- Its connection
with most of the common
wants of life & with many
of the nobler arts - The immense
resources [deletion]that has given bestowed by it[/deletion] [insertion]provided by it[/insertion]
for civilized man, have all
contributed to render it a
highly interesting object of
discussion, [deletion]&[/deletion] in every scientific
School the doctrines belonging
to it have formed a distinguishing
feature [deletion]of[/deletion] in the Philosophy of
the Age.-

[page]4||dnp02d402pp|73411483[/page]
[deletion]The[/deletion] The ancients whose vivid
imaginations whose sublime powers
of generalization were never
enlightened by experiment, contented
themselves by considering [underline]fire[/underline] as
a certain etherial principle
above common bodies;. loosely
attached, or unwillingly confined
to them having a constant
tendency to quit the earth
and ascend upwards; a
[underline]visitor[/underline] of this terrestrial system
but a [underline][underline]native[/underline][/underline] of a higher
system. -
- In the early chemical
Philosophy of Beccher & of
Stahl, the Heat & light
develloped in combustion
were regarded as dependent
upon the [insertion]disengagement of[/insertion] peculiar inflammable
principle fixed in all
bodies capable of burning -
of a

[page]5||dnp02d403pp|73411484[/page]
This [insertion]imaginary[/insertion]active element was characterized
under the name of Phlogiston.
& for nearly a century its
empire was almost universal
in the laboratories /_ & nothing
was heard of but combustible
bodies & salts & processes
of phlogistication & dephlogistication
.-. About the time that this
notion was first brought forwards
two english Philosophers had
indeed advanced a much more
beautiful & correct opinion
namely that combustion was
owing to a union of a part
of the air [insertion]of the Atmosphere[/insertion] with the combustible
matter & that the fire arose
from the condensation of this air;
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] matter[/deletion]
but this happy illustration at
that era met with no support
& for nearly a century its
in the laboratories /_& nothing
was heard of but combustible

[page]6||dnp02d404pp|73411486[/page]
physics & chemistry as yet had
no common bond of relation;
& the revival of the
hypothesis of Hooke & Mayow
was reserved for modern
times to to be the chief
glory of the school of
Lavoisier. -
- Since the antiphlogistic
Chemistry has become popular
a modification of the pneumatic
idea of combustion has
been develloped. - /_It is
said that the [underline]Heat[/underline]
arises from the aeriform
matter absorbed & the [underline]light[/underline]
from the combustible body.
- This the speculation of
Macquer adopted by Leonhardi

[page]7||dnp02d405pp|73411487[/page]
& by Gren has been defended
with much ingenuity in one of y[superscript]e[/superscript]
-... The reasoning upon the
phaenomenon flowing from the
electrochemical facts differs
materially from all - The
process is considered like
all other chemical processes
as a fact of electrical
action; as the result of
the equilibrium between the
energies of two Bodies naturally
in opposite electrical states. -
- Acids & alkalies which are
respectively negative & positive
produce heat by their union & are
[deletion]by[/deletion] [insertion]supposed to produce it by their[/insertion] electrical attraction &
[deletion]chemical[/deletion] adherence. - But oxygene
or pure air & inflammable bodies
latest [insertion]& best of our[/insertion] elementary treatises; -

[page]8||dnp02d406pp|73411489[/page]
are conceived to be in more
exalted states of Electricity &
hence during the exertion of
their energies, during their
attractions, [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] Heat results[/deletion]
[deletion]but also fire[/deletion] a much more
intense degree of Heat results,
in the form of fire of Heat
& light. -
- This idea it would ill
become me to [deletion]bring forward[/deletion] suggest in
any other form than as a
matter of enquiry. That it
in conformable to many of
the facts you have
already witnessed;- You
have seen that it harmonizes
with the general hypothesis
of chemical affinity - It
will now be rigidly
analysed in its relation

[page]9||dnp02d407pp|73411491[/page]

to the particular results presented
by inflamed bodies, in its relation
to what are called processes of
acidification & oxydation. -
-.- [underline]Sulphur[/underline] it was stated
is positive with respect to
the metals - & [underline][underline]oxygene[/underline][/underline] has
been inferred to be negative
with respect to all other bodies
but Sulphur when heated in
contact with [underline]air, burns[/underline], &
this phaenomenon must be
referred [deletion]t[/deletion]according to the
notion that has been stated
to the union of a positive
with a negative body, of Sulphur
with oxygene. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Now here is an absorption of
[underline]oxygene[/underline], let us examine what

[page]10||dnp02d408pp|73411492[/page]
results.
Instance
It is an acid it is
a [underline]new body[/underline].  It tastes
like a solution of oil of
Vitriol in water & like
that substance it will
render turbid a solution
of Barytes. -
- The results of the
combustion of Sulphur, then
is Sulphuric Acid, /_but
if this substance be formed
by two materials, one naturally
positive the other naturally
negative, "these materials
by a certain high electrical
power acting under proper
circumstances, [deletion]out[/deletion] ought to
be capable of being separated
that is there may be found a
[deletion]a positive[/deletion] surface [insertion]artificially made positive[/insertion] capable

[page]11||dnp02d409pp|73411494[/page]

of attracting the Body naturally
possessed of the negative energy
from the body naturally positive
& vice versa:-
- - Now [deletion]that we shall[/deletion] [insertion]let sulphuric acid[/insertion]
[deletion]find[/deletion] be connected in the
Voltaic circuit - What
happens - - Why exactly
What ought to happen.-
[Horizontal rule]
- [underline]Instance[/underline]
oxygene at pos. Sulphur at
negative.-
So that in this instance
the demonstration is very strict.-
-. But if Sulphuric acid is composed
of two substances one positive
the other negatives it may
be asked, why does it itself
exhibit a negative energy; why

[page]12||dnp02d410pp|73411496[/page]
is it by a certain power
of electricity itself attracted
to the positive surface without
decomposition?
To answer this question a [deletion]very[/deletion]
satisfactory answer may I hope
be given - These difficulties
may be easily removed &
the solution of them leads
to the devellopment of some
of the more refined laws of
Electrochemical action.
- If we put [deletion]a glass[/deletion] pieces of plate
glass one considerably larger
than the other be brought in
contact & one be positively
& the other negatively electrified
they will adhere; though it is
evident that the large glass
will be electrified in a higher
degree than the small one;

[page]13||dnp02d411pp|73411497[/page]
-& if by contact [insertion]of a conductor[/insertion] the two electricities
be brought into equilibrium, there
will be [underline]an excess[/underline] of that electrically
existing on the [underline]largest surface[/underline]. -
- . Now Sulphuric acid consists of
a larger proportion of oxygene
than [underline]Sulphur[/underline] - [insertion]Qu instance[/insertion] /_& though to a
certain extent the negative
energy of the oxygene is ballanced
by that of the sulphur, yet
still [deletion]the whole[/deletion] in the whole resulting
compound there will be an
excess of negative energy. - &
hence; when the acid is [insertion]feebly[/insertion] acted on
by [deletion][unclear]a weak[/unclear][/deletion] positive & negative
electricity either in consequence
of it being diffused through a
bad conductor as [deletion]water[/deletion] [insertion]in a diluted solution in water[/insertion] or
[deletion]in[/deletion] being [deletion]exposed to[/deletion] in the [deletion]action[/deletion]
circuit of a small combination -
- The artificial [insertion]positive[/insertion] electricity will be

[page]14||dnp02d412pp|73411499[/page]
sufficient only to [deletion]neutralize[/deletion]
[deletion]it[/deletion] neutralize the [underline]excess of negative[/underline]
energy of the oxygene ie that
energy which is not ballanced
by the energy of the Sulphur
[deletion]but when[/deletion] & hence the acid will be
[underline]attracted[/underline] without decomposition
to [underline]the positive surface[/underline]. - but
when the positive electricity
is so strong as not only
to ballance the excess of
the negative energy but likewise
to bring into equilibrium
the whole original [insertion]negative[/insertion] energy
of the oxygene; in that case
the result will be different
& the acid will be decomposed,
into oxygene & Sulphur, & in
as we find it - by this intinsely
intensely powerful combination

[page]15||dnp02d413pp|73411500[/page]
such a case the elements obtained
will be primary & not secondary. -
- In a similar manner we
may reason upon the phaenomena
presented by the combustion
of [underline]Phosphorus[/underline]. -
- Phosphorus is supposed to
be [underline]positive[/underline] with regard to
[underline]oxygene[/underline];- - They attract each
other [deletion]when the[/deletion] [insertion]with great power for y[superscript]e[/superscript] particles of the[/insertion] phosphorus

of motion as to be capable

Hence combustion & the formation

that the positive energy

- When Phosphoric acid in weak

applied to [insertion]the [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] of[/deletion] explanation of[/insertion] this phaenomenon
as to the explanation of the
attraction of sulphuric acid.
-. Phosphoric acid contains more
oxygene than phosphorus, the
negative energy is predominant
in it -- & when [underline]this excess[/underline]
of energy only, is ballanced an
attraction of the [deletion]whole[/deletion]
acid to the positive surface
takes place & there is no
decomposition -
... It will be unnecessary to
multiply instances to a greater
extent. - The same [deletion]phaenomena[/deletion] [insertion]laws[/insertion]
will apply; generally to all
process of combustion or [insertion]of the[/insertion] combination
[insertion]of two bodies[/insertion] in which acid matter is formed
& to the [underline][deletion]formation[/deletion] [insertion]generation[/insertion] & decomposition[/underline]

assumed to be positive &
negative & when it is
placed under proper circumstances
in the Voltaic circuit, it
is resolved into these substances
the oxygene separating at
the positive pole - the Nitrogene
at the negative pole.
- You witnessed in a former
lecture the combustion, of
[underline]charcoal in oxygene gas[/underline] - This

- These are all composed of
Carbon & Hydrogene in different
proportions but with an
excess of oxygene; & hence
they all display the negative
energy, /_& are attracted
by weak powers to the

[page]21||dnp02d419pp|73411510[/page]
with respect to oxygene may yet
have different energies with
respect to each other as is
the case with other combustible
Bodies - & hence not being
repellent of each other a
triple union may under
certain circumstances take
place.
- The compound acids
by high powers are decomposed
like the [underline]simple ones[/underline]: - The
two [underline][underline]combustible bases[/underline][/underline], the
Positive bases with respect
to oxygene separating at
the negative surfaces. -
[short horizontal rule]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
By experiments of this kind
the[deletion]ir[/deletion] composition [insertion]of all the vegetable acids[/insertion] might be
easily ascertained. - In such
as have been accurately examined
the quantity of oxygene predominates

[page]22||dnp02d420pp|73411512[/page]
over the quantity of [underline]inflammable[/underline]
matter. - So that it
might be laid down as
a principle as far as
our knowledge extends"
that in compound acid
matter there is always
in excess of negative
energy, & a proportion
of oxygene more than sufficient
to ballance, by its natural
electricity, the Electricity
of the inflammable base. -
- /_According to these ideas
the word [underline]Oxygene[/underline] is less
objectionable than it would
seem to be at the first
view of the new facts. -
- For it may signify either
generating acids or produced
from acids - Oxus being acid

[page]23||dnp02d421pp|73411514[/page]
& ynionic to produce. - And
oxygene is both evolved from

part of all those that have
been accurately examined. -
Were a new nomenclature to be
formed, undoubtedly a much
more perfect word might
be [deletion]promoted[/deletion] [insertion]supplied[/insertion].- for we shall
hereafter find "that oxygene
exists in alkalies as well
as in acids; - /_The principle
of the French Chemists
in naming bodies from a

not be exclusive is undoubtedly
illogical - but when a

- The [underline]electrochemical operations[/underline]

& the analysis of their compounds
-: You saw the combustion of
Iron in oxygene gas - The
Iron is highly positive, oxygene
is negative " there is a rapid
combination a powerful attraction
connected with brilliant heat
& light [deletion]- Now if we examine[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]this process minutely[/underline][/deletion]
I do not repeat this
[underline]experiment[/underline] for the sake of
producing a [underline][underline]brilliant[/underline][/underline] [underline][underline]result[/underline][/underline]
but to point out a most
important circumstance intimately
connected with the whole Elec[superscript]l[/superscript].
theory. - [deletion]of[/deletion] 40 . 30
Oxygene gas only 25
parts for [underline]100[/underline].
- Now as the Iron is highly positive

[page]26||dnp02d424pp|73411520[/page]
we can scarcely [deletion]exp[/deletion] suppose that
[underline]the energy[/underline] of 1/4 of oxygene
should be sufficient to neutralize
the energy of three fourths of
Iron. - We might naturally
expect then the oxide
would display an excess
of the [underline]energy of the[/underline]
[underline]Iron[/underline] -
Oxide of Iron is positive
with regard to [underline]acids[/underline]
& when a salt containing
an acid & oxide of Iron
is acted on by a feeble
power not sufficient to
separate the Iron in a
metallic state, [underline]oxide[/underline] of
[underline]Iron[/underline] collects round
the negative surface. -
- Instance
And this fact beautifully

[page]27||dnp02d425pp|73411522[/page]
explains the affinity of an oxide
for an acid. - which is always
[underline]however weak[/underline].
. .The acid possesses an excess
of negative energy, the oxide of
[underline]Positive[/underline]. - these energies come in
equilibrium & a new compound
is the result. -
-: The combustion of the Metals
in general is attended with
a very considerable emission of
light & heat: but in the atmosphere
it does not continue in the
same manner as the combustion
of the common inflammable bodies
because neither the metals themselves
nor the products of their combustion
are in any high degree volatile. -
& the oxide forming a coating
upon the surface defends
the interior from the action
of air - It is for this

[page]28||dnp02d426pp|73411523[/page]
reason that a thick piece of
iron will not continue to
burn even in oxygene gas
but from a thin piece
the oxide is thrown off. -
- The power of continuing
inflammation is nearly
proportional to the volatility
of the metals - Thus Zinc
& Arsenic after being once
inflamed will continue to
burn. - Instance
- There is another reason
why when oxides not volatile
appear in combustion they tend
to stop the process.- they are
nonconductors of electricity -
whereas intensely heated elastic
fluids are conductors - Hence
if combustion depends upon
upon the equilibrium between
the two energies, this equilibrium
could not take place through
the medium of a nonconductor

[page]29||dnp02d427pp|73411525[/page]
though it would take place through
the medium of a conducting body
-. The [underline]products[/underline] of [underline]Metallic[/underline]
combustion in all cases accurately
examined contain an excess of
the metallic base; & all that
I have carefully tried exhibit
the positive energy with regard
to acids -.
There is a very [deletion]elegant[/deletion] [insertion]simple[/insertion]
method furnished by the Voltaic
apparatus of demonstrating the
small proportion of oxygene absorbed
in metallic combustion. -
& Instance.
elegant mode of general proportion
- Hence it is that like the
oxide of Iron they are all
capable of combining with
acids; but both the negative

[page]30||dnp02d428pp|73411527[/page]
energy of acids & the positive
energy of metallic oxides; being
only the excess above the

Now how is this explained
according to the electrical
Hypothesis?
Zinc is positive with regard
to copper & therefore must be

[page]35||dnp02d433pp|73411536[/page]
more positive with respect to
oxygene & acids - Hence its
natural electricity will more
perfectly [deletion]annihi[/deletion] bring into equilibrium
the Electricity of the constituents
of the acid; & the Zinc [deletion]will[/deletion]
[deletion]enter[/deletion] must enter into combination
& the copper must be deposited?
- And the demonstration of
this theory is that of the Zinc
[deletion]copper[/deletion] be made artificially [deletion]more[/deletion] negative
[deletion]positive that the Zinc[/deletion] in
[deletion]the [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] in a high degree.
Then it will be [underline]precipitated [deletion]Zinc[/deletion][/underline] even
[insertion]upon copper[/insertion] as may be easily shewn.
.Instance. -
And it is a general & curious
Law. That the Electrical
Energy of every metal in its
natural state is the measure of

[page]36||dnp02d434pp|73411538[/page]
its power of precipitation. -
Thus Zinc being the most positive
amongst all the [underline]common[/underline] [underline]metals[/underline]
precipitates them from their

Tin precipitates all the metals

to all of which it is

be made intensely positive
artificially & then in
this exalted state of
power it is capable
of precipitating all the
