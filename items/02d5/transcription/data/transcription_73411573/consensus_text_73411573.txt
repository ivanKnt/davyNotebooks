chemical analogies had been
observed at an early era
of [deletion][unclear]([/unclear][/deletion] Experimental Science.-
The metallic oxides were
called metallic earths or
calces.-
- So strong was the idea
that Barytes Strontites
& Lime were metallic oxides;
that it was asserted by
Tondi & Ruprecht that they
were reducible in a [deletion]strong[/deletion] high
Heat by charcoal; but
in this instance a vivid
imagination misrepresented the
results of [deletion]observation[/deletion] experiment
The metals obtained were
proved by accurate processes
to be derived from other
materials from the crucibles
