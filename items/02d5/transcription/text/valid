Oxygene then may be considered
as existing [deletion][unclear]in[/unclear][/deletion] & as forming
an element in all the true
alkalies; & that substance
which according to the ideas
of Lavoisier is the acidifying
principle, may now [deletion]be[/deletion] likewise be
called the principle of alkalescence
- Alkalies [deletion][unclear]then[/unclear][/deletion] contain [deletion]an excess[/deletion] a great
[deletion]of[/deletion] excess of combustible matter.
Acids a great excess of oxygenous
Matter.-
- Alkalies display [deletion]the excess[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] the energy of the base
& are positive.-
Acids display [deletion]the excess of[/deletion] the
energy of oxygene & are negative.-
[deletion]And hence the two classes of[/deletion]
[deletion]bodies are capable of entering[/deletion]
[deletion]into new combinations[/deletion]
The two electricities are capable

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00004|dnp02d502pp|73411568[/page]
of being brought into new
equilibrium. |_ and hence result
new combinations & classes
of bodies comparatively inactive
with respect to energy, the
various [underline]neutral salts[/underline]; which
possess as their constituents
acids & alkalies.
In proportion as [deletion]the simpler[/deletion]
the elements of Matter are [deletion]develloped[/deletion] [insertion]simple[/insertion]
so in proportion [deletion]is the[/deletion] are
their powers of combination
or their electrical energies
more exalted. - Acids
& alkalies [deletion]which are compound[/deletion]
[deletion]Species of Matter[/deletion] have been
till very lately the prime
agents of chemical decomposition?
How much then may we
[deletion]not[/deletion] expect that our powers

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00005|dnp02d503pp|73411570[/page]
of analysis will be exalted, now
that be capable of applying
their undecompounded materials
as instruments of experiment?
- . Besides the true alkalies
& the Metallic oxides the composition
of which has been the subject
of consideration, there exists
another class of Bodies which
are attracted by the [underline]negative[/underline]
[underline]surface[/underline], These are the
alkaline Earths & the true
Earths. -
The Alkaline Earths are
Lime Barytes, Strontites &
Magnesia .-
The true Earths are Alumine
Silex, Glucine Yttria &
Zircon .
- You can on a [unclear]firmer[/unclear]

occasion that the alkaline
earths separate in their

surface; & the case is
the same with the common
Earths though they are 
acted upon with much
less energy. -
- [deletion] The Earths like the metallic[/deletion]
[deletion]oxides.[/deletion]
- . The Earths in their physical
& chemical properties likewise
as well as in their electrical
relations form a class of
bodies intermediate as
it were between the alkalies

[deletion]earths which extends to Strontites[/deletion]
[deletion]lime, Magnesia, alumine[/deletion]
- Barytes in its weight & poisonous
nature resembles a metallic
oxide.- In its solubility in
water, its taste & its action
upon vegetable colours. it
has points of analogy to
potash & Soda .- .-
- Strontites, lime & Magnesia
connect as it were by similar
properties "the [underline]Alkaline[/underline] &
the [underline]common earths[/underline] , at the
head of which may be placed
alumine - & the common
Earths agree with [deletion]the[/deletion] most
of the metallic oxides [deletion][unclear]in colour[/unclear][/deletion]
insolubility in water, in having
no taste & in being [deletion]perfect[/deletion]
[unclear]conconductors[/unclear] of Electricity. -
- These common physical &

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00008|dnp02d505pp|73411573[/page]
chemical analogies had been
observed at an early era
of [deletion][unclear]([/unclear][/deletion] Experimental Science.-
The metallic oxides were
called metallic earths or
calces.-
- So strong was the idea
that Barytes Strontites
& Lime were metallic oxides;
that it was asserted by
Tondi & Ruprecht that they
were reducible in a [deletion]strong[/deletion] high
Heat by charcoal; but
in this instance a vivid
imagination misrepresented the
results of [deletion]observation[/deletion] experiment
The metals obtained were
proved by accurate processes
to be derived from other
materials from the crucibles

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00009|dnp02d506pp|73411575[/page]
or the agents employed for reduction?
- .. - The new evidence from the
electrical powers of the alkaline
[deletion]Earths[/deletion] & common Earths is not
merely supported by these [insertion]resemblances[/insertion] [deletion]analogies[/deletion]
[deletion]it[/deletion] but likewise rests upon some
facts, which though [deletion]they [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
of [underline]a nature[/underline] [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] unfits
them for a distinct exhibition
are yet nearly conclusive
as to the [deletion]general[/deletion] question. -
- The Earths in general are
nonconductors & they are not
capable of being fused by any
common methods of exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. - They
consequently present much greater
difficulties , than the fixed
alkalies to the electrical
processes of decomposition -
When Barytes Strontites of
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Lime of Magnesia are slightly

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00010|dnp02d507pp|73411577[/page]
moistened with water, & exposed
to the [insertion]intense[/insertion] electrical action of
the Battery - there is a
considerable effect - Oxygene
is develloped at the positive
surface & inflammable matter
which [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] forms or which
acts upon the water as
soon as it is formed
appears at the negative
surface
- [underline]Instance[/underline]
- In this instance the water
does not actually combine
so as to [unclear]fuse[/unclear] the [underline]earth[/underline]
but if these [unclear]instances[/unclear] be made
fluid by means of the
action of a minute quantity
of Boracic acid when they
are in a state of
intense ignition, In this
case substances are formed

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00011|dnp02d508pp|73411578[/page]
which burn with a deep red light
in the sphere of negative
electricity -.
Instance
by rendering [deletion]the [unclear]alkalies[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Barytes & Strontites[/insertion] [deletion]conducting[/deletion]
permeable to electricity in [deletion]by[/deletion] other
similar combinations - I have
witnessed the formation of
substances possessing the metallic
lustre; but which are [deletion]formed[/deletion] [insertion]produced[/insertion]
in such small quantities;
which burn so readily in
air [deletion]&[/deletion] decompose water
with so much energy, & are
so difficultly fusible that
they have resisted all attempts
yet made to collect them
& to exhibit them in their
perfect forms. -
- This is a subject for new
exp[superscript]t[/superscript], To triumph over these

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00012|dnp02d509pp|73411580[/page]

Since the time that I first
gained a glimpse of [deletion]these[/deletion]
[deletion]substances[/deletion] in Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. [unclear][deletion]uncontrollable[/deletion][/unclear]
circumstances have prevented
me from pursuing the [deletion]enquiry[/deletion] [insertion]subject[/insertion]

[insertion]resume it[/insertion] with [deletion]unabated[/deletion] [insertion]an[/insertion] ardor [deletion]wh[/deletion] exalted
by the interest [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] you
have expressed in the enquiry.-
[deletion]-.-.- [deletion]B[/deletion] The two classes of the[/deletion]
[deletion]Earth appear to be attracted by[/deletion]
[deletion]negative electricity in the[/deletion]
[deletion]following order as to the[/deletion]
[deletion]degrees of energy - Barytes[/deletion]
[deletion]Strontites & Lime most[/deletion]
[deletion]intensely. -. & alumine &[/deletion]

[deletion]the negative surface approach[/deletion]

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00013|dnp02d510pp|73411582[/page]
And I hope in the next season
to have the justification of
bringing before you the various results
[insertion]of investigations[/insertion] which are now unfinished-
I hope to be able to remove
Some of the many imperfections
which have belonged to
the present course.- I hope

- if we suppose the
Earths to be combinations
of highly inflammable metallic
bases with [deletion]a xxxxx[/deletion] oxygene a [deletion]number[/deletion][insertion]number[/insertion]
of [insertion]natural[/insertion] phaenomena hitherto

accounted for .-. Such an

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00014|dnp02d511pp|73411583[/page]
necessarily lead to advances in
the theory of the Earth &
would give solutions of various
mysterious facts in Geology,

with subterranean fires earthquakes

- It appears from the Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Cavendish & the observations
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Maskelyne. that the
specific gravity of the whole
Earth is at least twice
as great as that of the

alone might lead to
us to suspect that the

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00015|dnp02d512pp|73411585[/page]
be no unreasonable supposition
that the Metallic bases of these
bodies which form the 'great
part of the surface exist
in the interior & whenever
they are accidentally exposed
to air & water "exert a
violent chemical action &
undergo new combinations
-.--. The eruptions of Volcanoes
are proved by numerous
facts to be connected with
"the flowing in of water" through
some subterranean cavities; -
|_And the results of [deletion]these[/deletion] Volcanic

for the [underline]intense inflammation[/underline]

-...- Amongst the various mysterious
circumstances connected with the
fall of [underline]meteoric stones[/underline], no
one has more perplexed Naturalists
than their ignition & apparent
combustion in the atmosphere
& the vivid Light they emit.
- But these phaenomena may
be easily accounted for
on [deletion]an[/deletion] a hypothesis which
flows from the ideas that
have been just develloped-
-. The meteoric stones all of
them consist [insertion]principally[/insertion] of the Earths
in a loose state of aggregation:
& if we suppose "that they
come into our atmosphere
in a metallic state; their

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10265-000-00018|dnp02d515pp|73411590[/page]
combustion would be a necessary
effect of their combination
with oxygene; & this combustion
would become more vivid
in their descent, in proportion
as they passed through a
denser air. -
-- All the accounts of the
great meteors which have
been best observed are
conformable to such a
notion - & that which
passed over part of N. America
on the 14th of december
1807; offered appearances
which can hardly be
explained in any other

- [deletion]With[/deletion] [insertion]Should[/insertion] this Hypothesis [insertion]be admitted,[/insertion] the origin
of these bodies [insertion]however[/insertion] will be still
as much an enigma as

known is that they

& mere travellers in this; -
(but from what source they
are derived, for what purposes
designed & by what laws
they are governed, we shall
probably long remain ignorant:-.
- The two classes of the
Earths; the alkaline & the
common Earths appear to be
attracted by negative electricity
in the following order as
to the degrees of energy -
Barytes Strontites & Lime
most intensely - Magnesia
less intensely. ; & alumine &
Silex though they find their

it very slowly and collect round
it only in small quantities
- If a legitimate inference
can be drawn from other like
cases in which the composition
of the acting substances is known
- We should conclude; that
of the Earths - Barytes Strontites
& Zinc contained the most
inflammable matter. - & Magnesia
& alumine & Silex the least.;
(& if these bodies be binary
compounds that the quantity
of the combustible basis in
all of the exceeds that

since there is no possibility that

but their elastic form is no
proof that their nature is not
metallic -. Mercury, Zinc, &
Arsenic [deletion][unclear]would[/unclear] be[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] all aeriform

& at this temperature as I
have [deletion]been able to prove[/deletion] [insertion]found[/insertion] by several
experiments, they are like the

peculiar species of inflammable

And if such generalizations

& a grand philosophy would
be the result.-
- From the combination of
different quantities of one

quantities of two or three
species of ponderable matter
we might conceive all
the diversity of material
substances to owe their
constitution - And as the

- These kinds of conjectural
