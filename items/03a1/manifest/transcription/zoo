In the Course of lectures which
I had the honour of delivering
to You this spring in develloping
the general doctrines of Chemistry
I [deletion]alluded[/deletion] often had occasion to refer
to their connection with Electricity
It is my present object to enter
explicitly upon this subject; &
to examine minutely the relations
between these two great departments
of natural knowledge, which
as I hope to be able to
demonstrate to You, though
they appear to be separate &
distinct are but as Scions
from the same stock when when
profoundly examined, [insertion][deletion]di[/deletion] are discovered to have a common[/insertion] [deletion]having the[/deletion]
[deletion]same[/deletion] origin & [insertion]to be[/insertion] governed by [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]same[/deletion] [insertion]analogous[/insertion] laws._

[page]2||dnp03a102pp|75689235[/page]
 :I shall have to offer to You various
new experiments & new illustrations.-
You will I trust find that in
the last year [deletion]even,[/deletion] some progress
has been made towards a more
complete arrangement of
the facts, & that Science
has neither slept, nor been
slow in its progress- The
approbation which you so kindly
bestowed upon early & imperfect
labours has not failed to
be a stimulus to what
I hope are better exertions
& I trust it will be found
that any encouragement offered
to experimental Science will
never be inefficacious or
vain.-
 -I shall bring forward some novel
views, [deletion]I [unclear]shall[/unclear] likewise[/deletion] which will

[page]3||dnp03a103pp|75689236[/page]
necessarily modify the existing classifications
33
of chemistry:- I shall be obliged
to question doctrines, which hitherto
have been justly regarded as supported
by strong evidence; but I shall
question them only on the authority
of facts [deletion]upon[/deletion] which You
will have an opportunity of
witnessing & which may guide
you in your decision.-
Should I be in error I may
hope to be enlightened by the
sagacity of men of science who
[deletion]who honour this[/deletion] honour this theatre by their
presence. Any corrections" I shall
receive without [deletion]any[/deletion] a sentiment
of uneasiness, rather with pleasure.
[deletion]& I hope I shal not be accused[/deletion]
[deletion]of an unworthy sentiment of[/deletion]
[deletion]self approbation in saying[/deletion]
feeble indeed must that mind
be that would shrink from
discussion; that would rest on

[page]4||dnp03a104pp|75689237[/page]
the authority of the School, that
would prefer a transient reputation
[deletion]to the [unclear]interests of[/unclear][/deletion] founded upon exclusive Knowledge
to the great & permanent cause
of truth. -
- .-. I [insertion]feel[/insertion] trust however that
the novel opinions [deletion]which[/deletion] I
shall [deletion]bring forward[/deletion] advance will not
be opposed merely because they
were unexpected, or rejected
because they are extraordinary.
- Their circumstances [insertion]necessarily[/insertion] belong to
the nature, of the progression
of Sciences - |_ That change
in Hypothesis, which is sometimes
urged as in reproach against
experimental knowledge is in
fact its glory. |_ New objects

experiments & observations which
form the bond of union between
Electrical & chemical powers, I shall

commence with ancient & familiar
instances, - I shall endeavour
to releive the tediousness
of discussion by some historical
 details & some account
of the applications of the
principles to phaenomena in
Nature & in Art.- |_ In

enquiry, in laying the foundations;

as the enquiry advances, there
will be ample room for
illustrations which will appeal
to the senses, & Which I
trust will be curious & impressive. -
- The nature of the subject requires
that we should study [insertion]the primary & feeble effect[/insertion] [deletion]powers[/deletion]

of their accumulation & of their
great & extensive agencies.-
-..|_The first electrical effects
observed were those produced
by amber.- The Greek name
of which ελεκτρον has [deletion]been[/deletion] given
the denomination of the Science;
- The only facts known to the
ancients were that Amber &
some of the precious stones
attracted light bodies when
heated or rubbed-. The property
was supposed by them to be
specific & mysterious & belonging
to a very few substances
only.-
. It was [deletion][insertion]not[/insertion][/deletion] was in the 16 century [deletion]only[/deletion]
& in this Country that the
first philosophical investigation
of Electricity was made- D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Gilbert of Colchester in his treatise

[page]8||dnp03a108pp|75689241[/page]
on the magnet published in 1600
has described the attractive powers
of a great number of substances,
Glass sealing wax, resins, gums
& most of the earthy & stoney
bodies & the supposed electrical
attraction to be a general
property of matter; & thus
contrasted with [underline]Magnetic[/underline]
[underline]attraction[/underline] which was peculiar
to bodies [deletion][unclear]only[/unclear][/deletion] containing iron.-
- Gilbert is the earliest great
Electrical Discoverer.; & even
in this advanced period of
science in this day of
which He develloped the dawn
His book is highly worthy
 of perusal. -(He has detailed
a number of experiments[deletion], of[/deletion]
which [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] apply much more
than many later ones of
greater brilliancy, to the past
principles of the Science; &

[page]9||dnp03a109pp|75689242[/page]
36
He has drawn many instructive parallels
between magnetic & electrical Attraction
- The Contemporary of [person_124][underline]Bacon[/underline][/person_124], He pursued
Science with the same exalted
spirit of [underline]enquiry[/underline], pointing at the
necessity of deducing [underline]theories[/underline] from
[underline]facts[/underline] & at once offering the
precept & exhibiting the example.
- I trust I need make no apology
for offering this tribute to the
memory of our countryman whose
[deletion]has[/deletion] works have been too much
neglected both at home &
abroad.-. Who with Gallileo, &
[insertion]his illustrious countryman[/insertion] made the first [deletion]efforts[/deletion] practical
efforts to bring them out of the
labyrinth of metalphysical subtleties
[deletion]back[/deletion] to nature & experiment - In
his latin preface He says in
word, which may be thus translated.-
- [deletion]He says[/deletion] my object is to arrange
facts founded on trials of the properties
of natural things & to give to
my subject demonstrations similar to

[page]10||dnp03a110pp|75689243[/page]
those adopted in geometry which are
the most most simple foundation
raises the most magnificent
works which by a few
propositions founded on the properties
of things belonging to the earth
enables the mind to comprehend
the structure of the Heavens -
I renounce all subtleties connected
with letters - I depend alone
on things which may be
made evident to the senses,
things which may be easily tried
- & nothing in this creating
has been done in haste
- every experiment has been
carefully repeated. -
- Gilbert has observed that the
Metals were [unclear]at[/unclear] attracted by
glass sealing wax & other bodies
when they were heated & rubbed
[unclear][deletion]x[/unclear][/deletion] but He had no idea that
the metals could themselves
become electrical & attract
each other, & other bodies.

after He wrote this was conceived to
be impossible; & the metals
were distinguished from other
bodies in [deletion]all [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] many elementary
treatises under the name of
[underline]nonelectrics[/underline] it being conceived
that it was impossible to
make them electrical without
the contact of bodies of a different
class.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bennet was the first
Person who shewed that the
Metals gained electrical powers
by contact or friction & He
was enabled to determine
this by means of an extremely
delicate instrument of his
own invention [insertion][unclear][underline]called[/underline][/unclear][/insertion] in which gold
leaf is exposed to the body
examined -; & in which by
particular artifices the Electricity
is increased. -
- One of his simplest experiments

[page]12||dnp03a112pp|75689245[/page]
was to touch a plate
of copper with the blade of
a Knife. . An effect
is found to be produced
in a slighter degree
similar to that produced
by the friction of sealing
wax.
- This discovery was published
in a distinct [insertion]treatise[/insertion] containing many
curious electrical exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] in 1789;
but it was neglected for
ten years till the singular
phaenomena comprehended
under the name of Galvanism
began to occupy the public
attention.
It had long been known &
recent exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] made by Vassali
had shewn, that the Common
[underline]electricity [deletion][unclear]m[/unclear][/deletion] produced[/underline] contractions
in the limbs of animals just
deprived of life - (Galvani

Violent contractions were produced
in the leg. - He tried other
 metals with similar effects;
& He found combinations of
metals much more efficacious
 than simple [underline]Metals[/underline].-
-: Here is the form of
a [underline]Galvanic exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/underline]

- The same effect is produced
by an [underline]electrical spark.[/underline]
- The true discovery of Galvani
was that of a delicate animal
Electrometer. - |_The conclusion
ought to have been "that
combinations of the metals
were rendered [underline]electrical by contact[/underline]

[page]14||dnp03a114pp|75689247[/page]
were formed by [deletion]the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Galvani &
his followers. - .. |_They conceived
that the Metals were merely
conductors of an [deletion][unclear]specific[/unclear][/deletion] etherial
fluid existing in the animal
 organs, .[deletion]connected with with[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]unstable[/unclear] & sensitive action.[/deletion]
& that this fluid was the
cause of irritable action -
- Innumerable Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were made
by Humboldt by Aldini by
Valli to determine the
laws by which it was governed.
-The [deletion][unclear]lo[/unclear][/deletion] highest physiological
discoveries were anticipated.

- The effect is produced upon
the gold leaf as upon the
animal organ -
The question was put beyond
a doubt - by the grand [deletion]discovery[/deletion] [insertion]invention[/insertion]
of this illustrious Philosopher
of the new electrical battery:-
-. It is to [underline]Volta[/underline] that we owe
the [deletion]late [unclear]pr[/unclear][/deletion] great progression in
the Science - And it is
wholly inconsistent with the
feeling of justice that the

[page]16||dnp03a116pp|75689249[/page]
name of Galvani should be
associated with his discoveries.
-.- Galvanism & Galvanic batteries
will I trust soon become obsolete
terms; & Voltaic electricity
& Voltaic batteries take their
place. - [deletion]Give[/deletion] Let Honour
be given where honour is
due; (but let not the
new & magnificent facts
belonging to novel discoveries
be [underline]associated[/underline] with a name
to which they bear no
relation. (Let not the
accidental observer of an
insulated [deletion][unclear]fact[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]phaenomenon[/insertion] which He
was unable to explain,
be classed before a
[underline]Philosopher[/underline] whose inventions
were the result of combination,

been as [underline]sagacious[/underline] as his

-:|_Solids were till the time
of Volta supposed to be
the only substances which
could be made electrical

excited- ; |_but Volta observed
that [underline]fluids[/underline] were possessed

Electricity therefore is not
of the same [underline]kind[/underline].
Again - I attach
these two spheres to
the same part of the system
They repel each other, we
may conclude they are
in the same state.-
- They repel each other
likewise on another part of
the Apparatus

[page]20||dnp03a120pp|75689253[/page]
but I shall now place
them on [deletion]that part where[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]it[/unclear][/deletion] different parts of the
apparatus - they now
attract each other.; -
- And in a communication
destroys the two powers -
The [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] mutual attraction
of [underline]electrified bodies[/underline]; indicates
[underline]diversity of power[/underline]. Their repulsion
similarity or identity of
power.-
- These facts must be particularly
attended to they are our guides
in electrical researches.- They
afford the principles on which
our instruments for measuring
electrical effects are constructed.
-. If [deletion]to the Ele[/deletion] the Spheres
in this cylinder be made repulsive
to each other And Electrified
sealing wax be presented to them

[page]21||dnp03a121pp|75689254[/page]
42
they recede still farther; but
if Electrified Glass be used
they approach each other.-
-.. Electrified Glass or sealing
wax then are considered as
in opposite states.- And are
in[underline] opposite states[/underline.- And are
the substances generally used
for determining what is the
electrical state of any part
of a system of bodies-
- The Electricity of that kind
exhibited by [underline]Glass[/underline] was named by
M. du Fay; the first person
who pointed out the distinction
Vitreous electricity-. The Electricity
conceived to be opposite was
called by him resinous electricity
from its being exhibited under
common circumstances by [underline]Resinous[/underline]
bodies _ D[superscript]r[/superscript] Franklin adopted
the names [underline]negative[/underline] & [underline]positive[/underline]
founding the nomenclature on a most
[deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]ingenious[/insertion] hypothesis" that the excess of
xxxxx circumstances by Resinous

[page]22||dnp03a122pp|75689255[/page]
deficiency of one peculiar etherial
 fluid was the cause of
the phaenomena.- His nomenclature
I shall use in preference to
that of du Fay. It is much
more generally employed. It
is sanctioned by the usage
of those philosophers who [insertion]lately[/insertion] have
made the greatest additions
to the [underline]Science[/underline] - I_ But in
adopting the nomenclature,
it is not necessary to adopt
the speculative part of the
doctrine:-... Our knowledge
is not yet sufficiently
advanced to enable us
to decide concerning the
[underline]Cause[/underline] of Electricity - This
is a question [deletion][unclear]not un[/unclear][/deletion]analogous
to that of the causes of
gravitation-. The [deletion]phaenomena[/deletion] facts
may be considered independent
of this enquiry & the laws
investigated.- Whether one fluid
or many fluids, or merely

[page]23||dnp03a123pp|75689256[/page]
23[deletion]7[/deletion]
43
powers of attraction & repulsion produce
the phaenomena will probably be
long a matter of doubt. - I shall
not in the least enter upon
this discussion; - I shall
use the terms negative & positive
merely as signifying [deletion]a[/deletion] particular
[insertion]series[/insertion] of different effects as agencies
which are opposed to each
other. -
-(- I shall often have occasion
[underline]to refer[/underline] to the tests or
measures of Electricity. -
- These are the two most
sensible Instruments

of Bennet.
2. The Electrometer of
[underline]Coulomb[/underline].

[page]24||dnp03a124pp|75689257[/page]
You saw that in this system
when active there were two different
states which might be indicated
by the Electrometer. - A minute
examination of all the varieties
of electrical action will shew
that this is a [underline]general law[/underline],
that the two electricities always
coexist in different parts of
the same combination - & that
whenever a positive electricity - is found
[deletion]exists[/deletion], Negative is likewise [deletion]exists[/deletion][insertion]present[/insertion]
[underline]equal[/underline] in quantity or capable
of neutralizing or ballancing
it.

shewn; - If the two Metals

- I spoke of the Electricity of the Tourmaline
When this [underline]body[/underline] is [underline]heated[/underline].- It exhibits
at its two ends or poles the

The [deletion]sealing wax[/deletion] [insertion]Glass[/insertion] appeared to

to the positive one.; & let
it be broken in any
part & it would be found
to possess [underline]two poles[/underline].-
-: - The case would be analogous
with the [underline]Sealing wax[/underline] - ie for
the negative pole. There would be
a positive pole, at a little
distance, then a negative one again
- & so on till all effect ceases.
Even in the system of Cylinders
there are more electrical poles than are obvious
