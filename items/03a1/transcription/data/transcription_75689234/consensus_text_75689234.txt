In the Course of lectures which
I had the honour of delivering
to You this spring in develloping
the general doctrines of Chemistry
I [deletion]alluded[/deletion] often had occasion to refer
to their connection with Electricity
It is my present object to enter
explicitly upon this subject; &
to examine minutely the relations
between these two great departments
of natural knowledge, which
as I hope to be able to
demonstrate to You, though
they appear to be separate &
distinct are but as Scions
from the same stock when when
profoundly examined, [insertion][deletion]di[/deletion] are discovered to have a common[/insertion] [deletion]having the[/deletion]
[deletion]same[/deletion] origin & [insertion]to be[/insertion] governed by [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]same[/deletion] [insertion]analogous[/insertion] laws._
