You saw that in this system
when active there were two different
states which might be indicated
by the Electrometer. - A minute
examination of all the varieties
of electrical action will shew
that this is a [underline]general law[/underline],
that the two electricities always
coexist in different parts of
the same combination - & that
whenever a positive electricity - is found
[deletion]exists[/deletion], Negative is likewise [deletion]exists[/deletion][insertion]present[/insertion]
[underline]equal[/underline] in quantity or capable
of neutralizing or ballancing
it.
The Electrical effect of Zinc
in contact with copper, was
shewn; - If the two Metals
be examined as to their
states the Zinc will be found positive
[deletion]+[/deletion] the Copper negative.
& by connecting them by a metallic
wire the action would cease.
