- I spoke of the Electricity of the Tourmaline
When this [underline]body[/underline] is [underline]heated[/underline].- It exhibits
at its two ends or poles the
two Electricities - & all action
ceases when these ends are
connected by a piece of Tin
 [underline]foil[/underline]. -
The [deletion]sealing wax[/deletion] [insertion]Glass[/insertion] appeared to
be only [underline]positive;-[/underline] - But if carefully
examined - it would have exhibited
a [deletion]positive[/deletion] [underline]negative pole[/underline] exactly commensurate
to the positive one.; & let
it be broken in any
part & it would be found
to possess [underline]two poles[/underline].-
-: - The case would be analogous
with the [underline]Sealing wax[/underline] - ie for
the negative pole. There would be
a positive pole, at a little
distance, then a negative one again
- & so on till all effect ceases.
Even in the system of Cylinders
there are more electrical poles than are obvious
|_ This [underline]property[/underline] you will find exhibited[/underline]
