not yet studied the circumstances
of this kind of action
- This [deletion]conductor is[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]Body[/deletion] Cylinder is[/insertion]
[underline]Positive & negative[/underline] - If I
apply this it receives electrical
[underline]influence[/underline] - Instance -
[underline]remove it[/underline] [underline]has two poles[/underline]
It is a conductor
