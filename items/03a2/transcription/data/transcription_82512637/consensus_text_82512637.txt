According to these ideas it follows
that the chemical combination of
Oxygene & inflammable bases ought

decomposed [insertion]by artificial electricity,[/insertion] according to the
principles which were stated in
the last lecture.
And this we shall find to be the
case. If we bring any [underline]compound[/underline]
of [underline]oxygene[/underline] into a state in which
