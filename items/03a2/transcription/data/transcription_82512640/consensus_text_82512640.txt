as having stated that when an
acid is made positive, &
an alkali negative they refuse
to combine because they are
in [underline]opposite[/underline] electrical states.-
Whereas, I believe I did say
[deletion]&[/deletion]or I certainly meant to say
that when an acid which
is [underline]naturally negative[/underline] is made
[underline]positive[/underline] it refuses to combine
with an alkali which is
naturally positive [deletion]both being[/deletion]
in consequence of their
being in the same state
& vice versa. -

I am obliged to the Gentleman
who [deletion]has undertaken[/deletion] [insertion]had the kindness[/insertion] to vindicate
the electrochemical theory, from
what He has conceived to be
my own attacks upon it. Nor (even
supposing a misrepresentation)
shall I feel any uneasiness
