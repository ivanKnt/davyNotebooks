[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
Amongst the great classes of
Natural objects none are
more calculated to arrest
the attention of the inquisitive
mind than those belonging
to the atmosphere.
- The air is the medium
by which light & heat are
transmitted to us from the
sun. It is the seat of clouds
the birthplace of winds & the
source of rain & dew of
rivers & springs. [deletion]Vegetable[/deletion]

& animals are supported

with its circulation. -
- In every philosophical system
therefore even from the earliest
ages [underline]enquiries[/underline] or [underline]speculations[/underline]
concerning the Atmosphere
have occupied a distinguished
place.
In the Greek & Roman
Schools of Physical Science. Air
was at some times supposed
to be an element & at
others a modification of water. -
- The ideas of the alchemists
were not materially different
Till the discovery of the
airpump no exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] made upon the subject
which was wholly incapable
of being elucidated by
mere observations upon common

[deletion]The improvement of the[/deletion]
[deletion]air pump by [person]person_103|Boyle[/person] led[/deletion]
[deletion]to great discoveries of the[/deletion] of the
[deletion]weight elasticity & other[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]mechanical properties[/underline] of[/deletion]
[deletion]air.[/deletion] The enquiries concerning
its mechanical properties
led to exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on its chemical
nature & the great era
of improvement in Chemistry
of the foundation of that
School which has been called
the pneumatic School may
be dated from the period
of the discovery of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] gas.
- Before I speak more
fully on this subject, I shall

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00004|dnp03a204pp|82512628[/page]
endeavour practically to demonstrate
to you the processes by
which [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] gas may be
obtained- & By [deletion]being[/deletion] becoming
acquainted with the
substance you will probably
take a greater interest in

by [chemical]chemical_300|Minium[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical]
was discovered by [person]person_016|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley[/person].
Other experimenters have claimed
this merit; but the priority
rests with the english Enquirer
& Scheele is the only chemist
who seems to have produced
the same result by another
method & without any Knowledge
of what [person]person_016|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley[/person] was
doing.--
Mr [person]person_030|Lavoisier[/person] in his [otherwork]otherwork_049|elements[/otherwork]
of Chemistry has said "this

that upon this occasion
So great a man should
have rendered himself liable to
[deletion]appear deficient in candour[/deletion]

not of candour.
[person]person_016|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley[/person] in one of his

the distinct statement of
the case. "He says "

According to these ideas it follows
that the chemical combination of
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & inflammable bases ought
under certain circumstances to be
[underline]destroyed[/underline], & compounds of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
decomposed [insertion]by artificial electricity,[/insertion] according to the
principles which were stated in
the last lecture.
And this we shall find to be the
case. If we bring any [underline]compound[/underline]
of [chemical]chemical_022|[underline]Oxygene[/underline][/chemical] into a state in which
the natural electrical energies
of its elements are [underline]altered[/underline] or
[underline]destroyed[/underline]: by [deletion]or artificially[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] Electricity;
the new arrangements will be
precisely such as might have
been expected [deletion]from the application[/deletion]
[deletion]the hypothesis[/deletion] considering the hypothesis
as strictly correct.
- Thus [deletion][chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical][/deletion] [insertion]Sulphuric[/insertion] acid consists of
[chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] which are

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00014|dnp03a214pp|82512638[/page]
respectively positive & negative &
which exist in consequence
in combination.-

Now let us conceive [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical]

[underline]Instance[/underline].
- . I [deletion]give[/deletion] have been more minute
upon this subject [deletion]than is[/deletion]
[deletion]perhaps[/deletion] because I find that
in the transient view that
I took of the electro-chemical
Hypothesis [insertion]when I last had the honour of addressing you[/insertion], I was [insertion]entirely[/insertion] misunderstood
[deletion]at least[/deletion] by one of my auditors
[deletion]which I can scarcely attribute[/deletion]
[deletion]to any other cause than[/deletion]
who from the view that He
has taken, seems to possess
no common share of acuteness
[deletion]& whose[/deletion]
& whose instance induces me
to suppose that I failed in [deletion]instead of[/deletion] accomplishing
my ardent wish of
being intelligible & familiar
[deletion]I must have failed altogether[/deletion]
I [deletion]must have been obscure[/deletion]
[deletion]& composed & involved my subject[/deletion]
[deletion]in confusion & obscurity.[/deletion]
- In the [otherwork]otherwork_162|philosophical Magazine[/otherwork]
for the last month, I am considered

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00016|dnp03a216pp|82512640[/page]
as having stated that when an
acid is made positive, &
an alkali negative they refuse
to combine because they are
in [underline]opposite[/underline] electrical states.-
Whereas, I believe I did say
[deletion]&[/deletion]or I certainly meant to say
that when an acid which
is [underline]naturally negative[/underline] is made
[underline]positive[/underline] it refuses to combine
with an alkali which is
naturally positive [deletion]both being[/deletion]
in consequence of their
being in the same state
& vice versa. -
- . I must however [deletion]state[/deletion][insertion]say[/insertion] that
I am obliged to the Gentleman
who [deletion]has undertaken[/deletion] [insertion]had the kindness[/insertion] to vindicate
the electrochemical theory, from
what He has conceived to be
my own attacks upon it. Nor (even
supposing a misrepresentation)
shall I feel any uneasiness

[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion], [insertion]Philosophical[/insertion], discussion when
conducted by [deletion]true[/deletion] the spirit
of true liberality can only
produce [insertion]good effects[/insertion]. It ought to stimulate
to [deletion]experimental[/deletion] [insertion]actual[/insertion] research. And it
would be to me a source of
high gratification if any
thing said or done in these
lectures, led [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]any one[/deletion][/insertion] new exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
and new discoveries. The labourers
in natural Philosophy (it
has often struck me) ought to
resemble those first adventurers
who ascended [underline]Mount Blanc[/underline],
they owed their success to combined
efforts. A single individual must
have failed or perished in the
attempt, assisted by a common
tie, acting always in concert,
[deletion]they[/deletion] & marched on [insertion]encouraging each other[/insertion] regardless of
[deletion]obstacles[/deletion] difficulty till they
had attained the [underline]summit[/underline]

more complicated-

- The same principles may be applied
[insertion]with some variation[/insertion] to other [underline]detonating[/underline] compounds.
- And there is a great subject
for exp[superscript]t[/superscript] & discussion open
in " these [underline]latent[/underline] [deletion]electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]energies[/deletion] (as they may be named)
electrical energies which are
capable of being brought into
activity with such wonderful
effects.-
There is no reason to suppose
that we have attained
the perfection of this kind
of [underline]force[/underline] in [underline]gunpowder[/underline]; on

the contrary our principles &
even some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] seem to
shew " that [deletion][unclear]smaller[/unclear][/deletion] combinations
as easily managed may be
produced of a much more
powerful kind. -
[deletion]Should such objects be attain[/deletion]
In stating this circumstance
I cannot however pass over
the subject without mentioning
that should even such
objects be attained & applied
[deletion]even[/deletion] to the purposes of
war, there is no motive for
believing that the friends
of humanity would have reason
to regret the result.-
Even the [deletion]earliest[/deletion] [insertion]only[/insertion] invention
of this kind as would appear
from all historical records, has
tended to render contests, less
personal & bloody to exalt
talents & ingenuity [deletion]upon[/deletion] above mere

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00022|dnp03a222pp|82512646[/page]
brutal strength -. One of
the reasons probably [deletion]o[/deletion] for
the constant peace of
[place]place_019|[underline]China[/underline][/place] was their early
Knowledge of Gunpowder
& [underline]the fear of[/underline] this terrible
agent, which the more
[underline]enterprising Europeans[/underline] have
So [deletion]successfully em[/deletion] powerfully applied.
Were a combination infinitely
more powerful discovered,
no one would enter the
field with the certainty
of being destroyed, & mutual
& inevitable danger must
lead to confidence. -
