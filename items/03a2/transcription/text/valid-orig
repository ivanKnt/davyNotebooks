Oxygene
Amongst the great classes of
Natural objects none are
more calculated to arrest
the attention of the inquisitive
mind than those belonging
to the atmosphere.
- The air is the medium
by which light & heat are
transmitted to us from the
sun. It is the seat of clouds
the birthplace of winds & the
source of rain & dew of
rivers & springs. [deletion]Vegetable[/deletion]

with its circulation. -
- In every philosophical system
therefore even from the earliest
ages [underline]enquiries[/underline] or [underline]speculations[/underline]
concerning the Atmosphere
have occupied a distinguished
place.
In the Greek & Roman
Schools of Physical Science. Air
was at some times supposed
to be an element & at
others a modification of water. -
- The ideas of the alchemists
were not materially different
Till the discovery of the
airpump no exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] made upon the subject
which was wholly incapable
of being elucidated by
mere observations upon common

[deletion]The improvement of the[/deletion]

[deletion]to great discoveries of the[/deletion] of the

[deletion][underline]mechanical properties[/underline] of[/deletion]
[deletion]air.[/deletion] The enquiries concerning
its mechanical properties
led to exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on its chemical
nature & the great era
of improvement in Chemistry
of the foundation of that
School which has been called
the pneumatic School may
be dated from the period
of the discovery of Oxygene gas.
- Before I speak more
fully on this subject, I shall

endeavour practically to demonstrate
to you the processes by
which Oxygene gas may be
obtained- & By [deletion]being[/deletion] becoming
acquainted with the

take a greater interest in
its[underline]nature[/underline], [underline]qualities[/underline] &

The first process for
procuring Oxygene gas [deletion]by[/deletion] that
by Minium & sulphuric acid
was discovered by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley.
Other experimenters have claimed
this merit; but the priority
rests with the english Enquirer
& Scheele is the only chemist
who seems to have produced
the same result by another
method & without any Knowledge
of what D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley was
doing.--
Mr Lavoisier in his [otherwork]otherwork_049|elements[/otherwork]
of Chemistry has said "this
species of air meaning oxygene gas

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00006|dnp03a206pp|82512630[/page]
was discovered nearly at
the same time by D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Priestley, M[superscript]r[/superscript] Scheele &
myself."-. One regrets
that upon this occasion
So great a man should
have rendered himself liable to
[deletion]appear deficient in candour[/deletion]
the imputation of a defect of memory if
[deletion]or at least in memory[/deletion]"
not of candour.
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley in one of his
latest works gives in his
usual unaffected manner
the distinct statement of
the case. "He says "
I have been induced
to read this passage because
in many foreign books that
have been translated, & in more

the claim of Lavoisier as
a Discoverer of Oxygene gas has

According to these ideas it follows
that the chemical combination of
Oxygene & inflammable bases ought
under certain circumstances to be
[underline]destroyed[/underline], & compounds of oxygene
decomposed [insertion]by artificial electricity,[/insertion] according to the
principles which were stated in
the last lecture.
And this we shall find to be the
case. If we bring any [underline]compound[/underline]
of [underline]oxygene[/underline] into a state in which
the natural electrical energies
of its elements are [underline]altered[/underline] or
[underline]destroyed[/underline]: by [deletion]or artificially[/deletion] Voltaic Electricity;
the new arrangements will be
precisely such as might have
been expected [deletion]from the application[/deletion]
[deletion]the hypothesis[/deletion] considering the hypothesis
as strictly correct.
- Thus [deletion]Sulphuric acid[/deletion] [insertion]Sulphuric[/insertion] acid consists of
Sulphur & oxygene which are

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00014|dnp03a214pp|82512638[/page]
respectively positive & negative &
which exist in consequence
in combination.-

- . I [deletion]give[/deletion] have been more minute
upon this subject [deletion]than is[/deletion]
[deletion]perhaps[/deletion] because I find that
in the transient view that
I took of the electro-chemical
Hypothesis [insertion]when I last had the honour of addressing you[/insertion], I was [insertion]entirely[/insertion] misunderstood
[deletion]at least[/deletion] by one of my auditors
[deletion]which I can scarcely attribute[/deletion]
[deletion]to any other cause than[/deletion]
who from the view that He
has taken, seems to possess
no common share of acuteness
[deletion]& whose[/deletion]
& whose instance induces me
to suppose that I failed in [deletion]instead of[/deletion] accomplishing
my ardent wish of
being intelligible & familiar
[deletion]I must have failed altogether[/deletion]
I [deletion]must have been obscure[/deletion]
[deletion]& composed & involved my subject[/deletion]
[deletion]in confusion & obscurity.[/deletion]
- In the philosophical Magazine
for the last month, I am considered

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00016|dnp03a216pp|82512640[/page]
as having stated that when an
acid is made positive, &
an alkali negative they refuse
to combine because they are
in [underline]opposite[/underline] electrical states.-
Whereas, I believe I did say
[deletion]&[/deletion]or I certainly meant to say
that when an acid which
is [underline]naturally negative[/underline] is made
[underline]positive[/underline] it refuses to combine
with an alkali which is
naturally positive [deletion]both being[/deletion]
in consequence of their
being in the same state
& vice versa. -
- . I must however [deletion]state[/deletion][insertion]say[/insertion] that
I am obliged to the Gentleman
who [deletion]has undertaken[/deletion] [insertion]had the kindness[/insertion] to vindicate
the electrochemical theory, from
what He has conceived to be
my own attacks upon it. Nor (even
supposing a misrepresentation)
shall I feel any uneasiness

Lavoisiers theory will not apply

[deletion]of[/deletion] the results afforded by

more complicated-

- The same principles may be applied
[insertion]with some variation[/insertion] to other [underline]detonating[/underline] compounds.
- And there is a great subject
for exp[superscript]t[/superscript] & discussion open
in " these [underline]latent[/underline] [deletion]electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]energies[/deletion] (as they may be named)
electrical energies which are
capable of being brought into
activity with such wonderful
effects.-
There is no reason to suppose
that we have attained
the perfection of this kind
of [underline]force[/underline] in [underline]gunpowder[/underline]; on

the contrary our principles &
even some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] seem to
shew " that [deletion][unclear]smaller[/unclear][/deletion] combinations
as easily managed may be
produced of a much more
powerful kind. -
[deletion]Should such objects be attain[/deletion] 
In stating this circumstance
I cannot however pass over
the subject without mentioning
that should even such
objects be attained & applied
[deletion]even[/deletion] to the purposes of
war, there is no motive for
believing that the friends
of humanity would have reason
to regret the result.-
Even the [deletion]earliest[/deletion] [insertion]only[/insertion] invention
of this kind as would appear
from all historical records, has
tended to render contests, less
personal & bloody to exalt
talents & ingenuity [deletion]upon[/deletion] above mere

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10302-000-00022|dnp03a222pp|82512646[/page]
brutal strength -. One of
the reasons probably [deletion]o[/deletion] for
the constant peace of
[underline]China[/underline] was their early
Knowledge of Gunpowder
& [underline]the fear of[/underline] this terrible
agent, which the more
[underline]enterprising Europeans[/underline] have
So [deletion]successfully em[/deletion] powerfully applied.
Were a combination infinitely
more powerful discovered,
no one would enter the
field with the certainty
of being destroyed, & mutual
& inevitable danger must
lead to confidence. -
