Lecture 4. El.Chem
[underline]1809[/underline]
- The Electrical phenomena that
you have witnessed & that I endeavoured
to elucidate in the preceding Lectures
are of limited application. The
subjects which are now to occupy our
attention though they offer appearances
perhaps less brilliant & less impressive
are yet of much more considerable
extent & of much [underline]greater[/underline] importance.-
|_The physical effects of Electricity
those associated with heat & light or
[underline]fire,[/underline] though [underline]splendid[/underline] & [underline]magnificent[/underline]
are yet for the most part of rare
occurrence; The chemical results
on the contrary as I shall endeavour
to prove are uniformly taking place
& connected with the constant order
of operations both in Nature & Art.-
