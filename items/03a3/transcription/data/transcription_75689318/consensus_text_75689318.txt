decompositions of rocks those degradations
of firm solid surfaces; those changes
in soils, those productions of alkaline
& acid matter, for which we have

a red clay -
Now I found by a careful analysis
that this rock in it's state of
aggregation contains alkaline matter
But in it's state of decomposition
