found negative of course the
electricity of the surface would
be of the same kind - Now
if we conceive that in instances
where atmospherical electricity is
manifested, the surface of this rock
becomes negative, the effect would
be the attraction of the alkali
from an integrant part of it to
this surface which alkali would
be gradually washed away by the
action of rain - And clay would
result, as we find it always
to result free from alkali from
it's decomposition-
- We might generalize upon this
instance, - there are few rocks
that do not contain alkaline, or
