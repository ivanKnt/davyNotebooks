- Water has only a very
slow action upon Zinc
& covers it with a nonconducting
[underline]coat of oxide[/underline], Acids on
the contrary dissolve Zinc.
- & this solution we shall
find is connected with
the [underline]continued[/underline] [deletion]a[/deletion] & powerful
action of the battery.
- According to the
Theory.
[superscript]-[/superscript] Zinc is positive
- .
- [underline]Copper[/underline] Negative
Nitrous acid is negative
both with respect to
Zinc & copper.
-. The acid occasions a continued
solution of the Zinc, consequenty
a new surface is continually
exposed & [underline]this surface[/underline] is
[underline]positive[/underline]. - So that the
continued action of the battery
is a continued destruction of one
