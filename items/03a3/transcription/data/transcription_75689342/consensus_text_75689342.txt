- [deletion]In fact[/deletion] [insertion]Indeed[/insertion] the only use
of an Hypothesis is that
it should lead to experiments
that it should be a
guide to facts:- In

are always of use - The

hardly ever takes place
without the discovery

Upon all occasions when
I [underline]venture upon a conjecture[/underline],
You will I trust have
the goodness to consider it
as brought forwards in
the same spirit -. Not
as an [underline]opinion[/underline] which it
would be [underline]painful[/underline], to relinquish,
but as a hint [deletion]leading[/deletion] which may
lead to enquiry.
