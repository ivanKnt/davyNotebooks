Lecture 4. El.Chem
[underline]1809[/underline]
- The Electrical phenomena that
you have witnessed & that I endeavoured
to elucidate in the preceding Lectures
are of limited application. The
subjects which are now to occupy our
attention though they offer appearances
perhaps less brilliant & less impressive
are yet of much more considerable
extent & of much [underline]greater[/underline] importance.-
|_The physical effects of Electricity
those associated with heat & light or
[underline]fire,[/underline] though [underline]splendid[/underline] & [underline]magnificent[/underline]
are yet for the most part of rare
occurrence; The chemical results
on the contrary as I shall endeavour
to prove are uniformly taking place
& connected with the constant order
of operations both in Nature & Art.-

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00002|dnp03a301pp|75689289[/page]
I shall not be expected to
enter into a definition of what is
meant by chemical results - -
They take place whenever the nature
of bodies is changed, & the
common appearances in [insertion]y[superscript]e[/superscript][/insertion] external World
[deletion]Nature[/deletion] are to a great extent
dependent upon them.-
- When clouds form in the Atmosphere
- When their contents fall in rain, are
absorbed by the earth & become
the nourishment of Plants - the
effect is chemical. - When the
coal in our fire is consumed
& converted into an elastic vapour-
- When in artificial processes, Glass
or porcelain is formed, or metals
reduced from their ores, or dying
materials fixed on stuffs, or pigments

formed for the Artist - All these
operations so intimately connected
with improvement & civilization
are chemical. -
- The contemplation of such facts,
whether exhibiting the wonderful order
of the System of Nature or presenting
proofs of the exercise of human
talents, is a delightful subject of
contemplation. - And the study of
their causes or the laws by which
they are governed is a noble exercise
for the Understanding. -
- From what do they result?-
on what hidden properties of things
do they depend? These are questions
which even a moderate degree only
of curiosity must lead to; And they

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00004|dnp03a303pp|75689291[/page]
are questions the solution of which
will carry us to the discussion
of the intimate relations existing
between Chemistry & Electricity
& to the developement of those
principles on which I have
ventured to found the arrangements
of Electrochemical Science. -
- - In all Elementary treatises
upon Chemistry - the changes in
the forms of substances are justly
referred to an [underline]attractive[/underline] force
acting upon the particles of
[underline]matter[/underline], which is called Chemical
 Affinity or [underline]Chemical Attraction[/underline];-
& the harmonious cycle of events
belonging to the [deletion]Chemistry of the[/deletion]
System of the Earth is referred

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00005|dnp03a304pp|75689292[/page]
to this power; in the same manner
as the equally harmonious & more
distinct order of revolutions of the
heavenly bodies, is referred to Gravitation
- - Experiments of Chemical Affinity
may be made to any extent. - Almost
the whole of operative Chemistry is a
series of exhibitions of them. I shall
ask for your attention to a very few
only.

- Different bodies attract each other with
very different degrees of force.- And
on this principle [insertion]chemical[/insertion] processes of decomposition
have [insertion]been hitherto[/insertion] chiefly founded.-

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00006|dnp03a305pp|75689293[/page]
Nitrous acid we have seen attracts
[chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] - but it attracts [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical]
more strongly & forms a soluble
compound with it. -
Instance. -
[chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical]
By most of my audience these
instances I know have been often
witnessed - but as there are some
present to whom the illustration
of Chemical Attraction may be new
it is necessary to give the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript].
[deletion]though the form is[/deletion] [insertion]the form[/insertion] [insertion]however[/insertion] simple & obvious.-
- The unknown [deletion]& the obscure[/deletion] must be
gradually elucidated by the known
& the distinct.-- And it is my ardent
wish that not a single link in the
chain of Evidence should be lost to
a single individual. -

- I see with a mixed sensation of pleasure
& uneasiness seated on those benches
Proficients [insertion]Masters[/insertion] in Science much more capable
of instructing me than I am of enlightening
them.- Proficients [insertion]Masters[/insertion], to whom the elementary
truths can be but as the Characters of
a language with which they are
perfectly acquainted.- But I conceive
that it is the duty of a lecturer to
address himself to the uninitiated -
That it should be his pride to render
himself intelligible to such. - & I
am convinced that those who are
[underline]most[/underline] instructed will [insertion]be[/insertion] [underline]least[/underline] fastidious
in a matter of this kind - & that
[deletion]such as[/deletion] [insertion]that in[/insertion] appreciating the difficulties
of adapting a series of disquisitions
to the taste of an audience composed
of members so different - of [underline]persons[/underline]

distinguished for [insertion]literary[/insertion] attainments,
those merely in search of liberal
amusement.- Students, &
[insertion]adepts[/insertion] in Science;- Such as
estimate these difficulties will I
trust be indured to treat a failure
in exciting general interest, rather
with a [insertion][deletion]look[/deletion] smile[/insertion] of encouragement
& indulgence than with a [deletion]look [insertion]smile[/insertion][/deletion]
[insertion][deletion]look[/deletion][/insertion] [insertion]frown[/insertion] of indifference or [deletion]a smile[/deletion] of contempt. -

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00009|dnp03a308pp|75689296[/page]
-
An immense number of Substances
exert on each [underline]other chemical[/underline]
[underline]attractions[/underline]- . - There are no
known bodies that do not possess
[deletion]exert[/deletion] this power with respect
to some other body.-
-|_ The [underline]instances[/underline] adduced in the
preceding lectures shew [deletion]likewise[/deletion]
that electrical attraction is
as general a property:-
- And I have said that
there is an analogy or
coincidence between them which
it is not difficult to trace
& to illustrate..
[deletion]- Now let us pursue this subject.[/deletion]
- - [deletion]The [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] rubber of[/deletion]
[deletion]the machine adheres to the[/deletion]
[deletion]glass, they attract each[/deletion]
[deletion]other & we say that they[/deletion]

[deletion]are in opposite electrical states[/deletion]
[deletion]the glass positive, the [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] negative -[/deletion]
[deletion]-. & it was stated as a general[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]proposition[/underline][/deletion]-.
[deletion]- [underline]Electrical attractions[/underline] are[/deletion]
[deletion]exhibited by the surfaces of[/deletion]
[deletion]Bodies retaining their[/deletion]
[deletion]coherence as masses &[/deletion]
[deletion]are capable of being[/deletion]
[deletion]communicated to other[/deletion]
[deletion]bodies - This [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] & glass[/deletion]
[deletion]- For instance [deletion][chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical][/deletion][/deletion]
[deletion]placed [underline]in contact[/underline] attract each[/deletion]
[deletion]other; & if the [chemical]chemical_201|[deletion]zinc[/deletion][/chemical] [insertion][misc]misc_810|silk[/misc][/insertion] be[/deletion]
[deletion]made to touch one piece[/deletion]
[deletion]of Gold leaf & the [chemical]chemical_070|[deletion]copper[/deletion][/chemical] glass[/deletion]
[deletion]another; these will likewise[/deletion]
[deletion]attract each other -[/deletion]
[deletion]We say that the glass[/deletion]
[deletion]is [underline]positive[/underline], the [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] is [underline]negative[/underline].[/deletion]
[deletion]Again [deletion][chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical][/deletion][chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] if[/deletion]

[deletion]brought in contact exhibit electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]effects ie [deletion]th[/deletion] have the power[/deletion]
[deletion]of communicating their attractive[/deletion]
[deletion]energies to other bodies _[/deletion]
[deletion]- They likewise are said to[/deletion]
[deletion]be respectively [underline]positive[/underline] & [underline]negative[/underline][/deletion]
[deletion]- Their [underline]attraction[/underline] [insertion][underline]as masses[/underline][/insertion] & the communication[/deletion]
[deletion]of [underline]their power of attraction[/underline];[/deletion]
[deletion]are [underline]the [deletion]only[/deletion] facts[/underline], - & in the[/deletion]
[deletion]common [deletion]electrical[/deletion] language of [misc]misc_235|Electricians[/misc][/deletion]
[deletion]Bodies which act in this manner[/deletion]
[deletion]are said to be positive &[/deletion]
[deletion]negative-.[/deletion]
-:-. The first fact of Electrical
attraction is that it makes Bodies
cohere [insertion]or attract each other as[/insertion] Masses
[underline]for instance[/underline]. [underline]glass & [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc][/underline]
[chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]. -
But chemical attraction
must be conceived to act
upon [deletion]Bodies[/deletion] particles, upon the

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00012|dnp03a311pp|75689299[/page]
intimate [deletion]of[/deletion] atoms or elements
of bodies.- |_If [deletion]we[/deletion] the inference
be made that they are
dependant upon the same cause
it can only be from [underline]facts[/underline]
which shew that they are
[deletion]always[/deletion] associated together,
& that they are generated
modified or destroyed under
the same circumstances.-
|_The first enquiry to be
made is whether those
bodies which exert electrical
attractions [deletion]as masses[/deletion] when
[underline]coherent as masses[/underline], are
such as chemically combine
when their particles possess
freedom of motion. -
- let us examine the
first instances that present
themselves. [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] & Zinc-
[chemical]chemical_321|Brass[/chemical]
- Gold & [chemical]chemical_033|quicksilver[/chemical]

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00013|dnp03a312pp|75689300[/page]
- [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & silver-
- [deletion]Now let us take [insertion]&[/insertion][/deletion] [insertion]again as a [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] converse instances
[deletion]of Bodies that chemically[/deletion]
combine-
[underline][chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_315|oxalic acid[/chemical][/underline]
[underline]These are highly electrical[/underline].
-. [deletion][chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] &[/deletion] [deletion]L[/deletion] [deletion][chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical][/deletion]
|_ But are their electrical
energies or [deletion]attr[/deletion] attractions
of bodies & [underline]the chemical[/underline]
affinities [underline]coincident[/underline] [underline]in force[/underline]?
- This will be found
 to be the case - [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
combines with [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] much
more readily than with iron -
- Its electrical energy is
likewise much greater with

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00014|dnp03a313pp|75689301[/page]
[chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] than with iron -
[chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] unites to silver
or [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] or iron; but
does not [insertion][deletion]as[/deletion] readily[/insertion] combine with [deletion][chemical]chemical_187|Bismuth[/chemical][/deletion]Gold
[deletion]gold[/deletion] & its electrical
energies are by far
the greatest with respect
to these metals for
which it has the
highest affinity.
/_It would be easy to multiply
instances of [underline]this kind[/underline] from
the [underline]great general[/underline] series of
[underline]chemical facts[/underline]; /_but some
apparent objections must
not be overlooked. -
[misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] & Glass for instance
display a very strong electrical
energy with respect to each
other; but there is no
chemical combination of them
known. /_How is this to be

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00015|dnp03a314pp|75689302[/page]
80
[deletion]be[/deletion] reconciled to the principle?
-.. - |_ It must be always kept
[underline]in mind[/underline] that for chemical
union there must be freedom
of motion [underline]between the parts[/underline].- -
Solids will not unite to
each other chemically -
two fluids unite readily,
- & [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] bodies
in general still more
readily -
-. Now [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] is a body
decomposible by heat - It
cannot as you will know
be rendered [underline]fluid by heat[/underline]-
- It [insertion]it is not capable of[/insertion] [deletion]cannot therefore[/deletion] being put
in a condition to act
chemically upon glass; - This
therefore is no objection against
the series of facts.-
- [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & glass are highly

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00016|dnp03a315pp|75689303[/page]
electrical with respect to each
other; but they do not
combine for a similar
[underline]reason[/underline] That is to say
if the [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & glass be
heated together, the [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical]
rises in vapour [deletion]long before[/deletion]
at a temperature much lower
than that which softens
the glass -. Yet the
constituents parts of the
glass are known to
have strong chemical attractions
for [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] - Glass as
I shall shew hereafter
is a compound metallic
oxides & [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of[/deletion] much of[/insertion] its elementary
[insertion]matter[/insertion] when [deletion]these[/deletion] possess freedom
of motion that is when
they are in solution

[underline][nonenglish]nonenglish_009|quere[/nonenglish] Instance[/underline]

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00017|dnp03a316pp|75689304[/page]
- [deletion]The[/deletion] |_That [deletion]the two[/deletion] chemical
& electrical attraction belong
to the same [underline]bodies[/underline] is
in favour of the idea
of [deletion]their being[/deletion] [insertion]that they are[/insertion] the same
[underline]power exerted[/underline] under [underline]different[/underline]
[underline]circumstances[/underline];- but much
[underline]stronger analogies[/underline] are wanting
to give to this opinion
the [underline]character[/underline], even of a
[underline]probable Theory[/underline]. -
-  - As [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]power of[/insertion] Electrical
attraction is capable not
only of being communicated
from [deletion]one body[/deletion] system of bodies
to others but likewise of
being [underline]accumulated[/underline], it would
be reasonable to expect

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00018|dnp03a317pp|75689305[/page]
according to the hypothesis
that " [underline]Chemical attraction[/underline],
might be modified
[underline]destroyed[/underline] or created
by the application
of such [underline]accumulated[/underline]
[underline]power[/underline].
:For instance [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
& [deletion][chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical][/deletion] [insertion][chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical][/insertion] are
conceived to attract each
other in consequence
of a power which in
the acid is corespondent-.
[deletion]to a negat[/deletion]
- to that force which
[underline]renders[/underline] bodies negatively
electrical. & in the
alkali to that which
[underline]renders[/underline] bodies positively
electrical, & if [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical]
be introduced into a solution
of Nitrate of [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical].

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00019|dnp03a318pp|75689306[/page]
82
- The [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] is conceived to
throw down the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] in
consequence of its possessing
[underline]a higher[/underline] [deletion]po[/deletion] [underline]attractive power[/underline],
[deletion]of[/deletion] [underline]which[/underline] would corespondend
to its power of producing
a stronger electrical effect.
-:- But by means of
an [underline]electrical[/underline] Battery.
A metallic surface can
be [underline]made [deletion]positive[/deletion][/underline] to exert the
[deletion]positive[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]neg[/deletion] positive[/insertion] energy in a very
[underline]high degree.[/underline] -. & in the
theory if this energy be
higher than the energ
of [underline]the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical][/underline], the acid
ought to quit [underline]the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical][/underline]

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00020|dnp03a319pp|75689307[/page]
& unite [insertion]to or attach itself to[/insertion] to the metallic
surface-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- In the like manner
as [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] would
[underline]displace[/underline] the [chemical]chemical_143|[underline]Nitric acid[/underline][/chemical],
so does a strongly electrified
Metallic surface attach
the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] - & the [chemical]chemical_010|[underline]lime[/underline][/chemical]
& [underline]the acid[/underline] attracted by
the metal if [deletion]we [unclear]part[/unclear][/deletion]
the parts of the Metal
be not capable of
[deletion][underline]combining[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]solution & no combination[/insertion] [deletion]with them[/deletion]
will rest in contact
or collect round [underline]the[/underline]
two opposite surfaces.
[underline]other earths & alkalies[/underline]
- Again Metals like
[chemical]chemical_010|[deletion]Lime[/deletion][/chemical] Earths & alkalies are
[deletion]positive with respect to acids-[/deletion]
conceived to exert an attraction
which belongs to the positive
energy when they act on acids

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00021|dnp03a320pp|75689308[/page]
- The attraction of acids is of
the same kind as that
belonging to negative electricity
- This is shewn by touching
any dry acid by a metallic
plate - "the Metal is found
positively electrified the acid
negatively -
- .A Metal therefore made strongly
negative ought no longer
to be capable of acting
upon [deletion]acid[/deletion] an acid -
& this is actually
the case.
[chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical]
- But if a metal be
positively electrified -" Have this
energy of attraction exalted
it will dissolve more rapidly -
- . And some metals that have
not [underline]naturally[/underline] sufficient attractive
power to dissolve in acids, become

Now this will actually occur. We

- The distance through which bodies
are capable of being repelled from
the different surfaces possessing
their own electricity, ie, electricity
of the same kind is very considerable
& the effect seems to be instantaneous.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[underline]Glass of [deletion]alkaline[/deletion] solution[/underline]
- And it is not merely through
water which has but a weak
affinity for [insertion]the acting substance[/insertion] [deletion]it[/deletion] that this transference

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00027|dnp03a326pp|75689314[/page]

can be performed, but it likewise
takes place when bodies possessing
the strongest chemical affinities
for the acting [deletion]surfaces[/deletion] substances
are made intermediate -|_Thus
an acid may be repelled & driven
through an alkaline solution from
the Negative to the positive surface
& an alkali may be passed in
like manner through an acid
solution to the negative surface- -
Instance 1[superscript]st[/superscript]
Instance 2[superscript]d[/superscript]
No effect from impurities nor
glass.
Here all the particles of the
acid must exert their attraction,
but the electrical power is stronger

the [deletion]en[/deletion] new energy is perfectly indifferent
as to it's ancient habitudes -
- In short chemical attractions
the attractions [insertion]which may be conceived[/insertion] dependent upon
the natural electrical energies
of matter disappear before the powers
of the artificial instrument; & in
consequence all the various laws
of combination & decomposition
are rendered capable of being
submitted to a strict investigation-
|_Hitherto all the instances of
decomposition have been of bodies
soluble in water, but solubility
is not essential for bodies

extending still farther the empire
of this grand power of decomposition-
Instance, [chemical]chemical_163|Gysum[/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_322|Fluor spar[/chemical] -
Glass
Even hard Rocks such as different
species of [chemical]chemical_105|Basaltes[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_125|Porphyries[/chemical]
& Granites [deletion]give all[/deletion] [insertion]all afford[/insertion] the small
quantity of alkaline matter they
contain, under this powerful
agency Not the most solid form
not the firmest integration is
capable of resisting this species of
attack. It proceeds slowly & in
moments imperceptibly, but it's
results are certain.
|_By the electrical changes
which are constantly taking place

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00030|dnp03a329pp|75689317[/page]
on the exterior of the earth; both by
the immediate contact of bodies
possessed of energies in a high
degree opposed & by induction from
the atmosphere; these phenomena
of chemical operations must be
continually produced-
- Whenever a surface is negative
the tendency of it must be to
occasion an accumulation of
earthy alkaline & metallic [deletion]matter[/deletion] [insertion]substances[/insertion]
in it's vicinity wherever there is
a freedom of motion in the
surrounding arrangements of
[deletion]substances[/deletion] [insertion]matter[/insertion]- When a surface is
positive, an [underline]opposite[/underline], but no
no less [underline]important[/underline] order of changes
must occur - |_& many of those

decompositions of rocks those degradations
of firm solid surfaces; those changes
in soils, those productions of alkaline
& acid matter, for which we have
hitherto been unable to find
any distinct specific causes,
may be safely [underline]referred[/underline] to the
great, widely diffused, & continually
operating powers of electrical
decomposition-
[underline]Instance[/underline] -
Now this rock is a [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]
& contains [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical]
& by decomposition it affords
a red clay -
Now I found by a careful analysis
that this rock in it's state of
aggregation contains alkaline matter
But in it's state of decomposition

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00032|dnp03a331pp|75689319[/page]
as clay it contains no alkaline
matter-
And if a piece of it when solid
be exposed moistened, with water
to the agency of negative Electricity
no alkali is develloped & the
rock becomes soft at it[deletion]'[/deletion]s surface
& a part of it is converted into
clay -
Instance-
- Now from the condensation of
vapour, the atmosphere is generally
positive & the surface of the earth
in consequence is by induction
negative - This appears to be
the case by a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
made by [person]person_480|Beccaria[/person], [person]person_086|Canton[/person] &
Cavallo- Metallic rods elevated
into the atmosphere are generally

[page]33|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00033|dnp03a332pp|75689320[/page]
found negative of course the
electricity of the surface would
be of the same kind - Now
if we conceive that in instances
where atmospherical electricity is
manifested, the surface of this rock
becomes negative, the effect would
be the attraction of the alkali
from an integrant part of it to
this surface which alkali would
be gradually washed away by the
action of rain - And clay would
result, as we find it always
to result free from alkali from
it's decomposition-
- We might generalize upon this
instance, - there are few rocks
that do not contain alkaline, or

[page]34|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00034|dnp03a333pp|75689321[/page]
or calcareous, or ferruginous matters
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] for instance contains all
these substances & it is a rock
continually decomposing at the
surface- - and alkali which abounds
in the solid stone, is not to be
found in the Porcelain earth
resulting from it's decomposition.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
We might apply the same mode
of reasoning to [chemical]chemical_125|Porphyry[/chemical], the
different [chemical]chemical_104|feldspars[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_120|Shists[/chemical], to Trap
& even to common [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical], one
of the elements of which as you
have seen is attracted in a high
degree by negatively electrified
surfaces-

and after these ideas much of that
gradual & superficial decay so
constantly occurring may well be
attributed to the almost continual
operation of feeble electrical powers
- and in this point of view, Electricity
becomes an agent in contributing
to the [underline]production,[/underline] continuance, &
renovation of [underline]those soils[/underline] which
are the beds of vegetable life
In [deletion]producing[/deletion] [insertion]compensating[/insertion] for that waste of
materials which is constantly
taking place in consequence of
the operation of water, in rains,
springs, torrents & rivers, by which
the finely divided parts of the
surface are washed from Hills
& plains into vallies & finally
carried into the sea -- So that

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00036|dnp03a335pp|75689323[/page]
if such conclusions be admitted, the
[underline]same cloud[/underline] which deposits that water
ultimately the source of the destruction
the soil - likewise induces that
Electricity ultimately the cause of
it's renovation - a happy & a
beautiful circumstance shewing how
accurately the powers of nature
are ballanced for the purpose
of life -
Shewing that no advances can be
made towards the discovery of the
hidden powers operating in the
material universe, without
develloping new views of the [deletion]xx[/deletion]power
wisdom [insertion]benevolence[/insertion] & wonderful combinations
by which it is regulated -

- : Having [deletion]mentioned[/deletion] [insertion]noticed[/insertion] the relations
of this subject to some of
the phaenomena of Nature
I shall likewise say a few
words of the application
of the processes of Electrical
decomposition to some of
the [underline]common Arts[/underline].
- In manufactures of
very [underline]delicate instruments[/underline] of
[chemical]chemical_323|Steel[/chemical] or iron - It has
always been a great
desideratum - That of
covering the imperfect metal
with a coating of perfect
metal such a Gold or [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical]
So as to preserve it
from, the action of air
Water or any external agent
which might occasion rust

[page]38|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00038|dnp03a337pp|75689325[/page]
-: In common cases the
[underline]Metallic oxide[/underline] has been
made to [underline]act either[/underline] by
being applied in the form
of powder or in solution -
-: Some time ago a method
[deletion]f[/deletion] of applying a solution of
gold in Ether was
sold as a technical
secret to several Artists
in [chemical]chemical_323|Steel[/chemical]. -
-. But this method as
well as every method of
the Kind has [deletion]the[/deletion] a great disadvantage
that the [underline]perfect[/underline] [underline]metal[/underline] cannot
be thrown down unless the
[underline]imperfect metal[/underline] be at
the same time oxidated.
-: So that the fineness
of the edge or the perfection
of the polish must be

-[superscript].[/superscript] But if the surface of
any [deletion]instrument be[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] made
[deletion]negative[/deletion] article to be covered
with gold or [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical] be
[underline]made negative[/underline]. - the perfect
metal will be deposited
without any injury done
to the perfect metal -
the polish, the point, the
edge will be preserved [insertion]untouched[/insertion] [deletion]perfect[/deletion]
- Instance.
[underline]a very weak solution[/underline]
- I venture to recommend this
method; to artists who are
employed in manufacturing
the finer kinds of Instruments
-. A hundred plates would
afford a power sufficient
to cover [deletion]a number of[/deletion] [insertion]several [/insertion]instruments

in the course of day.
[deletion]&[/deletion] the [deletion]expen[/deletion] additional expence
would be inconsiderable.
And in a commercial
point of view, the
highest degree of perfection
& elegance of the article
is no small object - For
to preserve & carry still
farther our preeminence
in the [insertion]useful[/insertion] [underline]arts[/underline] [deletion]most[/deletion]
[deletion]connected with the progression[/deletion]
[deletion]of the Society[/deletion] is to
preserve & exalt a source
of [deletion]Natural[/deletion]influence of wealth
& of power.-
- - I shall mention another
application of Electricity
- which I alluded to in
my course of lectures last
year -

[page]41|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00041|dnp03a340pp|75689328[/page]
The alkalies it is well known
are of very great importance
in a number of manufactures -
- In soap making, in glass making
bleaching & dyeing they are used
to a considerable extent & an
oeconomical mode of producing
them might be made an individual
benefit & a public advantage -
- Such a mode I have very
little doubt exists in the processes
of decomposition by Electricity.

it would be easily applicable
to the purposes of soap making

respect to the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] so[/deletion]
Hypothesis of the general
excitation of heat.
-. One notion was that
[underline]Heat[/underline] [deletion]was[/deletion] might be generated
[underline]or composed[/underline] of the two
electricities -
The other that it might
be merely [underline]the result[/underline] of
an approximation of

[deletion]in general[/deletion] whether produced

or electrical causes

[page]51|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00051|dnp03a350pp|75689338[/page]

. & chemical attraction - whether
these effects are produced
by [deletion]subtile material[/deletion] peculiar
subtile matter; or whether
they are [underline]qualities[/underline] capable
of being [deletion]produced[/deletion] [insertion]generated[/insertion] in or
communicated to every species
of body. -
-. .. Without entering minutely
upon this enquiry, I shall
mention some circumstances
which appear to bear immediately
upon the general subject of
this discussion & which may
afford considerable illustration
of what is perhaps the
most mysterious part of
physical Science.  -
-: In the battery with
large plates; [deletion][underline]Heat[/underline][/deletion] the wires
[underline]of [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical][/underline] seemed capable
of being preserved in constant
ignition -
- In the last lecture You

[page]52|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00052|dnp03a351pp|75689339[/page]
saw this ignition kept
up only for a minute,
I have since witnessed
the effect for many
minutes: - -
- You shall again judge
for yourselves whether it
does not appear to
be constant -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- Now if this heat were
owing merely to an
approximation of the
particles of the [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical],
these particles must
immediately gain
their extreme points of
union - & the effect
could not be permanent.
- . Or if Heat be considered
as a fluid pressed out by the

[page]53|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00053|dnp03a352pp|75689340[/page]
two electricities from the pores
[underline]of the metal[/underline]; the quantity
must be limited -
-. The ignition likewise
is independent of air
it takes place in a
[deletion]torrecellian[/deletion] Vacuum -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- It cannot be said then
that the heat is attracted
[deletion]by[/deletion] [insertion]from[/insertion] air & given out by
the metals -
- If Heat be material;
it is either generated
by or composed of the
two Electricities - or
if the two electricities
be merely exhibitions
of the natural attractive
powers of Matter; - then

[page]54|MS-DAVY-10303-000-00054|dnp03a353pp|75689341[/page]
Heat must likewise be
considered as a quality;
& the - [deletion]physical hypothesis[/deletion]

being motion, [deletion]to[/deletion] must
be preferred to that
of [person]person_388|Stahl[/person] of its being
a subtile & etherial
Matter. -
-. It is not a little
singular that you have
witnessed the devellopment
of an Hypothesis in one
lecture, & have seen
it compared with a
fact & rejected in
another lecture "
- Terrestrial Heat can
no longer [insertion]fairly[/insertion] be considered as
