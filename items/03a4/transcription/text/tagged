- [deletion]The Chemical enquirer, in[/deletion]

& last of all form [deletion]true[/deletion]
[underline]analogies[/underline], which may be

the [deletion]early[/deletion] first chemistry of modern

principle of inflammability
uniform in its properties checked
the progress of enquiry, & as

[deletion]nothing[/deletion]. It is a great
[deletion]object[/deletion] [deletion]matter[/deletion] That we should
put no improper confidence
