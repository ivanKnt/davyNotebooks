neutralizes a larger quantity of oxygene

at a low one, but when the
common temperature is restored
then the negative energy of the
oxygene is more than sufficient
to balance the positive energy
of the Sulphur; & hence
the whole compound is negative .-
- It may be asked in this
assumption, Why do not Sulphur
& oxygene combine in various
