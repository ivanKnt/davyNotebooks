There are different degrees of
energy. To this question no other
answer can be given [insertion]but that[/insertion] when two
bodies combine there must be
some determinate proportion of their
particles either 1 & 1 or 1 & 2 or
1 & 3 - [deletion]or is[/deletion] It is a [underline]fact[/underline]
that they [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]can[/insertion] not combine
in all proportions - It does not enfold
an objection to the theory of Electrochemical
attraction, any more than to the
theory of common chemical attraction.
Indeed the same general principles
of reasoning must apply to
[underline]both.[/underline]
Sulphur & oxygene are [deletion][insertion]the particles[/insertion][/deletion] capable
of attracting each other & this
power of attraction / is on the ideas
that I have been stating, conceived
to be the same as the power
by which they produce electrical
effects - In chemical phenomena
