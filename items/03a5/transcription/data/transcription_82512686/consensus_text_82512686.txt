- Oxygene, Hyd : [underline]peculiar basis[/underline]. -
analogous to, Resin oils, - conducting
power - semitransparency, fluidity -
but its basis has a higher
affinity for oxygene than charcoal
& would probably be metallic
[deletion]&[/deletion] or a conductor of electricity
as [deletion]charcoal[/deletion] plumbago is . -
- Here facts minister to analogies - Science
coincides with [underline]common observation[/underline];
To [delection]find[/deletion] discover this basis
to procure it in its pure
form will be a labour
[deletion]to[/deletion] which may long occupy the
ingenuity of Chemists; for in
this case as in all others
[deletion]discoveries[/deletion] novel facts bring with them
