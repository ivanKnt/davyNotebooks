[page]6|MS-DAVY-10305-000-00006|dnp03a506pp|82512680[/page]

Sulphuric , Sulphureous nomenclature
- In the [underline]electrochemical Theory[/underline]
[deletion]It is supposed that[/deletion]
the different combinations
of [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] with [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] are
accounted for in the [deletion]supposition[/deletion] [insertion]fact[/insertion],
that the [deletion]different[/deletion] [insertion]positive[/insertion] energy of

[deletion]as it were absorbs a larger[/deletion]
neutralizes a larger quantity of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
at a high temperature than
at a low one, but when the
common temperature is restored
then the negative energy of the
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] is more than sufficient
to balance the positive energy
of the [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical]; & hence
the whole compound is negative .-
- It may be asked in this
assumption, Why do not [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical]
& [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] combine in various

There are different degrees of
energy. To this question no other
answer can be given [insertion]but that[/insertion] when two
bodies combine there must be
some determinate proportion of their
particles either 1 & 1 or 1 & 2 or
1 & 3 - [deletion]or is[/deletion] It is a [underline]fact[/underline]
that they [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]can[/insertion] not combine
in all proportions - It does not enfold
an objection to the theory of Electrochemical
attraction, any more than to the
theory of common chemical attraction.
Indeed the same general principles
of reasoning must apply to
[underline]both.[/underline]
[chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] are [deletion][insertion]the particles[/insertion][/deletion] capable
of attracting each other & this
power of attraction ( is on the ideas
that I have been starting), conceived
to be the same as the power
by which they produce electrical
effects - In chemical phenomena

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10305-000-00010|dnp03a510pp|82512684[/page]
it acts on the particles, in
electrical phaenomena on the
masses. - The positive electricity
of [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] is known to be
exalted by heat .- Its
powers of uniting with [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
are increased by the same
means the two series of
effects shew the same
order & therefore it is
inferred that they may depend
upon the same law.-
- On the [underline]antiphlogistic[/underline] Theory
[chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] was considered as
a simple [underline]substance[/underline] according
to that first method of
Philosophising which admits
nothing without proof - [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical]
had never been decompounded
& though an explanation
of the facts might be
given [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] general
principle &c -
