this lecture to Sulphur &
Phosphorus, their powers their

- Sulphur has been known
from the earliest ages - [deletion]of[/deletion] It

for nearly the same purposes
as by the moderns - It is
found native in many parts of
the world & particularly in

- The first modern Chemists who
examined Sulphur discovered
that when the vapours
were received over water the
water became [underline]Sour[/underline]. -

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10305-000-00006|dnp03a506pp|82512680[/page]
& it was [insertion]soon[/insertion]ascertained by Glauber
Beccher & Stahl, that the
acid matter formed was the
same as that produced by
the distillation of [chemical]chemical_352|green vitriol[/chemical].
& called oil of vitriol or
vitriolic acid.-
Vitriolic acid soon after
it was discovered was brought
into use in various manufactures
particularly in dying Hatmaking
& the Solution of Metals - Many
persons [deletion]Attempted[/deletion], with the
hopes of procuring it at a
cheap rate &c. [unclear]but[/unclear]
[underline]failed[/underline] -
Hence it was discovered
that there were two substances

of weight & therefore overturned Stahls
theory - 1 parts of Sulphur
1 Oxygene

1 Oxygene . -
Sulphuric , Sulphureous nomenclature
- In the [underline]electrochemical Theory[/underline]
[deletion]It is supposed that[/deletion]
the different combinations
of Sulphur with oxygene are
accounted for in the [deletion]supposition[/deletion] [insertion]fact[/insertion],
that the [deletion]different[/deletion] [insertion]positive[/insertion] energy of
Sulphur [deletion]& Phosphorus are[/deletion] [insertion]with respect to oxygene is[/insertion]
[deletion]as it were absorbs a larger[/deletion]
neutralizes a larger quantity of oxygene
at a high temperature than
at a low one, but when the
common temperature is restored
then the negative energy of the
oxygene is more than sufficient
to balance the positive energy
of the Sulphur; & hence
the whole compound is negative .-
- It may be asked in this
assumption, Why do not Sulphur
& oxygene combine in various

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10305-000-00009|dnp03a509pp|82512683[/page]
120
proportions [insertion]different [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] when sulphur is heated / as[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]are[/unclear][/deletion] [deletion]there[/deletion] many as
There are different degrees of
energy. To this question no other
answer can be given [insertion]but that[/insertion] when two
bodies combine there must be
some determinate proportion of their
particles either 1 & 1 or 1 & 2 or
1 & 3 - [deletion]or is[/deletion] It is a [underline]fact[/underline]
that they [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]can[/insertion] not combine
in all proportions - It does not enfold
an objection to the theory of Electrochemical
attraction, any more than to the
theory of common chemical attraction.
Indeed the same general principles
of reasoning must apply to
[underline]both.[/underline]
Sulphur & oxygene are [deletion][insertion]the particles[/insertion][/deletion] capable
of attracting each other & this
power of attraction / is on the ideas
that I have been stating, conceived
to be the same as the power
by which they produce electrical
effects - In chemical phenomena

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10305-000-00010|dnp03a510pp|82512684[/page]
it acts on the particles, in
electrical phaenomena on the
masses. - The positive electricity
of sulphur is known to be
exalted by heat .- Its
powers of uniting with oxygene
are increased by the same
means the two series of
effects shew the same
order & therefore it is
inferred that they may depend
upon the same law.-
- On the [underline]antiphlogistic[/underline] Theory
Sulphur was considered as
a simple [underline]substance[/underline] according
to that first method of
Philosophising which admits
nothing without proof - Sulphur
had never been decompounded
& though an explanation
of the facts might be
given Hydrogene general
principle &c -

Sulphur is still considered as

exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] however induce me

be unsatisfactory -
