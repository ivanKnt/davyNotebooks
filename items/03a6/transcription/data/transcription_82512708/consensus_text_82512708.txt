- With respect to all the
combinations of oxygene & Nitrogene
the general theory of combustion
which I have already
developed will fully apply.
- The energy [insertion]of attraction[/insertion] of the inflammable
body must be considered
as superior to that
of Nitrogene; & perhaps
in no instances [deletion]are[/deletion] is
the exaltation of the
attractive power by Heat
more distinctly shown. -
- Sulphur I have already
stated has its [insertion]positive[/insertion] energy
& its components [insertion]consequently[/insertion] its power of attracting
oxygene strongly exalted
by increasing of temperature
