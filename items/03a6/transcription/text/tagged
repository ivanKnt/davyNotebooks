us in the course of our enquiries

a very small quantity of vapour;
[deletion]but[/deletion] the superior moisture

of the difference, of the clouds

the general theory of combustion
which I have already

[deletion]yet it is in harmony with[/deletion]
[deletion]a number of other chemical[/deletion]
[deletion]facts; which [unclear]fact[/unclear] considered[/deletion]

[deletion]that the elementary materials[/deletion]

- |_ [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical] & Nitrous acid again

to the compounds of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_054|Carbon[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
these facts render it probable
" that substances, which we
at present conceive to consist
of [underline]different[/underline] species of
matter may ultimately be

[deletion]the enquiry it may[/deletion]
[deletion]natur[/deletion] In considering this
department of philosophical [deletion]ly[/deletion]
discussion it may [deletion]with[/deletion]
[deletion]purpose[/deletion] naturally be asked
Is [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical] itself
an Elementary substance
or is there a probability
of its being a compound?
-.- It is unprofitable in
the present state of our
knowledge to answer this
question decidedly; - but

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10306-000-00017|dnp03a617pp|82512715[/page]
136
the few analogies & facts that
we propose in the subject strongly
favour [underline]the opinion[/underline] that
it is not a [underline]simple[/underline]
body.
- Its [deletion][unclear]has[/unclear][/deletion] slight tendencies
to combination, its want
of inflammability though
its particles possess an entire
freedom of action, - [deletion]Its[/deletion] the
feebleness with which it
adheres to [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], are
circumstances in favour of
its containing some of
this principle already in
combination -
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] gas & the gases
& fluids consisting principally

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10306-000-00018|dnp03a618pp|82512716[/page]
of pure inflammable matter
[deletion][unclear]has very high[/unclear][/deletion] possess very high
powers in refracting light;
[deletion]if[/deletion] the powers, of [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical] on
the contrary are low, like
those of bodies which
contain [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]. -
- In addition, to the
[underline]New[/underline]
evidence derived from these
qualities; there are some
cases in which [deletion]compounds[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical], when [deletion]deprived[/deletion]
a compound in which
it exists is deprived

the agency of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], or bodies

[deletion]upon what this basis[/deletion]
[deletion]is;[/deletion] [insertion]is [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical], or a body analogous to [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical][/insertion] but I trust before
the conclusion of this course
to be able to give some distinct
[deletion]decided[/deletion] information upon the
subject.

not be subservient to other
important purposes besides
that of merely diluting
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] gas - It is dissolved

It enters, largely into the
