us in the course of our enquiries

a very small quantity of vapour;
[deletion]but[/deletion] the superior moisture

of the difference, of the clouds

already cursorily mentioned
to you in the lecture
on Oxygene. - It forms

[deletion]yet it is in harmony with[/deletion]
[deletion]a number of other chemical[/deletion]
[deletion]facts; which [unclear]fact[/unclear] considered[/deletion]
[deletion]together render it probable[/deletion]
[deletion]that the elementary materials[/deletion]
[deletion]of our globe [deletion]are much[/deletion] may[/deletion]
[deletion]be much fewer than [deletion]we[/deletion][/deletion]
[deletion]are now accustomed to[/deletion]
consider them
- |_ Nitrous gas & Nitrous acid again
though composed of the
same elements, [deletion]aga[/deletion] yet are
[underline]themselves[/underline], capable of [underline]combination[/underline]
[deletion]of[/deletion] as if they consisted
of distinct [deletion]elements[/deletion] [insertion]materials[/insertion] |_And
combined with analogous facts [unclear]respecting[/unclear]
to the compounds of Hydrogene carbon & oxygene
these facts render it probable
" that substances, which we
at present conceive to consist
of [underline]different[/underline] species of
matter may ultimately be

[page]16||dnp03a616pp|82512714[/page]
referred to [underline]different[/underline] proportions
of [underline]similar[/underline] species, & in this
way the science of the
composition of bodies materially
simplified.
-[deletion]In [deletion]pursuing[/deletion] [insertion]considering[/insertion] this part of[/deletion]
[deletion]the enquiry it may[/deletion]
[deletion]natur[/deletion] In considering this
department of philosophical [deletion]ly[/deletion]
discussion it may [deletion]with[/deletion]
[deletion]purpose[/deletion] naturally be asked
Is Nitrogene itself
an Elementary substance
or is there a probability
of its being a compound?
-.- It is unprofitable in
the present state of our
knowledge to answer this
question decidedly; - but

[page]17||dnp03a617pp|82512715[/page]
136
the few analogies & facts that
we propose in the subject strongly
favour [underline]the opinion[/underline] that
it is not a [underline]simple[/underline]
body.
- Its [deletion][unclear]has[/unclear][/deletion] slight tendencies
to combination, its want
of inflammability though
its particles possess an entire
freedom of action, - [deletion]Its[/deletion] the
feebleness with which it
adheres to oxygene, are
circumstances in favour of
its containing some of
this principle already in
combination -
Hydrogene gas & the gases
& fluids consisting principally

[page]18||dnp03a618pp|82512716[/page]
of pure inflammable matter
[deletion][unclear]has very high[/unclear][/deletion] possess very high
powers in refracting light;
[deletion]if[/deletion] the powers, of Nitrogene on
the contrary are low, like
those of bodies which
contain oxygene. -
- In addition, to the
[underline]New[/underline]
evidence derived from these
qualities; there are some
cases in which [deletion]compounds[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] Nitrogene, when [deletion]deprived[/deletion]
a compound in which
it exists is deprived
of Oxygene [deletion]assumes[/deletion] [insertion]takes[/insertion] the
metallic form; & can
only be made to
assume [insertion]its natural state [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [/insertion] [deletion]the form of[/deletion] by

the agency of oxygene, or bodies
containing oxygene: - I [deletion]am[/deletion] am
[deletion]at this moment[/deletion]
at every moment of leisure
pursuing this enquiry &
endeavouring to obtain the
basis in a pure [deletion]form[/deletion] [insertion]state[/insertion]
The only suspicion that I can
[deletion]I will not offer any suspicions[/deletion]
now form is that the basis
[deletion]upon what this basis[/deletion]
[deletion]is;[/deletion] [insertion]is Hydrogene, or a body analogous to Hydrogene[/insertion] but I trust before
the conclusion of this course
to be able to give some distinct
[deletion]decided[/deletion] information upon the
subject.
|_After Oxygene few substances
are of more importance in
the Oeconomy of Nature
than Nitrogene. Forming
so great a part of our

[page]20||dnp03a620pp|82512718[/page]
Atmosphere, it is scarcely possible
to conceive that it must
not be subservient to other
important purposes besides
that of merely diluting
oxygene gas - It is dissolved
in the waters of the
sea of lakes springs & rivers,
It enters, largely into the
composition of some vegetables
& of all animals, & it
is extremely probable that
[deletion]many[/deletion] great phaenomena
[deletion]of Nature[/deletion], now obscure
such as the renovation
of air, Rain & Respiration
would [deletion][unclear]all[/unclear][/deletion] be [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] solved
