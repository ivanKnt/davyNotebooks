[underline]Muriatic acid[/underline].
- [underline]platina[/underline] & Nitromuriatic
[underline]acid[/underline]..
66 oxygene 43 muriatic
acid -
supports combustion better
than common [underline]oxymuriatic[/underline] acid.-
[underline]Hydrogene[/underline] [underline]Detonations[/underline] [underline]Phosphorus[/underline]
- We have seen muriatic
acid in two states of
combination [underline]with oxygene[/underline].; but
is the [underline]primary acid[/underline] itself
a simple body does it
not itself consist of
Oxygene united to a particular
basis.-
- This all analogy would
induce us to suppose like
Phosphoric, Sulphuric & Nitric
acid it passes in the
voltaic circuit to the positive
surface & in all its affections
