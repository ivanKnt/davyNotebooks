This lecture will
be devoted to [deletion]the[/deletion] [deletion]examination[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] the [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_238|Boracic[/chemical]
acid - & to the changes
which they undergoe when
examined by the new powers
of analysis.-
I have to bring before
you several facts of a very
recent [deletion]discovery[/deletion] [insertion]acquirement[/insertion] - Should
my details be longer
& more tedious than usual
I shall trust for an apology
to your zeal in promoting

[deletion]my object will be to demonstrate[/deletion]
& some of the researches
[deletion]to you[/deletion] researches [deletion]which[/deletion]
 which I shall enter upon
are only in part compleated.
-. The [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] [deletion]has[/deletion] was
known to the chemists of
the 15 century under
the name of spirits of
Salt; It has been called
likewise [chemical]chemical_016|Marine acid[/chemical].-
No process in Chemistry
is more simple than that
of procuring it.
