This lecture will
be devoted to [deletion]the[/deletion] [deletion]examination[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] the Muriatic acid & Boracic
acid - & to the changes
which they undergoe when
examined by the new powers
of analysis.-
I have to bring before
you several facts of a very
recent [deletion]discovery[/deletion] [insertion]acquirement[/insertion] - Should
my details be longer

[deletion]my object will be to demonstrate[/deletion]
& some of the researches
[deletion]to you[/deletion] researches [deletion]which[/deletion]
 which I shall enter upon
are only in part compleated.
-. The Muriatic acid [deletion]has[/deletion] was
known to the chemists of
the 15 century under
the name of spirits of
Salt; It has been called
likewise marine acid.-
No process in Chemistry
is more simple than that
of procuring it.

Chemists of the last century
was owing to his
examining oxymuriatic acid
with too little caution
- He suffered some to escape
in his laboratory & respired
the air polluted by it;
It produced a most violent
fit of coughing & an inflammatory
state of the lungs which
was destructive to a delicate
constitution & which [deletion]with[/deletion] in

of destroying almost all

is the [underline]primary acid[/underline] itself
a simple body does it
not itself consist of
Oxygene united to a particular

- This all analogy would
induce us to suppose like

acid it passes in the

surface & in all its affections
