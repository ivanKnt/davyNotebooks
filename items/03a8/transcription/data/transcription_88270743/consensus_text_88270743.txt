good with respect to all
the species - Silver leaf
of 100 000 of an inch
thick does not transmit
any light when held between
the Sun & the eye - , A
piece of basalt appears opaque
in a Mass but a fragment
only 1/10 of an inch thick
will transmit a considerable
portion of light - The opacity
of metals is not however
absolute. gold leaf 1/280,000
of transmits green light
All matter must possess
pores & a plate may
as in this instance be
so thin as to admit
certain rays to pass
through them. -
- The splendour of Metals
differs exceedingly in degree
