- The ores of silver & gold are much
more easily worked than those of copper
& [deletion]zinc[/deletion] [insertion]lead[/insertion] & those of copper & of [deletion]zinc[/deletion] [insertion]lead[/insertion] are

acknowledged the connection of the
progress of civilization with the discovery
of the metals, they have heightened the
links extravagantly in [insertion]one[/insertion][deletion]the[/deletion] picture & have
thrown the other into [deletion]the[/deletion] shade & like
some of their brethren amongst the poets
