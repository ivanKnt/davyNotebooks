& between the metal of

than [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical] does to Gold. -

-:- The opacity of metals as compared
with those of other bodies
is a character which holds

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00004|dnp03a804pp|88270743[/page]
good with respect to all
the species - Silver leaf
of 100 000 of an inch
thick does not transmit
any light when held between
the Sun & the eye - , A
piece of [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] appears opaque
in a Mass but a fragment
only 1/10 of an inch thick
will transmit a considerable
portion of light - The opacity
of metals is not however

they have been increasing,

are daily becoming more

- The first metals discovered
there is every reason to believe
were [deletion]of[/deletion] gold & silver, they
are found native in the

[underline]antiquity[/underline]; & had they
possessed no immediate
uses, their brilliancy
alone, would have arrested

ornament.-

- The ores of silver & gold are much

melted with infinitely greater facility
than those of iron, so that probably
considerable periods elapsed between the
discovery of the precious & of the more

circumstance that the Greek bards
have founded the fable of the four ages

iron. | but in adopting the license of
a bold imagination, they have materially
altered the facts /_: & although they have
acknowledged the connection of the

of the metals, they have heightened the

[chemical]chemical_377|orichalcum[/chemical] probably contained the largest
proportion of [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] & this substance was
considered as by far the most valuable &
as resembling gold in it's properties, and
[deletion]thi[/deletion] was used for ornament, whilst the
common hard [chemical]chemical_321|Brass[/chemical] was principally employed
in the fabrication of Arms. - Lead is noticed

- Metals will precipitate each

-.The power of the oxides to

The oxides of iron [insertion][chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical][/insertion] precipitate
the oxides of [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical], gold
& silver & so on for

It sometimes happens
that in precipitation,
the alkali or the oxide
[deletion][unclear]combines[/unclear][/deletion] which precipitates
falls down in part
with the precipitate
& forms a new compound

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00036|dnp03a836pp|88270775[/page]
I am inclined to believe
that the [chemical]chemical_387|fulminating gold[/chemical],
was often employed by
[underline]those alchemical[/underline] Imposters
who professed[deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]that they[/insertion] possessed
the secret "of the grand

& who [insertion]practised upon[/insertion] [deletion]when employed[/deletion]
[deletion]by[/deletion] the ignorant & the
credulous a system of
deceit & robbery.
-In reading the [deletion]history of[/deletion]
narratives of their exploits
it almost always happened;
that about the time
that they had exhausted
the purses of their
employers, an unfortunate
explosion usually took place

the [deletion]operation[/deletion] process had failed,
though the [underline]near[/underline] accomplishment

Metals certainly simple bodies
& is there is no probability
of their being generated

- On this subject it
is necessary to make some
distinctions - (with respect

of the alchemists, who

of the [misc]misc_381|Philosophers stone[/misc], there
cannot [deletion]be two[/deletion] [underline]opinions[/underline].-
(Nothing [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]can[/insertion] be stronger or
more just than what Lemery
