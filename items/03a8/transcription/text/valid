of Potash is considerably lighter

the species - Silver leaf

thick does not transmit
any light when held between
the Sun & the eye - , A
piece of basalt appears opaque
in a Mass but a fragment

the property is an universal

(-To common experience some
of the Metals particularly

[deletion]- The number of the metals[/deletion]
[deletion]has been constantly enlarging[/deletion]
- I may be expected to say
something, concerning the [insertion]precise[/insertion] [underline]number[/underline]
of the metals; but this is
not a very [underline]definite subject[/underline].
- They have been increasing

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00014|dnp03a814pp|88270753[/page]
they have been increasing,
since the earliest periods
of chemical research; &
are daily becoming more
extensive -
- The first metals discovered
there is every reason to believe
were [deletion]of[/deletion] gold & silver, they
are found native in the
countries the most advanced
in [underline][deletion]civilization[/deletion] [insertion]population[/insertion] in remote[/underline]
[underline]antiquity[/underline]; & had they
possessed no immediate
uses, their brilliancy
alone, would have arrested
the attention of uncultivated

ornament.-

- The ores of silver & gold are much
more easily worked than those of copper
& [deletion]zinc[/deletion] [insertion]lead[/insertion] & those of copper & of [deletion]zinc[/deletion] [insertion]lead[/insertion] are
melted with infinitely greater facility
than those of iron, so that probably
considerable periods elapsed between the
discovery of the precious & of the more
useful metals It seems to be on this
circumstance that the Greek bards
have founded the fable of the four ages
those of gold, of silver, of brass & of
iron. | but in adopting the license of
a bold imagination, they have materially
altered the facts /_: & although they have
acknowledged the connection of the
progress of civilization with the discovery
of the metals, they have heightened the
links extravagantly in [insertion]one[/insertion][deletion]the[/deletion] picture & have
thrown the other into [deletion]the[/deletion] shade & like

the solitary manners of the pastoral Nations
far above the refinements of extended social
enjoyment & the blessings of [deletion]an[/deletion] active life.
(In the sacred writings of Moses four metals
are mentioned as in common use amongst the
the Egyptians & Isralites Gold, Silver
brass & Iron)-| From the descriptions of
the Iliad it is evident that the Greeks
of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]this[/insertion] period were not only in the
possession of Iron, but likewise of two
different species of brass of which the
orichalcum probably contained the largest
proportion of copper & this substance was
considered as by far the most valuable &
as resembling gold in it's properties, and
[deletion]thi[/deletion] was used for ornament, whilst the
common hard brass was principally employed
in the fabrication of Arms. - Lead is noticed
as an ignoble & useless metal, but Tin
appears to have been of considerable
application. It [insertion]was combined with copper in[/insertion] [deletion]entered into the[/deletion] [underline]alloy of[/underline]

which Vulcan is described [insertion]as[/insertion] making great

Such specula were employed both in Greece

substituted for bronze

[deletion]the principles of metallic solution[/deletion]
[deletion]I shall state them more particularly[/deletion]

[deletion]but I trust they have already[/deletion]
[deletion]had the goodness to make[/deletion]
[deletion]an apology for me, I am[/deletion]
[deletion]delivering an elementary course.[/deletion]
-. Instance
[underline]Iron[/underline] oxide -
You have seen metallic solutions
carried on - I shall
state the principles
[deletion]-[underline]precipitation[/underline]- by [underline]an alkali[/underline][/deletion]
- Metals will precipitate each
other. [underline]Iron[/underline] [underline]copper[/underline]-
power is in the ratio of
their [insertion]positive[/insertion] electrical
Tin foil & [underline]Nitrate[/underline] of [underline]Copper[/underline]-

[page]34|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00034|dnp03a834pp|88270773[/page]
-.The power of the oxides to
precipitate each other
is likewise nearly in the
same [underline]ratio[/underline].- [deletion]Thus Potassium[/deletion]
& [deletion]the xxxx acid[/deletion] Thus [deletion]Po[/deletion] Barytes, [unclear]Strontites[/unclear]
Potash soda, Lime, are the
oxides of the most oxidable
Known Metals they precipitate
all the other oxides -
The oxides of iron [insertion]Zinc & tin[/insertion] precipitate
the oxides of mercury, gold
& silver & so on for
the rest.-
It sometimes happens
that in precipitation,
the alkali or the oxide
[deletion][unclear]combines[/unclear][/deletion] which precipitates
falls down in part
with the precipitate
& forms a new compound

[page]35|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00035|dnp03a835pp|88270774[/page]
167
or the precipitate is [unclear]redissolved[/unclear].
- This is the case in
particular in precipitations
by the Volatile alkali.
Instance -
& their compounds consisting
of matter of which the attractive
powers corresponding to the [deletion]fr[/deletion]
positive & negative energies
are easily brought into
equilibrium detonate or

heat or friction -
[underline]Fulminating[/underline] gold
[underline]Silver[/underline] -
[underline]Quicksilver[/underline]
-. When any of these substances
are made to detonate
in the inside of a glass retort [insertion]exhausted[/insertion]

Coated with metal.
Instance

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00036|dnp03a836pp|88270775[/page]
I am inclined to believe
that the fulminating gold,
was often employed by
[underline]those alchemical[/underline] Imposters
who professed[deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]that they[/insertion] possessed
the secret "of the grand
operation of transmutation,"
& who [insertion]practised upon[/insertion] [deletion]when employed[/deletion]
[deletion]by[/deletion] the ignorant & the
credulous a system of
deceit & robbery.
-In reading the [deletion]history of[/deletion]
narratives of their exploits
it almost always happened;
that about the time
that they had exhausted
the purses of their
employers, an unfortunate
explosion usually took place

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10308-000-00037|dnp03a837pp|88270776[/page]
168
& the dupe was informed
that in consequence of the
want of a little more of
the powder of a projection,
the [deletion]operation[/deletion] process had failed,
though the [underline]near[/underline] accomplishment
of it was [underline]proved[/underline] by the gold
[deletion]gold[/deletion] dissipated on the vessels.,-
(& the result was equally
calculated to keep alive
[deletion]the[/deletion] folly & to nourish
the most absurd hopes.-

[deletion]In concluding this[/deletion]
[underline]lecture[/underline], [deletion]I can hardly avoid[/deletion] [insertion]I cannot pass over this subject[/insertion]

question [deletion]which what I have[/deletion][insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] if we take transmutation[/insertion]

Metals certainly simple bodies
& is there is no probability
of their being generated
from other elements? -
- On this subject it
is necessary to make some
distinctions - (with respect
to the views of the [underline]adepts[/underline],)
of the alchemists, who
pretended to be in possession
of the Philosophers stone, there
cannot [deletion]be two[/deletion] [underline]opinions[/underline].-
(Nothing [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]can[/insertion] be stronger or
more just than what Lemery
said of these men, "That
they professed An Art [underline]without[/underline]
[underline]principles[/underline], the beginning of
which was [underline]deceit[/underline], the progress
of which, was [underline]falshood[/underline], & the

(Who, considering, the metals
as [underline]generated, beneath[/underline] the

their views, towards the
discovery of these [deletion]operations[/deletion] processes
& had for their highest object
the construction, of a laboratory
