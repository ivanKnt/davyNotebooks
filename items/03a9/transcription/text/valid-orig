Electrochemical - Introduction

Since I last had the honour of
addressing an Audience in
this place at this hour, [underline]That[/underline]
[underline]Science[/underline] which it has been the
object of my life to endeavour
to cultivate & demonstrate, in
a manner which may worthy of public
[deletion]you[/deletion] attention & [deletion]your[/deletion] approbation
has undergone a very considerable
alteration has been improved
& extended. -
- In the evening course of
lectures on Galvanism which
I delivered in 1804, I continually
dwelt upon the importance of
the Voltaic battery, as an Instrument
of research, & I stated - "that objects
of discovery, in Chemistry, could

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00002|dnp03a902pp|75689347[/page]
hardly fail of being attained,
by the connection of that
Science with Electricity. -
How far, these view have
been [underline]realized[/underline], I shall [insertion]now[/insertion] endeavor,
to shew (And I trust I
shall be able to prove,
that the [underline]interest[/underline] which the
audiences in this theatre, so
[underline]Kindly[/underline] expressed "with regard
to this branch of Science, at
an early period of its existence,
when it was still in
a state of infancy, has not
been without [underline]effect[/underline], has not
been [underline]ungratefully[/underline] received; nor
[deletion]not been[/deletion] [underline]unworthily[/underline] bestowed.
- In demonstrating the facts
& the principles of [underline]Electrochemical[/underline]

did no less for the peculiar

Gilbert, Electrical machines
were [underline]contrived[/underline] by [deletion]Otto der Guericke[/deletion]

were observed & stated; more
however calculated to excite

american Philosopher, to possess

an active effect in many [deletion]of[/deletion]
[deletion]the[/deletion] meteorological appearances;
- but for nearly 50 years after
[deletion]Chemist[/deletion] there were no analogies; which
connected Electricity with the
general philosophy of Corpuscular
changes - (Like [underline]magnetism[/underline] it
was regarded as a specific
power. - It was used [deletion]for[/deletion] by
the chemist to produce
certain [deletion]decompositions[/deletion] [insertion]changes[/insertion]; but the
effect was considered as
dependent upon the [underline]fire[/underline]
which it evolved; (& though
it was known to [deletion]produce[/deletion] [insertion]occasion[/insertion]
infinitely diversified effects
of Attraction & repulsion;
yet these could not [deletion]easily[/deletion] [insertion]at that time[/insertion]
be associated with the chemical

- It is not a little remarkable
that the train of facts which
led to the connexion of
Chemistry with Electricity was
of a perfectly novel kind, & such
as at first view appeared
to have [deletion]little[/deletion] no distinct relation to
either of these Sciences. -
- Galvani professor of Natural
Philosophy of Bologna happened
[deletion]in some physiological exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion]
to touch the crural nerve
of a dead frog with a knife
violent contractions were produced
in the leg - He tried other
metals with similar effects
& He found combinations of
metals (two metals for instance
 much more efficacious than
single metals. -
This is the form of
his ex[superscript]pt[/superscript].
[underline]Instance[/underline]. -

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00018|dnp03a918pp|75689363[/page]
- The fact was first made known
in 1789. - & its extraordinary
nature -" for living action
appeared to be given to
organs in a dead state
immediately arrested the
Attention of Scientific men;
- a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] experiments
were made in relation to
it & from the name of
the Discoverer, the subject
[deletion]was[/deletion] of discussion was called
Galvanism.
- It will be needless "to
dwell upon the various premature
& inaccurate views; which naturally
arose in the early stage of
the enquiry: - (Several philosophers
supposed [underline]the Galvanic[/underline] influence to
be a [underline]peculiar etherial fluid[/underline]
the [underline]source of irritability[/underline]; - (This

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00019|dnp03a919pp|75689364[/page]
10
opinion was adopted by the
celebrated Traveller Humbolt, who
published in a large octavo in
which it supported with great
zeal -. Galvani himself
conceived "that the nerves
& muscles of animals were like
the leyden Phial in different
states of Electricity, & that
the [underline]metals[/underline] [deletion]were[/deletion] [underline]acted[/underline] merely [insertion]as[/insertion] conductors
& produced a discharge of
which, muscular contraction
was a consequence. - [underline]Volta[/underline]
- who pursued, the subject
in the cautious spirit of
true philosophy "opposed these
ideas; & endeavoured to
shew by direct exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that
the effect was an electrical
effect produced by the
contact of [underline]the metals[/underline];
& that the nerves & muscles
acted as an Electrometer.
- Glass & silk it is well

known become electrical by
being pressed one against
the other, so likewise said
Volta do Tin & Silver. -
- The glass of the electrical
machine produces a contraction
in the [deletion]nerve[/deletion] [insertion]muscles[/insertion] of a Frog; which
is [insertion]one of[/insertion] the most vivacious of
animals; so likewise [deletion]do[/deletion]
(said Volta does, the [deletion]zinc[/deletion]
Tin or the silver in
this new electrical combination. -

There is still some remains of
life in the limb for the

unless the animal be recently
killed; & the electricity
acts merely as a powerful
stimulus. -

began to investigate Galvanism

namely between 1780 & 1790 M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Bennet had shewn by means of
a very beautiful Instrument (the Doubler
[deletion]the[/deletion] [underline]gold leaf Electrometer[/underline]; that
[deletion]the[/deletion] metals did actually become
electrical by contact; but
this discovery was neglected; - Though
if the Italian Enquirers had
referred to the English Experimenter
they might [insertion]immediately[/insertion] have found an obvious
solution of the new facts. -
- One of the simplest of
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bennets exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] was to touch
a plate of copper by the blade
of a Knife. -
- [underline]Instance[/underline].
- The copper will give the electrometer
a slight [deletion]charge[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]of[/deletion] electrical effect[/insertion] similar to
that which is produced by
the contact of [deletion]sealing wax[/deletion]. -
Amber. -

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00022|dnp03a922pp|75689367[/page]
- M[superscript]r[/superscript] Fabroni of Florence was
I believe one of the first Persons
who shewed, the connection
of [underline]Chemical[/underline] changes with the
electrical [deletion]contact[/deletion] [insertion]operation[/insertion] of Metals. -
- It is well known that
[underline]Zinc[/underline] becomes covered with
a white crust when exposed
to air & water. - M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Fabroni & D[superscript]r[/superscript] Ash shewed that
it was produced more
rapidly when the Zinc was
in contact with silver. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
& M[superscript]r[/superscript] Ritter demonstrated
that one point of contact
was [underline]sufficient[/underline]. -
Instance
A number of other instances
were soon brought forward. (It is

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00023|dnp03a923pp|75689368[/page]
12
well known - "that the iron nails
used for fastening the copper sheeting
upon ships are extremely liable
to rust. - This is from
the same cause.
Instance
Culinary vessels that are tinned
[deletion]begin to[/deletion] decay very rapidly
when a surface of the iron
is exposed. - The principle
of Galvanism has had many
other popular illustrations -.
Thus it has been said
that [deletion]porter[/deletion] the common notion
of "porter being more palatable
when taken out of a pewter
pot, depends upon the electrical
& chemical changes produced by
the metal; & on this idea
the "best [underline]cup or[/underline] [underline]Goblet[/underline] for
drinking porter [deletion]from would[/deletion] would
be one having a lip of silver
or Gold; - & really as this beverage

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00024|dnp03a924pp|75689369[/page]
is now a day made some such
aid for making it more
agreable to the taste is not
[deletion]perhaps[/deletion] to be despised. -"
(The opinion of the influence
of galvanic [insertion]processes[/insertion] [deletion]effects[/deletion] in the
chemical & sensible qualities
of bodies [deletion]was[/deletion] has been carried
by some persons to a length that
is [insertion]almost[/insertion] [deletion]very[/deletion] ridiculous - Thus it
is said in the Appendix to
 the Encyclopedia Britanica, that
a pinch of snuff has a different
flavour; when taken out of
a [underline]metallic box[/underline]. - If this
effect is [deletion]a[/deletion] real it can
only be remotely connected
with [deletion]the[/deletion] the galvanic phaenomena;
for there can be no immediate
communication, of Electricity
from the Metal. -
[deletion]Since I last had the honour[/deletion]

Silzer of Berlin in his theory
of pleasures published about the
middle of the last century
had observed that a piece
of Zinc & a piece of
Silver, applied separately to
the tongue & afterwards brought
in contact occasioned a
slightly acid taste. -
[deletion]This was referred by Fabroni[/deletion]
 [deletion]& Creve to oxydation of the[/deletion] Zinc
[deletion]& quoted by them in support[/deletion]
[deletion]of their doctrine[/deletion]. - This is
[deletion]however merely[/deletion] the exhibition
of a slight degree of electricity

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10309-000-00026|dnp03a926pp|75689371[/page]
- This fact is identical
with the galvanic fact
& if it had lead
to the same investigations
would have [deletion]been[/deletion] the
[deletion]origin[/deletion] fundamental
fact of the Science._

- M[superscript]r[/superscript] Fabroni after having pointed
out the chemical phaenomena

idea of Electricity being [deletion]at[/deletion]
[deletion]all[/deletion] [deletion]concerned[/deletion] [insertion]the cause[/insertion] of the
galvanic [deletion]expt[/deletion] [insertion]experiment[/insertion] - He supposed

that by knowledge man excelleth
man in that in which man
excelleth Beast, - that by learning
man ascendeth to the Heavens &
heir motions, when in Body
he cannot come, & the like, let
us consider the dignity & excellence
of knowledge in that to which
human Nature most aspires, which
is immortality or continuance | for
to this tends the raising of houses &
families, to this Buildings, foundations,
monuments, and the desires of
memory fame & celebration. But
the monuments of invention, &

& are perpetuated by letters

- In this eulogium, the illustrious
Author has alluded to knowledge
& invention in general; but it might
particularly be said of discoveries in experim
[deletion]Natural[/deletion]ental philosophy, that they cannot
but produce benefits & can by
no means be turned to evil or
unworthy purposes. -
Literature & the fine arts though
more noble in their general effects may
be misapplied - Natural Science on
the contrary, being an exhibition
of the powers existing in the

correct all evil tendencies & having

common observation; those which air
was incapable of changing &
which were permanent in
Nature & difficultly alterable
by art - Gradually accidental
discoveries led to the Knowledge
of others much more useful
but which were rare in Nature
& which industry aided by
invention produced from the
 rude ore. - But that
the soil under our feet;
the rocks & stones which
form the basis of the
earth should afford metallic
substances was an idea
which however sanctioned by
analogies, till within the
last three years very few
enlightened reasoners ventured
to lay any stress upon. -
