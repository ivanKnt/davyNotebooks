assemblage of the matters which
compose it if this assemblage
[deletion]either[/deletion] is changed either by
newly arranging the parts

The matter of light, in producing
sulphureous matters, introduces itself into the
substance of bodies, alters the arrangement
of their parts & increases them, & consequently
it changes the substance of the bodies
themselves in as many different ways as it
is possible to vary the situations & alter the
quantities, thus giving rise to infinite variety;
so that if we wished to compare the [insertion]diversity[/insertion] [deletion]variety[/deletion]
of bodies that exist, with that which might [deletion]be[/deletion]
arise from all the combinations possible, we
should be obliged to confess that the known Universe
is very contemptible in comparison with that which
might be formed, & also that if there were many worlds
similar to this we inhabit, they might all be adorned with
different objects without any change of matter or mode
of combination; a circumstance that marks the richness
& infinite power of the Being which created the universe -
