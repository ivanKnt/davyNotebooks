I have mentioned that Glauber
discovered the manner in which
Acids & alkalies as it were
neutralised each other. - [deletion]Nothing[/deletion] The
[deletion]manner in[/deletion] [insertion](theory by)[/insertion] which this phenomenon
was accounted for by the Philosophers
of the German & the French
School is very amusing -
They supposed that acids [deletion]from[/deletion] were
[deletion]their[/deletion] composed of little [insertion]points[/insertion] spiculae
or darts; - And that alkalies
were Bodies possessing pores capable
of receiving these points or spiculae;
- And they affirmed that when
a neutral salt was formed, the
spiculae, or the darts of the acid
became as it were locked
up in the pores of
the alkali "- It would
seem as if this Notion had
an influence upon common language
