In the early ages of cultivation;
very powerful motives were required

laborious & dangerous paths of
Experimental Research. -
To Minds influenced by
superstition & governed by credulity

- The early philosophers, had attempted
to combine in one view
all the objects of Science;
but in the plans instituted
by the new Institutions there
was a division of Labour;
- the efforts made were
more successful for they
were not vainly applied
to the whole of Nature; Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
were considered as of more

a principal object of research.

of Science as I shall hereafter
explain has furnished a

explanation.
[person]person_345|Homberg[/person] was a man of
genius & an indefatigable
experimenter; - We owe to
him a number of curious
observations upon metallic
precipitations & Chrystalizations:

- That exposure to the atmosphere
was essential to enable this
substance to kindle was clear
to [person]person_345|Homberg[/person]; & it is
therefore extraordinary that
he did not adopt the
beautiful [deletion]Hyp[/deletion] doctrine of
the British Schools; of
the dependence of combustion
upon Air; – his philosophy
of this process was [deletion]much[/deletion]
[deletion]more[/deletion] extremely vague & incorrect
though in the opinion of
his colleagues; it was
[deletion]system[/deletion] the most perfect
& sublime generalization
that had been advanced. -

[chemical]chemical_046|Phlogiston[/chemical] he gave the name
of [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical]; " - He conceived
that peculiar sulphurs were
always given off in inflammation:
and he attributed the increases
of weight of metals during
calcination not to their
combination with [chemical]chemical_022|[deletion]oxygene[/deletion][/chemical]
a part of the air; but
to a fixation of light
in them: -.  And he was
led to this false conclusion
by a series of experiments
made with a [underline]magnificent[/underline]
burning glass; constructed by
order of his patron
the [person]person_847|Duke of [underline]Orleans[/underline][/person];
[person]person_345|Homberg[/person]'s theoretical opinions; 
[deletion]though always false,[/deletion] being

of facts are always false; yet
the manner in which he brings
[deletion]defends them[/deletion]
them forward is often logical
& impressive: - " & his authoritative
style was much more calculated
to produce confidence in
the students of the Science
than the modest & hypothetical
views which [deletion]represented[/deletion] were brought
forward by our own Countrymen.
- I shall give a translation of
the end of his [otherwork]otherwork_219|essay[/otherwork] on flame
from the History of the Academy
for 1706 - It is a specimen
of his best manner of
treating chemical subjects. -
- He says Composition can
be infinitely varied - for the
substance of a compound
body consisting only of the

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10321-000-00018|dnp03b118pp|91026322[/page]
assemblage of the matters which
compose it if this assemblage
[deletion]either[/deletion] is changed either by
newly arranging the parts
or by varying the proportions
which may done almost
to infinity " it is evident
that the characters of the
body are susceptible of an
infinite variety of changes. -
The matter of light, in producing
sulphureous matters, introduces itself into the
substance of bodies, alters the arrangement
of their parts & increases them, & consequently
it changes the substance of the bodies
themselves in as many different ways as it
is possible to vary the situations & alter the
quantities, thus giving rise to infinite variety;
so that if we wished to compare the [insertion]diversity[/insertion] [deletion]variety[/deletion]
of bodies that exist, with that which might [deletion]be[/deletion]
arise from all the combinations possible, we
should be obliged to confess that the known Universe
is very contemptible in comparison with that which
might be formed, & also that if there were many worlds
similar to this we inhabit, they might all be adorned with
different objects without any change of matter or mode
of combination; a circumstance that marks the richness
& infinite power of the Being which created the universe -

I have mentioned that [person]person_639|Glauber[/person]
discovered the manner in which
Acids & alkalies as it were
neutralised each other. - [deletion]Nothing[/deletion] The
[deletion]manner in[/deletion] [insertion](theory by)[/insertion] which this phenomenon
was accounted for by the Philosophers
of the German & the French
School is very amusing -
They supposed that acids [deletion]from[/deletion] were
[deletion]their[/deletion] composed of little [insertion]points[/insertion] spiculae
or darts; - And that alkalies
were Bodies possessing pores capable
of receiving these points or spiculae;
- And they affirmed that when
a neutral salt was formed, the
spiculae, or the darts of the acid
became as it were locked
up in the pores of
the alkali "- It would
seem as if this Notion had
an influence upon common language

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10321-000-00020|dnp03b120pp|91026324[/page]
for [insertion]the words[/insertion] sharp & pungent in matters
of taste are often applied
to acids; - This mechanical
Doctrine was considered as
so just that several
of the earlier Observers with
the Microscope attempted to
discover these little points
in acid fluids; & there
were not wanting some who
carried their imagination so
far as to believe that
they had actually seen them.
- All the new arrangements
of Bodies were by the early French
Academicians, & the Disciples
[underline]of [person]person_388|Stahl[/person][/underline] conceived to depend
upon new mechanical
appositions of their parts:
- There was indeed a kind
of sentimental theory of Chemistry

advanced by some few of the
fast Disciples of the [misc]misc_410|Rosicrucian[/misc]
sect. Namely that there
was a particular affection
or love between the spiritual
essences which existed in
certain bodies; & which
disposed them to harmonize
and unite; but of course in
the rising age of exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
such a notion could meet
with no admirers; & the
desire of destroying occult causes
gave currency & importance
to the [underline]mechanical[/underline] solution.
- By a singular concurrence
of circumstances it was
reserved for the same Great
Genius who develloped the
Laws of the planetary system
& who unfurlded the Harmonious
movements of the great masses
of matter in the universe -

- In this instance there was [deletion]a[/deletion]
a species of retrograde step -
error followed the perception
of truth - but the ideas of
[person]person_021|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales[/person] were little pursued
& the glory of forming the true
immutable basis of the science
was reserved for [person]person_231|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black[/person]
of [place]place_284|Edinburgh[/place].
In 1755. [person]person_231|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black[/person] whilst

upon the alkalies [underline][chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical][/underline]
examined the [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical]
given out during the time of their

He soon ascertained that it
differed from the atmospherical
air in all it's properties. -
That it was heavier, acid to
the taste, nonrespirable & incapable
of supporting combustion; & He

- This fact apparently so simple
& obvious became the source of
the discovery of all the variety
of the gasses. - For the moment
it was ascertained that there
was one [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] fluid
differing from [chemical]chemical_254|common air[/chemical]
in it's essence, it became
easy to conceive that there
[underline]might exist[/underline] a number of others

Besides this discovery , [person]person_231|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black[/person]
developed the more general
one of [underline]latent Heat[/underline] or the
absorption of heat during the
conversion of solids into fluids
& of fluids into gasses - This

[person]person_231|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black[/person] committed very few
works to the press; & His principal
mode of making known his discoveries
was in public Lectures. The
school of [place]place_284|Edinburgh[/place] in consequence
soon became the most celebrated
in Europe. - Students flocked to it
from all quarters. & he communicated
to them [underline]instruction[/underline] that could
be procured in no other
way; & which was the more

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10321-000-00036|dnp03b136pp|91026340[/page]
valuable as at once sanctioned

I shall in the next lectures
in following the order which
I have laid down have occasion
to speak of & [deletion]to[/deletion] exhibit
some [insertion]chemical[/insertion] experiments of an illustrious
Countryman [insertion]of later date[/insertion] of still higher
importance; but I cannot
[deletion]th[/deletion] [deletion]in this place[/deletion] on this occasion
pass by the circumstance of
his recent loss without a
digression which may enable
me to offer a feeble tribute
of respect to the memory
of So great - a Man. -
- Of all the Philosophers of
the present age [person]person_026|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish[/person]
was the One who combined
in the highest degree
[deletion]a[/deletion] depth & extent of mathematical
knowledge

in the methods of
[deletion]R[/deletion] experimental Research. -
- It may be said of him,
what can perhaps hardly
be said of any other Person
that whatever He has done
has been perfect at the
moment of its production; -
|_ His processes were all of
a finished nature, |_ executed
by the hand of a Master
they required no correction;
- & though many of them
were performed in the
very infancy of Chemical
Philosophy yet their
accuracy & their beauty
have remained unimpaired

amidst the progress of
Discovery; & their merits
have been illustrated
by discussion & exalted
by time. -
-:- In general; the most
common motives which induce
Men to study are the
love of distinction of glory
or the desire of power; &
we have [deletion]perhap's[/deletion] no right
to object to motives of this
Kind; but it ought to be
mentioned in estimating [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion]
[deletion][person]person_026|Cavendishs[/person] Cha[/deletion] the Character of M[superscript]r[/superscript]
[person]person_026|Cavendish[/person] that his grand
stimulus to exertion was
evidently the love of truth
& of Knowledge: - unambitious
unassuming; it was often

[page]42|MS-DAVY-10321-000-00042|dnp03b142pp|91026346[/page]
with difficulty that He was
perswaded to bring forward
his important discoveries -
- He disliked notoriety ; He
[deletion]&[/deletion] was as it were fearful
of the voice of fame. - :
[deletion]The records of his labours are[/deletion]
[deletion]to be found only[/deletion]
His labours are recorded with
the greatest dignity & simplicity
& in the fewest possible words
without parade or apology.
& it seemed as if in
publication " He was performing
not what was a duty
to himself; but [insertion]what was[/insertion] a duty to
the public. -
-. His life was devoted to

of his friends principally
members of the Royal Society;
- He was reserved to strangers;
but where He was familiar
his conversation was lively
& full of varied information.
Upon all subjects of Science
He was luminous & profound.
& in discussion wonderfully
acute: -"
- Even to the very last week
of his life when He was
nearly 79 He retained [deletion][unclear]all[/unclear][/deletion]
his activity of Body &
all his energy & sagacity
of intellect. -. He was
warmly interested [deletion]to the[/deletion]
[deletion]very last[/deletion] in all new
subjects of Science; & several

times in the course of the

assisted in some experiments
that were carried on in
this Theatre. or in the

Since the death of [person]person_036|Newton[/person]
[insertion]if I might be permitted to give an opinion[/insertion] [place]place_121|England[/place] has sustained no
Scientific loss so great
as that of [person]person_026|Cavendish[/person].
[deletion]but[/deletion] like his great predecessor
He died full of years
& of [deletion]honours[/deletion] [insertion]glory[/insertion]; - His name
will be an object of
more veneration in future
ages than in the present
moment; - though it
was unknown in the
busy scenes of life or

He made up for the defect of his
manipulations by the rapidity of
execution & the novelty of his
methods. -
- He prepared the way for more
accomplished Chemists - He furnished
them with matter for enquiry &
in the true spirit of liberality
offered to the world all his
treasures of Science - He was
as the [underline]miner[/underline] who discovers
hidden riches & furnishes them
in their unwrought state to
the Cunning Artist - The ore that
he brought to light was
crude; but it was precious
& useful. - To Theory D[superscript]r[/superscript].

with an ardour almost puerile -

principally narrations of facts,

easy therefore to find a
reason for the occasional
