Introductory
Dublin Course

To find myself surrounded by
such an audience is in
the highest degree flattering
& encouraging.
I [deletion]feel feel most sincerely grateful[/deletion] [insertion]offer you my most sincere[/insertion]
[insertion]thanks[/insertion] for the honour you are pleased
to [underline]confer on me[/underline] by supposing
that I have any thing to
bring forward worthy of your
attention & capable of exciting
your interest. - & [deletion]I am[/deletion] I shall
[insertion]use my best exertions[/insertion] [deletion]proud on this occasion;[/deletion]
[deletion]& from such a circumstance[/deletion]
[deletion]I cannot but augur favorably[/deletion]
[deletion]concerning the [insertion]future[/insertion] cultivation[/deletion]
[deletion]& progress of this [deletion]principle[/deletion] novel[/deletion]
[deletion]branch of Science [deletion]of[/deletion] in this[/deletion]
[deletion]Country [deletion]of activity & genius[/deletion] so distinguished [deletion]in[/deletion] for talent[/deletion]
[deletion]& Genius.-[/deletion]

- And I shall use my best exertions
to prove to you, that this
mark of your favour, [deletion]even[/deletion] however
if it [deletion]h[/deletion]may [insertion]have[/insertion] been [deletion][insertion]bestowed[/insertion][/deletion] unworthily bestowed
[deletion]bestowed[/deletion] [insertion]at least[/insertion] has not been [deletion]received[/deletion]
ungratefully received.-
In endeavoring to demonstrate
the facts & principles of
Electrochemical Science - |_ I
shall follow [deletion]an[/deletion] a [deletion]order[/deletion] method
in which the elementary
& simple truths [deletion]of the[/deletion]
[deletion]Science[/deletion] will be blended as
much as possible with practical
& popular illustrations |_; & the
whole elucidated [deletion]as much[/deletion]
[deletion]as is possible[/deletion] by experiments.
[deletion]- I cannot but feel [deletion]that[/deletion] however[/deletion]
[deletion]a part of my audience[/deletion]

-: In the period which is necessarily
allotted [underline]to these lectures[/underline]; |_ it will
be impossible for me to [deletion]offer[/deletion] afford
upon many of the subjects any
other than general views; & I
cannot but omit such demonstrations
as properly belong to [insertion]a general[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]chemical[/insertion] course
[deletion]of [insertion]general[/insertion] Chemistry[/deletion]. -. |_ I must consider
these as already discussed by
my able & learned friend
the professor of Chemistry ; |_ What
I have to offer I offer merely
as a sequel to his [deletion]course[/deletion] lectures
|_ If there are any present who
are as yet [underline]uninitiated[/underline] in
the common language of Chemistry;
& who should find me obscure
or unintelligible, I fear I can
[underline]offer them[/underline], no other apology,
& I feel that [underline]dependence[/underline]
upon their [underline]candour[/underline] , which
induces me to believe that they

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10330-000-00004|dnp03b1004pp|91026864[/page]
will require no other.-
- |_ On this occasion I trust
I have little cause for -
a more detailed appeal |_ but
there is a part of my audience
to whom it is necessary
to make an appeal of
a totally different kind.,
|_ I allude to those scientific
Men who are Masters &
not Scholars.- [deletion]These[/deletion] Those
proficient in Science to
whom the elementary truths
are but as the alphabet
of a language with which they
are perfectly familiar. - & I
trust they will pardon me
if I enter upon [deletion]details[/deletion] [insertion]matters[/insertion] with
which they are intimately acquainted.
- The [deletion]few[/deletion] few novelties in Science
which it will be in my
power to offer them, I can
hardly [insertion]be vain enough to[/insertion] consider as a sufficient
motive for their presence; & I [deletion]must[/deletion] [insertion]hope[/insertion]

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10330-000-00005|dnp03b1005pp|91026865[/page]

[insertion]I may venture to[/insertion] regard [deletion]it[/deletion] [deletion]their presence[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] as a proof
of their favorable disposition towards
the labour I have undertaken .
