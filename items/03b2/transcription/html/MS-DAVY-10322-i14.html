         <p>French chemist and tax farmer (for which he was guillotined). Developed a new nomenclature
            for chemistry (much of which is still in use today) and argued strongly against the
            existence of phlogiston. Davy read some of his writings while in Cornwall which he
            then opposed and throughout his career maintained an ambivalent attitude towards Lavoisierian
            chemisty. ForMemRSL.</p>
