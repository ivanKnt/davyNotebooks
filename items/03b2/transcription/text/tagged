I concluded the last lecture
by some account of the
Philosophical character of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
[person]person_016|Priestley[/person], - /_ I know no book
so likely to lead a student
into the path of a Discovery
as [otherwork]otherwork_055|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestleys six Volumes[/otherwork]
upon Air. His
most important experiments were
made with apparatus of the
most simple kind. - The grandest
& most expensive
instrument like that of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
[person]person_021|Hales[/person] was a gun barrel.
He used phials & bent glass
tubes for [misc]misc_317|retorts[/misc], a wash hand
basin often served him for
a pneumatic trough; & instead of

porcelain tubes He employed
tobacco pipes & with this
simple machinery He discovered
a greater number of [deletion]fac[/deletion]
new [deletion]su[/deletion] substances than any
philosopher of the last century. -
- [person]person_021|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales[/person] has [deletion]stated[/deletion] mentioned in

[deletion]I[/deletion] during the solution of [deletion]Wal[/deletion]
a mineral which He calls
[chemical]chemical_450|Walton Pyrites[/chemical] - & which
must have been in common
iron [chemical]chemical_032|pyrites[/chemical], He procured
air which when mixed with
[chemical]chemical_254|common air[/chemical] gave a turbid

that He wished much to

- I have mentioned Scheele as
an admirable experimenter; as in
the last lecture I endeavored to
do justice to the philosophical
[deletion]characters[/deletion] labours of [person]person_026|Cavendish[/person] & [person]person_016|Priesley[/person],
- I shall with the same kind of
feeling refer to [insertion]the exalted character of[/insertion] the only
foreign [insertion]Philosopher[/insertion] of the last century;
whose merits as a Discoverer
can be at all put in
competition with those of our
Countrymen. -
Scheele offers an [deletion]no[/deletion] extraordinary
instance of the powers of
Genius to conquer difficulties & to
create resources of its own; -
|_ Born in a country Town in
[place]place_246|Sweden[/place] without friends &
without fortune" He seemed
by a disposition which may be

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00008|dnp03b208pp|91026874[/page]
called almost intuitive to
have pursued the [deletion]Chem[/deletion] study
of Chemistry. - |_ He was

& Druggist & led by the
circumstances of his business
to [deletion]pursue[/deletion] attend to some
of the chemical qualities
of [deletion]medi[/deletion] substances employed in
pharmacy; - He instituted
a train of investigations
which gradually led to
discoveries of the noblest
Kind. - Scheele amidst
the labours of an unprofitable
occupation found means
of exalting & extending the
most refined parts of Chemistry.
|_ His days were devoted to a
[insertion]laborious[/insertion] business - [deletion]And He[/deletion] His nights

He performed the most delicate

was ignorant of the [deletion]importance[/deletion] [insertion]honour [deletion]glory[/deletion] which[/insertion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]would result from[/insertion] his [deletion]labours[/deletion] discoveries - Neither
seeking fame nor profit. He
[underline]pursued Science[/underline]; because His spirit
[deletion]pass[/deletion] [deletion]mind[/deletion] was imbued with an
unquenchable desire for truth
[deletion]& Knowledge[/deletion]: - Nothing could
repress the ardour of his Mind
nor damp the fire of his genius, -
& His short life was a career of

- [person]person_224|Scheele [/person][deletion]disc[/deletion] made known
at least 13 new bodies;
& his Chemistry may be called
[deletion]a[/deletion] almost his own creation. -
- His theories were formed
with boldness; but He attached
no importance [underline]to; them[/underline] except
as the mere links for the
connection of facts: - [deletion]And[/deletion]
[deletion]like his countryman[/deletion]: He was
a faithful disciple of the
school of [person]person_124|Bacon[/person] & of [person]person_036|Newton[/person]
-: At the time that Scheele
began his chemical labours [insertion]about 1772[/insertion]
[person]person_033|Bergman[/person] [deletion]of Us s[/deletion] professor
of Chemistry of [place]place_283|Upsal[/place] was
the great scientific luminary
[underline]of [place]place_246|Sweden[/place][/underline]: - |_ He had
[deletion]made[/deletion] distinguished himself
by some very profound
investigations concerning [insertion]chemical[/insertion] attraction

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00011|dnp03b211pp|91026877[/page]
33
& had ascertained some important
facts respecting metallic bodies
& neutral salts: - The Manner
in which [person]person_033|Bergman[/person] brought
forward Scheele is highly
honorable to the scientific
Character of the country.
- He wrote a preface for his
first work; [deletion]became[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] his friend
& his protector; [deletion][unclear]Coming[/unclear][/deletion]
X relinquishing the venerable authority
of his chair, He became
the disciple of a young man
as yet unknown to the world.
- It has been said of [person]person_033|Bergman[/person]
that his greatest discovery was
the discovery of Scheele. It
may be perhaps likewise said
that his greatest glory was the
glory of raising & exalting merit
even though it was in acknowledging
his own inferiority. Such examples
are very rare, - there are few

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00012|dnp03b212pp|91026878[/page]
instances of such sacrifices of
the selfish feelings; - & that
they should be faithfully
recorded is [insertion]necessary[/insertion] for the honour of
Human nature - "& for demonstrating
to use the language of [person]person_124|Bacon[/person]
that Wisdom is justified by
her Children.

- [person]person_016|Priestley[/person] & Scheele from using
material which absorbed a portion
of the [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical] of the Atmosphere
over rated the quantity of
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], [deletion]but it contained[/deletion]. [person]person_026|M[superscript]r[/superscript][line]Cavendish[/person] with his usual
sagacity & unparalleled precision
shewed that it contained rather
more than 1/5 of its volume; ie
accurately 21 parts [deletion]out[/deletion] in 100;
- And He proved that at
different times of the year
with different winds & in
the country & town there was
precisely the same relation between
its constituent parts.
- Though [otherwork]otherwork_011|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish's paper[/otherwork]
ought to have established this
as a truth yet doctrines which
seemed on superficial view

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00014|dnp03b214pp|91026880[/page]
much more plausible namely
that there were very great
varieties in the constitution
of the atmosphere were
very generally received; thus
it was said by [person]person_348|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Ingenhouz[/person]
that the sea air was much
more pure than that of
the land; that the air
of the country contained
much more [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] than
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]air[/insertion] of Towns; & the
[deletion]salu[/deletion] relative salubrity of different
situations was [deletion]referred[/deletion] judged
of by the quantity of
diminution given by [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous[line]gas[/chemical]. -

advanced the idea that the

of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]; & his process
had such an air of precision

in so factive a manner
that "his ideas were adopted

[underline]I have been a suspicious[/underline]

I have referred to some
of the early opinions concerning

the discussion of [person]person_016|Priestley[/person] of
[person]person_026|Cavendish[/person] and of Scheele threw
a [underline]new light[/underline]upon their most
most important practice of
[underline]animal life.[/underline]
- [person]person_016|Priestley[/person] once ascertained
that [deletion]pure[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] disappeared
in respiration & that a

that as in combustion" the
[underline]heat[/underline]was liberated during the
formation of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline][chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical].[/underline]
That this heat was consumed
in the process of living

end of respiration was to

matter.

It is evident then that in

of a matter noxious to
animal life.
It soon was a question
of high philosophical
importance by what resources
of nature the equilibrium
of the Atmosphere was preserved.
in what manner [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] was
reproduced and [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
destroyed; some gloomy
philosophers supposed that
our atmosphere must necessarily
be in a state of deterioration,
but a simple series of
experiments proved that
the means of renovation
were as certain &
as constant as those of
decay.
