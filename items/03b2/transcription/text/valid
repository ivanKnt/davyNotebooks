I concluded the last lecture
by some account of the
Philosophical character of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Priestley, - /_ I know no book
so likely to lead a student
into the path of a Discovery
as D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestleys six Volumes
upon Air. His
most important experiments were
made with apparatus of the
most simple kind. - The grandest
& most expensive
instrument like that of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Hales was a gun barrel.
He used phials & bent glass
tubes for retorts, a wash hand
basin often served him for
a pneumatic trough; & instead of

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00002|dnp03b202pp|91026868[/page]
porcelain tubes He employed
tobacco pipes & with this
simple machinery He discovered
a greater number of [deletion]fac[/deletion]
new [deletion]su[/deletion] substances than any
philosopher of the last century. -
- D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales has [deletion]stated[/deletion] mentioned in
his statical essays that [deletion]He[/deletion]
[deletion]I[/deletion] during the solution of [deletion]Wal[/deletion]
a mineral which He calls
Walton Pyrites - & which
must have been in common
iron pyrites, He procured
air which when mixed with
common air gave a turbid
red fume. - D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley
on mentioning to M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish
that He wished much to
witness this phaenomenon
but that He despaired of
ever procuring walton pyrites
was advised by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish

to try any pyrites or metallic
[underline]substance[/underline], for He had no doubt
that the properties of the
air depended upon the spirit
of Nitre, the Nitrous acid &
not [deletion]of[/deletion] upon the substance
dissolved. -

knowledge of the properties
of a new elastic fluid - D[superscript]r[/superscript]

- I have mentioned Scheele as
an admirable experimenter; as in
the last lecture I endeavored to
do justice to the philosophical
[deletion]characters[/deletion] labours of Cavendish & Priesley,
- I shall with the same kind of
feeling refer to [insertion]the exalted character of[/insertion] the only
foreign [insertion]Philosopher[/insertion] of the last century;
whose merits as a Discoverer
can be at all put in
competition with those of our
Countrymen. -
Scheele offers an [deletion]no[/deletion] extraordinary
instance of the powers of
Genius to conquer difficulties & to
create resources of its own; -
|_ Born in a country Town in
Sweden without friends &
without fortune" He seemed
by a disposition which may be

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00008|dnp03b208pp|91026874[/page]
called almost intuitive to
have pursued the [deletion]Chem[/deletion] study
of Chemistry. - |_ He was
[underline]brought[/underline] up as an Apothecary
& Druggist & led by the
circumstances of his business
to [deletion]pursue[/deletion] attend to some
of the chemical qualities
of [deletion]medi[/deletion] substances employed in
pharmacy; - He instituted
a train of investigations
which gradually led to
discoveries of the noblest
Kind. - Scheele amidst
the labours of an unprofitable
occupation found means
of exalting & extending the
most refined parts of Chemistry.
|_ His days were devoted to a
[insertion]laborious[/insertion] business - [deletion]And He[/deletion] His nights

He performed the most delicate

acquainted with Bergman He
was ignorant of the [deletion]importance[/deletion] [insertion]honour [deletion]glory[/deletion] which[/insertion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]would result from[/insertion] his [deletion]labours[/deletion] discoveries - Neither
seeking fame nor profit. He
[underline]pursued Science[/underline]; because His spirit

unquenchable desire for truth
[deletion]& Knowledge[/deletion]: - Nothing could
repress the ardour of his Mind
nor damp the fire of his genius, -
& His short life was a career of
enterprise; & of glory. - [deletion]As[/deletion]
[deletion]a Discoverer He was not inferior[/deletion]
[deletion]to Priestley; & He was a[/deletion]
[deletion]much more accomplished Chemist;[/deletion]

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00010|dnp03b210pp|91026876[/page]
- Scheele [deletion]disc[/deletion] made known
at least 13 new bodies;
& his Chemistry may be called
[deletion]a[/deletion] almost his own creation. -
- His theories were formed
with boldness; but He attached
no importance [underline]to; them[/underline] except
as the mere links for the
connection of facts: - [deletion]And[/deletion]
[deletion]like his countryman[/deletion]: He was
a faithful disciple of the
school of [person]person_124|Bacon[/person] & of Newton
-: At the time that Scheele
began his chemical labours [insertion]about 1772[/insertion]
Bergman [deletion]of Us s[/deletion] professor
of Chemistry of Upsal was
the great scientific luminary
[underline]of Sweden[/underline]: - |_ He had
[deletion]made[/deletion] distinguished himself
by some very profound
investigations concerning [insertion]chemical[/insertion] attraction

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00011|dnp03b211pp|91026877[/page]
33
& had ascertained some important
facts respecting metallic bodies
& neutral salts: - The Manner
in which Bergman brought
forward Scheele is highly
honorable to the scientific
Character of the country.
- He wrote a preface for his
first work; [deletion]became[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] his friend
& his protector; [deletion][unclear]Coming[/unclear][/deletion]
X relinquishing the venerable authority
of his chair, He became
the disciple of a young man
as yet unknown to the world.
- It has been said of Bergman
that his greatest discovery was
the discovery of Scheele. It
may be perhaps likewise said
that his greatest glory was the
glory of raising & exalting merit
even though it was in acknowledging
his own inferiority. Such examples
are very rare, - there are few

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00012|dnp03b212pp|91026878[/page]
instances of such sacrifices of
the selfish feelings; - & that

Human nature - "& for demonstrating

- Priestley & Scheele from using
material which absorbed a portion
of the Nitrogene of the Atmosphere
over rated the quantity of
oxygene, [deletion]but it contained[/deletion]. M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Cavendish with his usual
sagacity & unparalleled precision
shewed that it contained rather
more than 1/5 of its volume; ie
accurately 21 parts [deletion]out[/deletion] in 100;
- And He proved that at
different times of the year
with different winds & in
the country & town there was
precisely the same relation between
its constituent parts.
- Though M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish's paper
ought to have established this
as a truth yet doctrines which
seemed on superficial view

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00014|dnp03b214pp|91026880[/page]
much more plausible namely
that there were very great
varieties in the constitution
of the atmosphere were
very generally received; thus
it was said by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Ingenhouz
that the sea air was much
more pure than that of
the land; that the air
of the country contained
much more oxygene than
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]air[/insertion] of Towns; & the
[deletion]salu[/deletion] relative salubrity of different
situations was [deletion]referred[/deletion] judged
of by the quantity of

had such an air of precision

I have referred to some
of the early opinions concerning

of Slare & Hawsksbee. - The
the discussion of Priestley of
Cavendish and of Scheele threw
a [underline]new light[/underline]upon their most
most important practice of
[underline]animal life.[/underline]
- Priestley once ascertained
that [deletion]pure[/deletion] oxygene disappeared
in respiration & that a
quantity of Carbonic acid
nearly equal to it was

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00017|dnp03b217pp|91026883[/page]

formed" & D[superscript]r[/superscript] Crawford concluded
that as in combustion" the
[underline]heat[/underline]was liberated during the
formation of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]Carbonic acid.[/underline]
That this heat was consumed
in the process of living
action & that the great
end of respiration was to
give heat to the blood
and free it from inflammable
matter.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[underline]Breathing in a gas holder[/underline]
[underline]examining the gas.[/underline]
[underline]Zinc water[/underline]
It is evident then that in
the process of respiration there
is a continued consumption
of oxygene and the production

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10322-000-00018|dnp03b218pp|91026884[/page]
of a matter noxious to
animal life.
It soon was a question
of high philosophical
importance by what resources
of nature the equilibrium
of the Atmosphere was preserved.
in what manner oxygene was
reproduced and carbonic acid
destroyed; some gloomy
philosophers supposed that
our atmosphere must necessarily
be in a state of deterioration,
but a simple series of
experiments proved that
the means of renovation
were as certain &
as constant as those of
decay.
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priesley discovered
[underline]that plants[/underline]
