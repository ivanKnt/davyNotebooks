I spoke in the last lecture of
various phaenomena of [underline]Atmospheric[/underline]
[underline]Electricity[/underline]; in which the
Electricity may be regarded as

by the common Electrical machine;
I shall now speak of some
Electrical effects produced by
arrangements in which the state
is similar to that of
the Electricity belonging to the
Voltaic Battery. & these
arrangements [deletion]belong[/deletion] [insertion]are attached[/insertion] to animated
Beings. -

ancients that a fish of
the [underline]Ray Kind[/underline], The Torpedo which
was called by the Greeks, Narke
had the power of giving shocks
