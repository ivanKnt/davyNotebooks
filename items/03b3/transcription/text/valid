[deletion][unclear]1810[/unclear][/deletion]
In the last lecture I endeavored
to explain the circumstances
of Electrical excitation -.
It was shewn that [underline]different[/underline]
bodies become electrical by
[deletion][unclear]mere[/unclear][/deletion]contact; - [insertion]& friction[/insertion]. - [deletion]And that in[/deletion]
[deletion]the, [underline]same body[/underline] Electricity is[/deletion]
[deletion]produced by changes of temperature[/deletion]
[deletion]or changes of [underline]form[/underline][/deletion]: & it
was stated that in all cases
in which one part of a body
or a system of bodies is [deletion]positive[/deletion] in
[deletion][unclear]as the part is one[/unclear][/deletion] the state called positive. Another
[deletion]body[/deletion]-. . is negative.-
-. It was likewise shewn that

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00004|dnp03b302pp|75689407[/page]
an [underline]electrified[/underline] body is capable
of producing electricity in
another body without [underline]contact[/underline]-,
- And this was called Electricity
by induction - " And it was
shewn . that in the case of
induced electricity. - That surface
of the body [insertion]not originally electrical[/insertion] which is opposite
to that surface of the electrified
Body which is positive becomes
negative - & vice versa - And
it was shewn that the
accumulation of Electricity
in different instruments;
& its discharge are dependent
upon the circumstances &
laws of this [underline]inductive influence[/underline]
[underline]or power[/underline]. -
- [deletion]In this lecture I shall[/deletion]

pursue the enquiry of the
principle of the operation, of
Electricity [underline]in our more refined[/underline]
[underline]artificial[/underline], combinations; &
in some of the electrical
arrangements existing in
nature.- [insertion](which [underline]have not yet been considered[/underline][/insertion] [deletion]For the elucidation[/deletion]
[deletion]of the subject I shall attempt[/deletion]
[deletion]some [unclear]formes[/unclear] of experiment[/deletion]
[deletion]which have not been before[/deletion]
[deletion]tried. And this lecture[/deletion]
[deletion]in some parts will be[/deletion]
[deletion]a lecture of investigation.[/deletion] ([underline]As[/underline]
[deletion]an instrument of a very[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]powerful kind[/underline] & which has[/deletion]
[deletion]been rarely used will be[/deletion]
[deletion]brought into activity; new[/deletion]
[deletion]results may fairly be anticipated[/deletion] [unclear]o[/unclear]

[deletion]brilliant results; : & if our[/deletion]
[deletion]operations should be more[/deletion]
[deletion]slow & more imperfect[/deletion]
[deletion]than usual; - You I[/deletion]
[deletion]trust will find an apology[/deletion]
[deletion]in the desire which I have[/deletion]
[deletion]to make you partakers in[/deletion]
[deletion]the acquisition of new facts.[/deletion]
[deletion][superscript][unclear]xx[/unclear][/superscript][/deletion] I stated towards the conclusion
of the last lecture, that the
powers of the Voltaic apparatus,
may be referred to the [deletion][unclear]argument[/unclear][/deletion]
[underline]electricity originally[/underline] produced
[underline]by contact[/underline], [underline]between the[/underline] zinc
& copper & to the increase
of this electricity by
induction.-
The idea may be illustrated

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00007|dnp03b305pp|75689410[/page]

by conceiving a number of
cylinders opposed to each other
[underline]in the atmosphere[/underline] & [deletion]which have[/deletion] [insertion]each furnished [underline]with[/underline][/insertion]
an apparatus for [deletion]rendering each[/deletion] [insertion]primary[/insertion]
[deletion]primarily active[/deletion][insertion]excitation[/insertion]; - It is evident
that the powers of the whole
[deletion]may[/deletion] must be increased by the
principle of [underline]induction[/underline]. -
[underline]Ritters battery[/underline]
[underline]Instance[/underline]. -
This would extend to any so shewn o o o o o o
by the [underline]luminous royal Institution. .[/underline]
- But it may be asked if
such is the law of the accumulation
of Electricity in the Voltaic
combination; why does not
an arrangement act in the
[underline]air[/underline], why is water or a
fluid body essential to the
effect.-

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00008|dnp03b306pp|75689411[/page]
To be able to understand
this we must examine
the general circumstances
[underline]of the accumulation of[/underline] Electricity
[underline]in relation to what is[/underline]
[underline]called by Electricians[/underline] [underline]quantity[/underline]
& Intensity .-.
- You have observed that, in
the phaenomena presented by
the common electrical machine -
the spark passes to different
distances in different cases;
- And the case is the same
in the discharge of [underline]Jars[/underline].-;
- The space through which
a spark passes is said to
denote the [underline]intensity[/underline] of the
Electricity; & this intensity is

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00009|dnp03b307pp|75689412[/page]
46a
said to be [underline]greater[/underline] [underline]or[/underline] less, in
proportion as the spark passes
through a larger or a smaller
[underline]space[/underline] of air. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]. -
[deletion][underline]Lanes quadrant[/underline] Electrometer[/deletion]
- Now if a jar be charged;
[deletion]& brought into contact with[/deletion]
so as to give a spark of
[deletion]9.[/deletion] half an inch [deletion]or so as to[/deletion]
[deletion]repel an [underline]electrometer[/underline] to 25[/deletion]
[deletion]degrees[/deletion]; & then be connected
both by its positive & negative
surfaces with another [deletion]equal[/deletion] jar
jar; .- It is evident that
the quantity of electrical
power must remain the
[underline]same[/underline]; though it is distributed
[underline]over more space[/underline]. but the
spark from [underline]the two jars[/underline] will
46a

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00010|dnp03b308pp|75689413[/page]
only pass through a quarter of
[underline]an inch[/underline] - In this case the
intensity of the Electricity can
be said to be only half as
great. -
- If a Battery of twenty jars
were [underline]to be used[/underline]; the spark
would pass through scarcely
a perceptible [underline]space[/underline] of [underline]air[/underline]:
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- And [deletion]when[/deletion] if a hundred jars
be employed actual contact
would be required, so that
no spark would be visible
but the shock would
still [underline]be sensible[/underline] - It would
however be very different
from the shock given by
the [underline]single jar[/underline]; The single jar

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00011|dnp03b309pp|75689414[/page]
47
would give a painful & violent
impression felt principally in
the elbows & wrists. - The
Battery [underline]containing[/underline] the same
quantity of electricity will
give - a [deletion]most[/deletion] grating sensation
in [unclear]jaw[/unclear] & a feeling of [underline]heat[/underline]
principally about the chest &
shoulders. -
- The same quantity of [underline]Electricity[/underline]..
whatever be the surface on
which it acts appears as far
as our exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] have yet gone to
be discharged immediately by
[underline]perfect conductors[/underline]; - ie whether
a jar; is discharged alone
or connected with a battery.
- There is no perceptible time
when a metallic wire is

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00012|dnp03b310pp|75689415[/page]
used; but if imperfect
[underline]conductors be employed[/underline]; more
[underline]time[/underline] is required to discharge
[deletion]the[/deletion] electricities of low than
of [underline]high intensity[/underline];
[underline]for[/underline] . [underline]Instance[/underline]
[short horizontal rule]
[underline]Ether[/underline] - [underline]Jar. Battery[/underline]
[underline]still less[/underline] rapidly - large Battery.-
Water will discharge this
less [deletion]slow[/deletion] rapidly. - so that
at a [underline]very low[/underline] intensity
indeed . ie suppose 1000
jars which will not give
[underline]a spark[/underline]; -. [insertion]moderately[/insertion] imperfect conductors
will be as [underline]much insulating[/underline]

[underline]Electricity[/underline] of a high intensity
- But if [deletion]water[/deletion] imperfect conductors
be [underline]insulating bodies[/underline] to any
[underline]Electricity[/underline], they will act as
a [underline]medium[/underline] of [underline]induction[/underline];
& an accumulation & discharge
will take place through, them
& [underline]fluids[/underline] in consequence will be conducting
[insertion]in relation[/insertion] to the [underline]low intensity[/underline] of the
Metals in the Voltaic apparatus
[underline]what[/underline] [underline]gasses or airs[/underline] are to
the higher electricity of the
[underline]common Machine[/underline] & the leyden
jar. - { that Electricity in a low state
{ of Intensity will act by induction in
[insertion][deletion]- That the [underline]Electricity[/underline] of the[/deletion] [/insertion] fluids is shewn by many experiments
on a wire in water.

- In the [underline]Voltaic apparatus[/underline]
the Electricity is of low intensity

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00014|dnp03b312pp|75689417[/page]
but in [unclear]immense[/unclear] quantities;
In thee charge of the
[underline]common jar[/underline]; it is
small quantity but of high
[underline]intensity[/underline]. -- In the
one case it is a large
quantity diffused over an
immense surface. In the
other case - It is a small
quantity diffused over a very
[underline]small surface[/underline]. - -
- If these consideratons be
kept in view; the Theory
of the Voltaic pile / which
all elucidations
that can be given is still
a difficult subject; the Theory

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00015|dnp03b313pp|75689418[/page]

of the Voltaic combination will
be found to harmonize with
the other facts of Electricity

[deletion]- The quan[/deletion]
- And the Intensity of the
Electricity increases with the
number [underline]of the series[/underline]; so that
500 series will give a spark
capable of passing [underline]through air[/underline];
- It will [unclear]however[/unclear] differ from
the common electrical spark
in this that as a much
greater [underline]quantity[/underline] of positive
& negative power come into
equilibrium so its effects
will be infinitely stronger;
& its power of ignition

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00016|dnp03b314pp|75689419[/page]
infinitely greater . . . -

It will pass through fluids with great

It will likewise pass through
a greater distance in rare

nearly to the same
[underline]distance[/underline]; as the common

So that by increasing
the number of alternations
in a Battery - Voltaic Electricity
is made analogous to
[underline]common Electricity[/underline] [insertion]when in its highest state as to quantity[/insertion] & [insertion]reciprocally[/insertion] By
diffusing a considerable quantity

- The [underline]Identity[/underline] of the nature
of the agent concerned in
[underline]the operations[/underline] of Common
& Voltaic Electricity if any
further proofs be wanting
is shewn; by [insertion]applying[/insertion] [deletion]applying[/deletion]
the Electricity of the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]Batter[/deletion] Voltaic combination
to the common Battery.-
- In this case a charge
{

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00018|dnp03b316pp|75689421[/page]
is [underline]communicated[/underline]; which
has all the characters
of a common electrical
charge of [underline]low Intensity[/underline]. -
- I just now stated that
the Intensity of the Electricity
of the Voltaic apparatus
increases with the number
of the combinations -
[underline]Instance[/underline]; -
It may with propriety be
asked does the quantity increase
in a similar ratio. - It
certainly increases with the
[underline]number[/underline] - for a large number
of plates will fuse a
larger quantity of wire

than a small number all
other circumstances [underline]being similar[/underline];
& as metals are perfect
[underline]conductors[/underline]; we have no right
to ascribe the [insertion]greater[/insertion] power of fusion
to a higher intensity.
- There [insertion]are however other important[/insertion][deletion]is another[/deletion] important
circumstances on which the
[underline]quantity[/underline] of Electricity in voltaic
combinations depends.

Not immediately connected

[underline]No atmosphere[/underline], [underline]perfect insulation[/underline]

Strongest one that I am

a [deletion]fluid[/deletion] peculiar [underline]subtile fluid[/underline];
which cannot appear unless

[underline]composed[/underline] of the [underline]two[/underline] electricities
ie let these be regarded as
different subtile fluids; [underline]but[/underline]
in [underline]this case[/underline]. Cold ought
to be produced in some
part of the system - I once had
[underline]this idea[/underline] . It satisfies the
imagination; but . - not
[underline]the reason[/underline]. - If we suppose
[underline]one fluid[/underline]; & this fluid
carries heat with it
whence can its heat be

it to be heat or light

passes one way & the other

I spoke in the last lecture of
various phaenomena of [underline]Atmospheric[/underline]
[underline]Electricity[/underline]; in which the
Electricity may be regarded as
in that [underline]state of Intensity[/underline] which
is analagous to the[deletion]at[/deletion] state exhibited
by the common Electrical machine;
I shall now speak of some
Electrical effects produced by
arrangements in which the state
is similar to that of
the Electricity belonging to the
Voltaic Battery. & these
arrangements [deletion]belong[/deletion] [insertion]are attached[/insertion] to animated
Beings. -
- It was known to the
ancients that a fish of
the [underline]Ray Kind[/underline], The Torpedo which
was called by the Greeks, Narke
had the power of giving shocks

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00030|dnp03b328pp|75689433[/page]
or of producing numbness in
the hands of the Fishermen
who touched it. -
Reaumer supposed the power
to depend upon a particular
vibratory effect of the muscles
of the Fish

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10323-000-00032|dnp03b330pp|75689435[/page]
Medical Science will arise from
the pursuit of this enquiry
There is great reason to
believe; - I trust it
