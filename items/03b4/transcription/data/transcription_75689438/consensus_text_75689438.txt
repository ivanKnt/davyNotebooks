In the last lecture - My principal
object was to shew that "
the powers of the Voltaic apparatus
& of the common Electrical machine
depend upon the same agent.=.
- And [insertion]to prove that[/insertion] the difference between them
[underline]depends[/underline] upon [insertion]the difference in[/insertion] the intensity &
quantity of the electricity; /_&
the relations between this Intensity
& quantity were defined..
It was shewn that [underline]the[/underline]electricity
of the common Machine [deletion]could[/deletion] can
be made similar to that
of the Voltaic instrument by
[underline]being diffused[/underline] over [underline]a large surface[/underline];
- its quantity being increased whilst
