In a sketch of this nature & in the
time allotted for it, I shall not be expected
to produce a minute History of all the
various insulated experiments that have
been made. /_ My endeavour will be
rather to fix your attention upon the
leading & grand discoveries which form
the epochs of the Science. /_The brilliancy
of Electrical phenomena, & the facility of
producing them led [underline]an immense[/underline] number
of [underline]enquirers into[/underline] this field of research. -
/_ Many have developed new objects in it
but a very few only have ascertained
principles. And in philosophical annals
the fame of subordinate improvers
is necessarily absorbed in that of the
noble inventors, as in military
details the worth of the common
soldier & of the subaltern is as it
were swallowed up in the glory of
the Generals.-
