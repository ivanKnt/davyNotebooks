as I mentioned in the introductory Lecture
must be referred to the time of
[person_383 ]Gilbert[/person_383] & his views are developed
in the treatise "De Magnete" published
in 1600: - /_The Ancients were
acquainted with two electrical
bodies only, Amber, & Lyncurium
(which is either the topaz or tourmaline).
[person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] ascertained that a great
variety of bodies were capable of
being excited, & that the electricity
of bodies was impaired by moist
air & aqueous fluids; but not
by oily & resinous substances: -
his work is worthy of being studied;
& I am surprized that an English
edition of it has never been published. -
[person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] was a man above his age
& [insertion]in his time[/insertion] his philosophy was little attended
to; & one reason why it was
neglected in later [deletion]times[/deletion] [insertion]periods[/insertion] is the
singular reproach thrown upon it
