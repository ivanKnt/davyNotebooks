Sciences was occasionally [underline]misled[/underline] by
his zeal for the destruction of
[underline]prejudices[/underline], & of false opinions;
& by his contempt for the absurdities
of the ancient Schools. - Anxious
to build up his own great edifice[deletion]s[/deletion]
with his own materials & by his
own strength, he refused all
assistance; & the founder of a
new & grand Philosophy, - he
scorned to blend either the [underline]facts[/underline]
or opinions of [underline]others[/underline], with what
he conceived to be peculiarly his
own work. - Confident of greatness,
& looking with a stedfast eye
towards the creations of his own
noble genius, - he did not fully
see the merit of others - as in
the meridian light of our own
sun, we cannot perceive the
stars, which are nevertheless
the Suns of other Systems. -
