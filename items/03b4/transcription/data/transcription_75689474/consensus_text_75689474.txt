- /_ Amidst such a variety of trials in
different parts of Europe, only one
serious accident happened; & but
[underline]one victim fell,[/underline] in this [underline]dangerous[/underline]
[underline]field of research[/underline] Professor Rickman
of Petersburgh was examining the
Electricity of a thunder cloud by means
of a new instrument which he
called an Electrical Gnomon. - The
experiment was fatal, a discharge
took place with a loud explosion
& the philosopher fell [underline]instantly dead[/underline],
immortalized as the first & the only
martyr to the Science.-
