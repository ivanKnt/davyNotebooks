merit as being the result of thought,
& not of accident; - as being at
once a demonstration of [underline]the principles[/underline]
of the author & a novel &
astonishing combination.-
- The Voltaic battery was as
an alarm bell to [deletion]the slumbering[/deletion]
[deletion]energies of[/deletion] experimenters in every
part of Europe, ( & it seemed no
less for demonstrating new properties
of Electricity [underline]& for establishing[/underline] the
laws [underline]of this Science,[/underline]) than as an
instrument of discovery in other
branches of knowledge; exhibiting
relations between subjects before
apparently without connection,
& serving as a bond of unity
between Chemical & Physical Philosophy.
- In so rich a harvest of
discovery many were anxious to be
partakers. - And perhaps no equal
period of philosophical History
