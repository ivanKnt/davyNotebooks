[underline]Lecture 5[superscript]th[/superscript][/underline]
In the last lecture - My principal
object was to shew that "
the powers of the Voltaic apparatus
& of the common Electrical machine
depend upon the same agent.=.
- And [insertion]to prove that[/insertion] the difference between them
[underline]depends[/underline] upon [insertion]the difference in[/insertion] the intensity &
quantity of the electricity; /_&
the relations between this Intensity
& quantity were defined..
It was shewn that [underline]the[/underline]electricity
of the common Machine [deletion]could[/deletion] can
be made similar to that
of the Voltaic instrument by
[underline]being diffused[/underline] over [underline]a large surface[/underline];
- its quantity being increased whilst

[page]4||dnp03b402pp|75689439[/page]
its intensity is diminished; & it
[insertion][unclear]it[/unclear] was demonstrated[/insertion] that by a great number of
[deletion][unclear]accumulations[/unclear][/deletion][underline]alternations; the intensity[/underline] of
[underline]the Voltaic[/underline] apparatus can be
[underline]exalted so as to[/underline] render
[underline]it analogous to common[/underline]
[underline]Electricity;[/underline] , so as to render
it capable of giving absolutely
the same charge to the
Leyden battery. -
- -. .- And it was proved
by various exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that the
quantity of Electricity belonging
to Voltaic combinations increases
with the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] extent of surface;
- whilst the Intensity is not
influenced by this circumstance;-
- The volume of air which a
spark can pass through is the

[page]5||dnp03b403pp|75689440[/page]

same & the shock given to
the human Body is the same
whether the plates be large
or small but the action of
the large [underline]plates upon metallic[/underline]
[deletion]bodies[/deletion] [insertion]substances[/insertion] is [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] very [underline]much greater[/underline];
& their powers of igniting wire
much more considerable. -
- : . I shall proceed [deletion]to[/deletion] in the
attempt to illustrate the more
[insertion]refined[/insertion] doctrines of Electricity as they
are demonstrated by the powers
of the new instruments of [underline]research[/underline].
& the first subject to which
I shall ask permission to direct
your attention is to an additional
proof of the correctness of
the principle which was brought
forward to explain the accumulation
of Electricity in the Voltaic
Instrument -

[page]6||dnp03b404pp|75689441[/page]
-. This proof is found in what has
been called by its Inventor
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Ritter the Battery of
[underline]Transfer[/underline].-

- :. In this energetic combination
all the powers are carried
to a high degree; /_&
[deletion]& likewise for[/deletion]
from the principles, that
have been laid down it
is easy to infer "that
combinations may be made
in which the energy resulting
from Quantity & those
resulting from intensity may
be exhibited independent of
each other. -. 4 or five
plates of 10 yards square;
would produce a fire
perhaps a thousand times
as intense as this battery:
& some thousand of [insertion]half[/insertion] an inch
square would produce a
shock which would destroy
life; but scarcely any ignition
of [deletion]the[/deletion] Metals.

In a sketch of this nature & in the
time allotted for it, I shall not be expected
to produce a minute History of all the
various insulated experiments that have
been made. /_ My endeavour will be
rather to fix your attention upon the
leading & grand discoveries which form
the epochs of the Science. /_The brilliancy
of Electrical phenomena, & the facility of
producing them led [underline]an immense[/underline] number
of [underline]enquirers into[/underline] this field of research. -
/_ Many have developed new objects in it
but a very few only have ascertained
principles. And in philosophical annals
the fame of subordinate improvers
is necessarily absorbed in that of the
noble inventors, as in military
details the worth of the common
soldier & of the subaltern is as it
were swallowed up in the glory of
the Generals.-
.- The first epoch of Electrical Science

[page]20||dnp03b418pp|75689455[/page]
as I mentioned in the introductory Lecture
must be referred to the time of
[person_383 ]Gilbert[/person_383] & his views are developed
in the treatise "De Magnete" published
in 1600: - /_The Ancients were
acquainted with two electrical
bodies only, Amber, & Lyncurium
(which is either the topaz or tourmaline).
[person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] ascertained that a great
variety of bodies were capable of
being excited, & that the electricity
of bodies was impaired by moist
air & aqueous fluids; but not
by oily & resinous substances: -
his work is worthy of being studied;
& I am surprized that an English
edition of it has never been published. -
[person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] was a man above his age
& [insertion]in his time[/insertion] his philosophy was little attended
to; & one reason why it was
neglected in later [deletion]times[/deletion] [insertion]periods[/insertion] is the
singular reproach thrown upon it

[page]21||dnp03b419pp|75689456[/page]
69
by the great father of modern
experimental philosophy. - "Men" says
he in his book "De augmentis Scientiarum"
are continually carrying too far their
own favourite Theories & endeavouring
to accomplish every thing by their own
peculiar Arts - thus Plato has made
all his Philosophy, Theology; - Aristotle
Logic; & Proclus Mathematics. -
following these Sciences as their first
born Children & making them their
Heirs, to the exclusion of all others. -
So the Chemists explain all things
by the processes of the fire place &
the furnace; & our Countryman
[person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] has attempted to raise a
general system upon the magnet
endeavouring to build a ship out
of materials not sufficient to make
the rowing pins of a boat." - In
another place [person_124]he[/person_124] treats the important
electrical facts which [person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] had
discovered as fables. -
- . The illustrious Critic of the

[page]22||dnp03b420pp|75689457[/page]
Sciences was occasionally [underline]misled[/underline] by
his zeal for the destruction of
[underline]prejudices[/underline], & of false opinions;
& by his contempt for the absurdities
of the ancient Schools. - Anxious
to build up his own great edifice[deletion]s[/deletion]
with his own materials & by his
own strength, he refused all
assistance; & the founder of a
new & grand Philosophy, - he
scorned to blend either the [underline]facts[/underline]
or opinions of [underline]others[/underline], with what
he conceived to be peculiarly his
own work. - Confident of greatness,
& looking with a stedfast eye
towards the creations of his own
noble genius, - he did not fully
see the merit of others - as in
the meridian light of our own
sun, we cannot perceive the
stars, which are nevertheless
the Suns of other Systems. -

[page]23||dnp03b421pp|75689458[/page]

- No one can exceed me in admiration
of this great Man, & it is with a
feeling of humility that I venture
to say that his reproach of [person_383]Gilbert[/person_383]
is unjust. -
- . [person_383]Gilbert[/person_383] undoubtedly considered
the Earth as endowed with magnetic
poles & this is now acknowledged
as a truth: [deletion]& he was far from[/deletion]
[deletion]possessing an unwarrantable Spirit[/deletion]
[deletion]of generalisation[/deletion]. - He perfectly &
most accurately distinguished between
magnetic & electrical attraction - | &
supposed by a singular felicity of
induction, & with a kind of prophetic
Sagacity " that the motions of the
heavenly bodies might [underline]depend upon[/underline]
[underline]a peculiar gravitation[/underline], or attractive
power. He was far from possessing
an unwarrantable Spirit of
generalization in his Latin preface [unclear]he[/unclear]
says in words which

" About 50 years after [person_383]Gilbert,[/person_383]
[superscript]-.[/superscript] Boyle & Hooke & Otto de
Guericke pursued the subject
of Electricity; - And Otto
de Guericke erected the first
Electrical Machine; which was
a Globe of Sulphur whirled
upon an axis & rubbed
against the hand. - " Hawksbee
in 1709. - substituted [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear]/deletion] Globes
& Cylinders of Glass for the
Globe of Sulphur; & has
described in the [insertion]philosophical Transactions &[/insertion] in his physico
Mechanical Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] a great
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] number of [deletion]brilliant[/deletion] y[superscript][unclear]&[/unclear][/superscript] luminous
[deletion]electrical[/deletion] phaenomena of
Electricity. - | The electrical
effects, [insertion]at this time[/insertion] were however referred
to no general principle
& they were [deletion]referred[/deletion] [insertion]explained[/insertion] by

[page]28||dnp03b424pp|75689461[/page]
different enquirers [deletion]to[/deletion]by [insertion]in very[/insertion] different [deletion]causes[/deletion] [insertion]manners[/insertion] 
& referred either to rude mechanical causes or to some occult [insertion]specific[/insertion]
qualities of [deletion]matter[/deletion] different bodies exhibiting them
/_This at first view appears wonderful;
[deletion]for even Newton pursued some[/deletion]
[deletion]electrical enquiries &[/deletion] [insertion]for[/insertion] in the
beginning of the 18 century the methods
of philosophical research attained
their highest degree of perfection, & the
[underline]public mind[/underline] generally speaking seems
to have been in that happy state; in
which the imagination & activity of [underline]Youth[/underline]
are as it were chastened by the correctness
& sagacity of Manhood. - But [insertion]the reason seemed to be that[/insertion] the objects
of the philosophy of the Newtonian School
absorbed for at least half a century
all the attention of Scientific Men. - - .
- - The grand Laws of the System of the
Universe, came upon the Understanding with
that kind of effect which the new
sensations of visions produce on the
blind receiving sight. - The Mathematical
[insertion]Theory of[/insertion] Philosophy & astronomy; the laws of light,
& the motions of the heavenly bodies
were the universal topics of
discussion & admiration. - _\

-. The second Epoch of Electrical
Science cannot [deletion]be[/deletion] fairly be
placed farther back than 1730 -
- The time in which Stephen
[underline][person_392]Grey[/person_392] & [person_393]du Fay[/person_393][/underline] commenced
their labours. - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Greys
papers may be found in
the philosophical Transactions
from 1730 to 1740. - And du
Fays Labors are recorded
in the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences for 1733, 34
& 37. -: [person_392]Grey[/person_392] discovered the
grand distinction between
conductors & non conductors;
& [person_393]du Fay[/person_393] demonstrated [insertion]the still more important principle[/insertion] that
there were two kinds of
Electricities - ".. & that bodies similarly

[page]30||dnp03b426pp|75689463[/page]
electrified attracted each other
& bodies dissimilarly electrified
repelled each other.
/_4 - After the researches of
[person_392]Grey[/person_392] & [insertion]du[/insertion] [person_393]Fay[/person_393] nothing that materially
affected the progress of the
investigation was ascertained
till 1745; - the year of
the discovery of the Leyden Phial,
which may be regarded as constituting
the 3[superscript]rd[/superscript] Epoch in the Science. -
This extraordinary apparatus
was first employed by the Canon
von Kleist of Kamin; but a similar
combination was soon after independently
invented by Cuneus & Muschenbroek
of Leyden. - Kleists form of the
experiment was a phial held
in the hand having a nail
in it. - Muschenbroek's form

[page]31||dnp03b427pp|75689464[/page]
74
was a phial half filled with water.-
- Nothing in the History of Electricity
is more singular than the first accounts
of the [underline]electrical Shock[/underline] as given by
these very feeble & [underline]imperfect instruments[/underline]. -
& the astonishment of the discoverers
seems to have almost deprived them
of their reason.-
- Muschenbroek[deletion]'s[/deletion] in his account
of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript],, written to Reaumur
states "[underline]that the effect from a small[/underline]
[underline]glass bowl was so violent that he[/underline]
[underline]lost his breath & his sensation &[/underline]
[underline]was two days before he recovered[/underline]
[underline]from the effects of the blow & the terror,[/underline]
[underline]& that he would not take a second[/underline]
[underline]shock for the whole Kingdom of France[/underline]."
- It does not require another
example to demonstrate how much the
imagination & the senses influence
each other. - Other Philosophers

[page]32||dnp03b428pp|75689465[/page]
with a much more perfect & more
powerful apparatus, repeated the
exp[superscript]t[/superscript],, without such terrible
effects & referred to the cowardice
of the professor what was truly
only the effect of his surprise.-
- . No single philosophical discovery
ever excited so much popular &
scientific attention as this of
the Leyden Phial - The apparatus
soon became an object of public
exhibition[deletion]s[/deletion]. And in the same
year in which it was discovered,
a number of itinerant experimenters
procured a livelihood in different
parts of Europe by travelling from

V - /_About the middle of the
last Century an immense number of
facts had been ascertained & they
were constantly accumulating &
some principles had been developed,
but a general Theory for connecting
the insulated observations; & giving
them the form of a Body of Science
was still wanting . - /_The foundations
for this Theory were laid by the
ingenuity & industry of our Countryman
D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Watson; the construction of it is
owing to the sagacity of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Franklin
D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Watson ascertained that a communication
with the ground was necessary for the
production of a continued stream
of Electricity by the machine. And
hence he concluded that there was

[page]34||dnp03b430pp|75689467[/page]
an afflux of Electricity from the
conducting bodies to the glass; &
from the glass to the prime conductor.-
*
/_This idea was made known early
in 1747 & towards the middle
of the same year D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Franklin
transmitted his first letter on the subject
to M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Collinson containing an account
of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript],, & observations on Electricity
made at Philadelphia. - In this
letter & in several subsequent
letters in a correspondence that
continued till 1754 he brought
forwards those enlightened ideas
of the subject which have been
so generally admired, [deletion]& adopted[/deletion]
under the name of the [underline]Franklinean[/underline]
[underline]Theory[/underline]. - -
- D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Franklin proved that
the conductor in contact with the
rubber of the electrical machine,
had an opposite electricity from

[page]35||dnp03b431pp|75689468[/page]
76
that of the great conductor; that
the outside & [insertion]the[/insertion] inside of the Leyden
Phial were likewise in opposite
states; & that an equilibirium
was made by their mutual agency.-
& he referred all the phenomena
to the redundancy or deficiency
of a [underline]single[/underline] [underline]fluid[/underline]. -
- The exp[superscript]ts[/superscript],, adduced by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Franklin
in support of his hypothesis, were
most ingeniously contrived & happily
executed. - A singular felicity of
induction guided all his researches;
& by very small means, he established
very [underline]grand truths[/underline].-
- The style & manner of his publication
are almost as worthy of admiration as the
doctrines it contains. - he has endeavoured
to remove all mystery & obscurity from
the subject. - he has written equally
for the uninitiated & for the Philosopher-

[page]36||dnp03b432pp|75689469[/page]
& he has rendered his details amusing
as well as perspicuous - elegant
as well as simple. - Science
appears in his language in a dress
wonderfully decorous, the best adapted
to display her native loveliness. -
He has in no case exhibited that
[underline]false dignity[/underline], by which Philosophy
is kept aloof from common applications -
. /_ [deletion]And[/deletion][deletion&[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion][underline]he has sought[/underline] rather to make her
[underline]an useful inmate & servant[/underline] in the
[underline]common habitations of Men[/underline] than to
preserve her merely as an object
of admiration in temples & palaces
- /_ The [underline]Theory of negative[/underline] & positive
Electricity was soon made by M. Epiniy
of the Academy of S[superscript]t[/superscript]. Petersburgh,
the [underline]subject of mathematical[/underline] illustrations;
/_ & this profound Algebraist has
submitted a great variety of the
conditions of Electrical action to

"an attraction between the electrical fluid
& common bodies". - & an excess or a
deficiency of the fluid or of the matter
over which it is diffused". -

always asserted that they were
merely owing to the electricity

more decisive experiments than
those of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bennet on the
subject. - & this illustrious
Philosopher put the question
beyond doubt by the grand
invention of the new electrical

This noble invention, in which the
powers of this electrical machine

instrument of discovery in other
branches of knowledge; exhibiting
relations between subjects before
apparently without connection,

between Chemical & Physical Philosophy.

to Ehrman we owe a [deletion]clear & distinct[/deletion]
History of the relations of different
conductors to the voltaic apparatus. -
And though Ritter in some of his
conclusions seems to have followed
the impulses of strong imagination rather
than the results of observation, yet
the Science is indebted to him for the
invention of [insertion]several[/insertion] happy combinations [unclear][deletion]by[/deletion] &[/unclear]
[deletion]which the principle of electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]accumulation is considerably elucidated[/deletion]. -
His errors as a theorist seems to be derived
merely from his indulgence in the

[page]54||dnp03b450pp|75689487[/page]
peculiar literary taste of his Country, -
where the metaphysical dogmas of Kant
which as far as I can learn are

before the doctrines of [person_124][insertion]Bacon[/insertion][/person_124] Locke &

Cuthbertson at Haarlem with the

has been done in [insertion]the[/insertion] British[deletion]ain[/deletion] [insertion]Islands[/insertion] but I
scarcely know how to describe with
propriety the distinguished labours of our
[deletion]my[/deletion] Countrymen. - On such an occasion
it is not easy to avoid feelings of
partiality; yet it seems to me in
strict philosophical justice, that
what has been effected by them may
be well put in competition with what
has resulted from the combined exertions
of the Philosophers of the continent of
Europe.-
- It was in [deletion]our Country[/deletion] [insertion]Britain[/insertion] immediately
after the first exhibition of the voltaic
instrument in 1800 - that some of its
