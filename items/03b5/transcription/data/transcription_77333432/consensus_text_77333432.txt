- This appears to be the case from
a number of experiments made by
Beccaria Canton & Cavallo - Metallic
rods elevated into the atmosphere
are generally found negative, of course
the electricity of the surface would
be of the same kind. -
- Now if we conceive that in
instances where atmospherical
Electricity is manifested, the
surface of this Rock becomes
negative, the effect would be
the attraction of the alkali
forming an integrant part of it
to this [underline]surface[/underline], which alkali
would be gradually washed away
by the action of rain. And clay
would result as we find it
always to result free from alkali
from its decomposition. -
