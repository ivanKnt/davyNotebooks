I make this statement & I shall
make some other statements of
the same kind with the conviction
that such analogical reasonings
must be acceptable to my audience
I am far from wishing to push
the consideration of final causes to
in unwarrantable length; but there
are some [insertion]circumstances[/insertion] [deletion]combinations[/deletion] in Nature
[underline]so marked by design[/underline], so wonderful
in their harmonious relations, that
they ought not to be passed by, they
cannot be passed by without
notice & if in the works of
human [deletion]contrivance[/deletion] [insertion]industry[/insertion] [insertion]in the results of feeble power & limited wisdom[/insertion] it is at
once a [insertion]rational[/insertion] pleasure [deletion]& an honour[/deletion]
to admire & understand happy
inventions & ingenious contrivances
for producing effects; How much
more ought we wonder at & to
glory in; the grand arrangements
of Nature flowing from unbounded
power constituted by infinite intelligence
