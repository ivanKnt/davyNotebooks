         <p>Professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia. At the end of the eighteenth
            century he Invented the Voltaic pile which produced electric current and which Davy
            shortly dubbed the battery. Davy described meeting him in 1814 in notebook 14/I, p.38.

         <p>French chemist and tax farmer (for which he was guillotined). Developed a new nomenclature
            for chemistry (much of which is still in use today) and argued strongly against the
            existence of phlogiston. Davy read some of his writings while in Cornwall which he
            then opposed and throughout his career maintained an ambivalent attitude towards Lavoisierian
            chemisty. ForMemRSL.</p>

         <p>A Scottish scientific instrument maker who studied with the chemist Joseph Black at
            Glasgow University. He developed the separate condenser for steam engines which increased
            their effieciency significantly. He took out a twenty-five-year patent (ending in
            1800) and moved to Birmingham where he went into partnership with the businessman
            and industrialist Matthew Boulton. They made their fortune by having an effective
            monopoly of manufacturing steam engines. A friend of Thomas Beddoes, he met Davy on
            a number of occasions and Davy gave the oration at the unveiling of Watt's statue
            in Greenock. FRSL.</p>
