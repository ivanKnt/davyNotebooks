1810
[underline]Electrochemical Science[/underline]
[underline]The effects[/underline] which you
have witnessed in the preceeding
lectures though none of them
are novel & surprising; are
for the most part of limited
application - /_The Subjects which
are now to occupy our
attention, though they offer
appearances [underline]perhaps less brilliant[/underline]
[underline]& less impressive[/underline], are yet
of much more considerable
extent & of much greater
importance.  -

/_ The [underline]operations[/underline] in which
chemistry is concerned,
are [underline]numerous[/underline], both in
the [underline]useful[/underline] & the [underline]refined[/underline]
Arts & are almost
infinite in Nature. -
- [deletion]There is[/deletion] | Hardly a change
can take place on the
surface of the earth, in
the Sea or in [underline]the Air[/underline],
which is not preceded
or followed, by some
[underline]new chemical[/underline] arrangement,
of Matter. -

to this Course I referred
to the nature of chemical

changes: - Whenever a Body
is [deletion]changed[/deletion][insertion]altered[/insertion] in form in
appearance or in intimate
[underline]sensible properties[/underline]; the effect
is said to be [underline]chemical[/underline].
- Thus Lime when an acid
[insertion]such strong vinegar[/insertion] is poured upon it dissolves;
the acid looses its sourness; . . .
the solid earth becomes a liquid
& the taste of this liquid
is unpleasantly bitter. - This
is Chemical action. -
/_The consumption of the
wax & wick of this
candle. - is likewise a
[underline]chemical[/underline] [underline]operation[/underline]. -
The elements of the air
& of the wax are newly
arranged: - And as was
first demonstrated by the

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00004|dnp03b504pp|77333359[/page]
Genius of Hooke; - combustion
is merely [underline]a solution[/underline] of the
burning body [underline]in[/underline] the air;
- the case is analogous to that
of [underline]the solution[/underline] of lime
in the [deletion]vinegar[/deletion] [insertion]acid[/insertion]: - &
there is heat produced in
both instances. -

It is said that the
particles of the lime attract
the particles of the [deletion]vinegar[/deletion] acid
and hence they [underline]unite[/underline] to form
a new body. -
- It is said that the
particles of the wax attract
certain particles in the air /
which are named by the French
oxygenous particles/ - & that
they form together a new
species of Matter. -
This idea of [underline]Chemical[/underline]
[underline]Attraction[/underline] is owing to Newton
who even where he did
not fully investigate yet

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00006|dnp03b506pp|77333365[/page]
always offered important hints
for the occupation of other
minds; - & whose wonderful
sagacity enabled him
to catch a glimpse of
some of the most striking
laws of Electricity &
Chemistry. -
[underline]Precipitation of Lime[/underline]
- I have referred to
Chemical attraction as
[underline]probably[/underline] a different
[underline]exertion[/underline] of the same
power as electrical
[underline]attraction[/underline]; - /_Should
this be proved, it must

- [underline]Lime[/underline] & [underline]acids[/underline] attract
each other chemically: - but
this is when one of them
at least is in [underline]solution[/underline] or
when its particles have freedom
of motion. -
When they are both
[underline]Solids[/underline]; they act electrically:
a piece of dry Lime made
to touch dry chrystals of
any acid; produces electrical
effects; the earth becomes positive
the acid negative. -

evidences in favour of it
are derived from; the
Laws of [underline]electrical decomposition[/underline].
- The [underline]subject[/underline] of the [underline]powers[/underline]
of Electricity as a chemical
agent; requires an extensive
illustration & a series of
diversified exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. - . In [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
begging leave to call your
attention to it - I must
state that it will perhaps
require an exercise of patience;
for many of the effects are
minute, many of the details
I fear tedious; & [deletion]unless [unclear]the[/unclear][/deletion] the interest

[deletion]of the Earth; both by the immediate[/deletion]
[deletion]contact of bodies possessed of energies[/deletion]
[deletion]in a high degree opposed & by[/deletion]
[deletion]induction from the atmosphere, these[/deletion]

[deletion]be continually produced. -[/deletion]
Whenever a surface is negative the

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00026|dnp03b526pp|77333426[/page]
tendency of it must be to occasion
an accumulation of earthy, alkaline
& metallic matter in its vicinity
whenever there is a freedom of
motion in the surrounding arrangements
of substances. - When a surface is
positive an opposite but no less
important order of changes must
occurs. - /_ & many of those
decompositions of rocks, those
degradations of firm solid surfaces;
those changes in soils, those
productions of alkaline & acid
matter for which we have
hitherto been unable to find any
distinct specific causes may be
safely referred to the great
widely diffused & continually
operating powers of electrical
decomposition ...

- Now this Rock is a Basalt & contains
feldspar & hornblende & by decomposition
it affords a red clay. - Now I
found by a careful analysis that
this rock in its state of aggregation
contains alkaline matter. - But
in its state of decomposition as clay
it contains no alkaline matter. -
And if a piece of it when solid
be exposed moistened with water to
the agency of negative Electricity
alkali is developed & the rock
becomes soft at its surface & a
part of it is converted into clay
[underline]Instance.[/underline]
- Now from the condensation of
vapour the atmosphere is generally
positive; & the surface of the Earth
in consequence, is by induction negative

[page]28|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00028|dnp03b528pp|77333432[/page]
- This appears to be the case from
a number of experiments made by
Beccaria Canton & Cavallo - Metallic
rods elevated into the atmosphere
are generally found negative, of course
the electricity of the surface would
be of the same kind. -
- Now if we conceive that in
instances where atmospherical
Electricity is manifested, the
surface of this Rock becomes
negative, the effect would be
the attraction of the alkali
forming an integrant part of it
to this [underline]surface[/underline], which alkali
would be gradually washed away
by the action of rain. And clay
would result as we find it
always to result free from alkali
from its decomposition. -

[page]29|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00029|dnp03b529pp|77333436[/page]
104
- We might generalise upon this
instance. There are few rocks that
do not contain alkaline or calcareous
or fenuginous matters. - |_ Granite
for instance contains all these substances
& it is a rock continually decomposing
at the surface. - And alkali which
abounds in the solid stone is not
to be found in the porcelain Earth
resulting from its decomposition. -
[underline]Instance.[/underline]
- We might apply the same
mode of reasoning to [chemical]chemical_125|porphyry[/chemical], the
different feldspars, shists, to [chemical]chemical_347|trap[/chemical],
& even to common limestone one
of the elements of which [deletion][unclear]xxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]has been seen[/unclear][/deletion] is attracted in a high
degree by negatively electrified

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00030|dnp03b530pp|77333439[/page]
surfaces. - And after these ideas
much of that gradual & superficial
decay so constantly occuring
& which is referred [deletion]to[/deletion] metaphorically to Time
may well be attributed, to the
almost continual operation of
feeble electrical powers. -
And in this point of view
Electricity becomes an agent in
contributing to the production,
continuance & renovation of
[underline]those soils[/underline] which are the beds
of vegetable life. - In providing
for that waste of materials
which is constantly taking place
in consequence of the operation
of water, in rains, springs,
torrents & rivers by which the
finely divided parts of the surface

[page]31|MS-DAVY-10325-000-00031|dnp03b531pp|77333442[/page]
105
are washed from hills & plains into
vallies & finally carried into the
sea. - So that if such conclusions
be admitted, the same cloud which
deposites that water ultimately
the source of the destruction of the
soil, likewise induces that
electricity ultimately the cause
of its renovation. - A happy
& a beautiful circumstance, shewing
how accurately the powers of
Nature are balanced for the
purposes of life. - Shewing
that no advances can be made
towards the discovery of the hidden
[deletion]powers[/deletion] [insertion]agencies[/insertion] operating in the material
Universe, without developing new
views of the power, wisdom &
wonderful combinations by which it is
regulated. -

I make this statement & I shall
make some other statements of
the same kind with the conviction
that such analogical reasonings
must be acceptable to my audience
I am far from wishing to push
the consideration of final causes to
in unwarrantable length; but there
are some [insertion]circumstances[/insertion] [deletion]combinations[/deletion] in Nature
[underline]so marked by design[/underline], so wonderful
in their harmonious relations, that
