In the last lecture it was shown
that almost all [underline]compound[/underline] bodies
are [underline]decompounded[/underline] by Voltaic electricity
& that their elements are separated
[deletion]in such a manner[/deletion] so that such
of them as are naturally
[deletion][underline]positive[/underline][/deletion] in the electrical relations
of [underline]positive[/underline] [deletion][underline]& negative[/underline][/deletion]; are attracted
to the negative surface; & such
of them as are naturally negative
to the positive surface.-. [deletion]Oxygene[/deletion]
[deletion]& acids[/deletion] Inflammable bodies, Metals, metallic
oxides, alkalies & earths belonging
to the one class -" Oxygene [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]oxymuriatic gas,[/insertion]
& acid bodies to the other class.-
- These facts as I stated are in
favour of the idea I that are in
[unclear][deletion]xxx[/deletion][/unclear] chemical & electrical attraction
ultimately depend upon different
