to call the metals of Alkalies
metalloids on account of their
extreme lightness; but the
metals of the earth oppose
this. - : - There appears
to be no good ground
for new arrangements of
[underline]this kind[/underline]; - We must
be guided in classification by
the [insertion]analogies between the[/insertion] greater number [deletion]of [unclear]analog[/unclear][/deletion]
of the properties of bodies;-
& on the same ground that
light metals are excluded
brittle metals might be also
excluded. - Distinctions of
this kind do not belong to
just logic; & they can only
arise in the minds of
Men who attend to words
more than to things.-
