[underline]Electro Chemical Science[/underline]
In the last lecture it was shown
that almost all [underline]compound[/underline] bodies
are [underline]decompounded[/underline] by Voltaic electricity
& that their elements are separated
[deletion]in such a manner[/deletion] so that such
of them as are naturally
[deletion][underline]positive[/underline][/deletion] in the electrical relations
of [underline]positive[/underline] [deletion][underline]& negative[/underline][/deletion]; are attracted
to the negative surface; & such
of them as are naturally negative
to the positive surface.-. [deletion]Oxygene[/deletion]
[deletion]& acids[/deletion] Inflammable bodies, Metals, metallic
oxides, alkalies & earths belonging
to the one class -" Oxygene [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]oxymuriatic gas,[/insertion]
& acid bodies to the other class.-
- These facts as I stated are in
favour of the idea I that are in
[unclear][deletion]xxx[/deletion][/unclear] chemical & electrical attraction
ultimately depend upon different

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10326-000-00002|dnp03b602pp|76085554[/page]
exertions of the same property
of Matter.- I shall now venture
to offer you some [underline]other facts[/underline]
which tend to the same
conclusion; (& whatever be
the fate of the hypothesis;)
I am inclined to believe that
you will consider these facts
as [deletion]neither[/deletion] [insertion]not[/insertion] devoid of importance
& curiosity.-
- : If the [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]faculty[/insertion] of combination
of Bodies be owing to "[deletion]an[/deletion] a peculiar
arrangement of [underline]their parts[/underline], [ or
[underline]to powers[/underline] which are exhibited
by electrical energies.- this faculty
[deletion]however[/deletion] ought to be [underline]bestowed[/underline]
in some cases; as we have
 seen it [underline]destroyed[/underline] in others.
-: Thus [deletion]by giving[/deletion] if the theory be true

in the positive state positive in [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
a higher degree, its powers of
[underline]combination[/underline] with negative matter
ought to be exalted; - but
by rendering it negative its
power ought to be destroyed.-
- How this we shall find
to be [underline]the fact[/underline].
[underline]Silver[/underline] - [underline]not easily oxidable[/underline]
rendered positive
Copper rendered negative
gives no solution.-
in these instances exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] perfectly
harmonize with theory.-
-:. There [underline]are other[/underline] series of
facts connected with chemical
& electrical action which likewise
harmonize with the theory &
with each other.

- Whenever there is an
equilibrium of [underline]this kind[/underline] .
the result is the same.
How will chemical change

brought into play.-

And the effect would be
the same if the salt
were heated till it begins
to give off oxygene-

cannot be easily explained on

[underline]capacity for heat[/underline]. - latent
Heat: According to the
electrochemical [underline]doctrine[/underline]; It is
a consequence of an action which we
are certain [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]must exist[/insertion].- The
production of heat in this case
is like the production of
[underline]heat[/underline] by these pieces of charcoal
The ignition as you saw on a prior
occasion takes place in vacuo-
& there is no source from which
heat can be derived except
in the annihilation of the
two electricities, - Let not the
[underline]Newtonian law[/underline] be broken, let
not unknown causes be called
to our aid unless known
causes are inadequate to explain
the phaenomenon.-

The first [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] substance that
[deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]I made[/insertion] a subject of exp[superscript]t[/superscript],, was Potash

vague & unfounded notions
had been formed of the nature
& composition of this body. It had
been supposed by some of the [insertion]Italian &[/insertion]
French Chemists to consist of lime
& hydrogene. - By others it had
been regarded as containing [underline]Nitrogene[/underline].
- The suspician strongest in my
mind was that it might consist
of Phosphorous or Sulphur united
to Nitrogene. - for as the volatile
alkali was regarded as composed
of an extremely light inflammable
body hydrogene united to Nitrogene -
I conceived that [underline]Phosphorus[/underline] & Sulphur
