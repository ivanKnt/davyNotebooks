               <p>Calico was a type of brightly printed cotton fabric imported from India. It posed a threat to England's wool industry, and its importation was banned in 1700. England began printing their own plain cottons, the process of which involved bleaching in alkaline solutions and later sulphuric acid and chlorine. </p>
