[underline]Lecture 1810[/underline]
- In the last lecture I started
to give the History of the
discovery of [deletion]the[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical].
& its combinations with [deletion]water[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
& the composition of the
Atmosphere; & the production

[deletion]- About three years[/deletion] - Two or three years
after [person]person_016|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley[/person] had made
his first experiments, upon
[chemical]chemical_048|[underline]Nitrous gas[/underline][/chemical], in exposing this
substance to moistened iron
filings, He [deletion]discovered[/deletion] ascertained that
it underwent a considerable
diminution; & that it gained
the power of supporting the

[underline]combustion of the taper.[/underline] - He
conceived that in this case
the [chemical]chemical_048|Nitrous air[/chemical] had been
deprived of a part of
its [chemical]chemical_046|Phlogiston[/chemical] or inflammable
matter; & hence it
[deletion]it[/deletion] had a stronger attraction
for [underline]this principle[/underline]: & He
called the substance Dephlogisticated
[chemical]chemical_048|[underline]Nitrous air[/underline][/chemical].-
-. He ascertained that there
were several other modes
of procuring it.-
- By Sol: of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical]
or iron in very diluted
[chemical]chemical_143|[underline]Nitric acid[/underline][/chemical].

[person]person_561|Bucholz[/person] shewed that the [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical]
this gas affords is derived
from the glass & not
formed as [person]person_224|Scheele [/person]&

[unclear][person]person_630|Wagleb[/person][/unclear]
[person]person_621|Meyer[/person]. demonstrated the source of
the [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical], by putting an equal quantity
of [chemical]chemical_322|Fluor spar[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] into three [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical]
vessels, adding to one 1 oz of glass, to another 1 oz
of [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical]. covering all three with moistened sponges

Exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on its decomposition
- [underline]by Potassium[/underline] 
From this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it
would appear that [chemical]chemical_056|fluoric[line]acid[/chemical] is a [underline]neutral[/underline]
salt in the [underline]gaseous[/underline] state
consisting of an acid
[underline]unknown[/underline] in its pure
form of [underline]an earth[/underline] &
of [underline]water[/underline]; - And
from the phaenomena
of its decomposition it
would appear that
the acid bears the same

relation to a peculiar
inflammable body, as
the acids of [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] &
[chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] do to these
bodies. -
- In this instance analogy
is conformable to the
progress of [deletion]investigation[/deletion]
experimental investigation;
& on further enquiry
this new fact will
I doubt become [deletion]an[/deletion] a
means of our acquiring
additional information
respecting the real nature
of [underline]acid bodies[/underline]; & the
powers which determine
this property. - Even

the few [deletion]facts[/deletion] phaenomena
exhibited in this lecture
& there are many others
of the same kind prove;
that that part of the
antiphlogistic theory which
makes acidity dependent
upon [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] is altogether
devoid of foundation
- And the fate of so
splendid a theory ought
at least to teach us
caution.-
