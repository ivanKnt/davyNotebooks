[underline]Lecture 1810[/underline]
- In the last lecture I started
to give the History of the
discovery of [deletion]the[/deletion] Nitrous gas.
& its combinations with [deletion]water[/deletion] oxygene
& the composition of the
Atmosphere; & the production
of [underline]Water[/underline] from oxygene gas
& Hydrogene gas.-
[deletion]- About three years[/deletion] - Two or three years
after D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley had made
his first experiments, upon
[underline]Nitrous gas[/underline], in exposing this
substance to moistened iron
filings, He [deletion]discovered[/deletion] ascertained that
it underwent a considerable
diminution; & that it gained
the power of supporting the

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10327-000-00002|dnp03b702pp|91026898[/page]
[underline]combustion of the taper.[/underline] - He
conceived that in this case
the Nitrous air had been
deprived of a part of
its phlogiston or inflammable
matter; & hence it
[deletion]it[/deletion] had a stronger attraction
for [underline]this principle[/underline]: & He
called the substance Dephlogisticated
[underline]Nitrous air[/underline].-
-. He ascertained that there
were several other modes
of procuring it.-
- By Sol: of Zinc Tin
or iron in very diluted
[underline]Nitric acid[/underline].
&c.

- About 1780 M[superscript]r [/superscript]Berthollet
[underline]discovered[/underline] a simpler mode

Nitrous gas as I mentioned
in [underline]the last lecture[/underline] is composed
of nearly 1 of oxygene & 1 of
Nitrogene in Volume; & as
Nitric acid is formed by
2 of Nitrous gas & 1 of
oxygene, it follows that

[deletion]Nitrous acid[/deletion] [insertion]this body[/insertion] must be composed
of about 1 of Nitrogene &

[underline]conclusion[/underline] was indeed made

any accurate exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] had been
made on the decomposition
of [underline]Nitrous gas[/underline].-
[deletion]- the In the year 17[/deletion]
- In the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] which
this illustrious philosopher made

this was owing to the

- And Nitric acid when saturated
with Nitrous gas seems to consist
of about - 3 of Nitrous gas & 1
of Oxygene; - & some Chemists
suppose it in this case to
be quite a distinct acid.-
- I shall beg of you to keep in
mind these circumstances as we
shall hereafter find them applicable
to some of the more recondite
& sublime conclusions of Chemistry;
- Combined with other facts of the

that substances which we at present

In the ancient operation oxygene
was supplied only by the long

process of nature is not only
imitated but exceedingly accelerated
The workman is enabled to
carry on his works in a small

bleaching ground before unproduction
of food is now converted into

[underline]Oxymuriatic acid[/underline] is that
which has been considered

which oxygene may be

- The researches which

Which ever of these theories be
adopted still practical applications
of considerable importance will
result from these new facts;-
they shew that in all cases
in which attempts are made
to decompound Muriates
water should be present.
- And I find that dry
muriates cannot be decompounded
by any dry acid -
But when Water is present
these changes are easily affected
- It is well known that

& that Soda is an article
