[deletion]seen, like light, is capable of being[/deletion]
[deletion]reflected[/deletion] & like light, it is much
more perfectly reflected by some bodies
than by others, & there is a very
disinct connection between the colours
of substances, & their reflecting powers. -
Thus white bodies, reflect more than
yellow, yellow more than red,
red more than green, green more
than blue, blue more than indigo
& black produced no reflection. - &
if the face of this mirror were to be
covered in different experiments with
these colours in succession. - Its power
of reflection, and of producing a Heat
making focus would be gradually
diminished, & when the coating was
black, it would be altogether lost. -
- When heat falls on bodies that
do not reflect it, it is absorbed,
