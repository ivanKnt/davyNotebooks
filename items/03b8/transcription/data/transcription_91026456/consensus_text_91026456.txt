exposed to heat, the lower surface
should be tarnished or blacked
the surfaces by which the vessel
is cooled should be as polished
& bright as possible; All
dishes likewise for preserving
meats warm should be
as bright as possible. So
that beside all other means
for elegance & cleanliness
there is an absolutely
[underline]Philosophical reason[/underline] -
Steam tubes or stoves, which
are intended to warm rooms
is to radiate heat should
be dark coloured; & if
& metal painted or blackend,
Tubes for conveying steam
into apartments in the
points where they are not
required to give off heat
should be as brilliant &
polished as possible
