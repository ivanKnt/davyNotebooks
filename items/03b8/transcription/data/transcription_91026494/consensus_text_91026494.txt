of the stratum of Air in contact
with the Earth are constantly taking
place. And these effects there
is every reason to believe must
be connected with certain changes
of temperature, which when the
alteration of pressure is sudden
or rapid, may be perceptible,
or may operate, with other causes,
in producing the mean degree. -
- The increased pressure of
the atmosphere, seems to be
occasioned usually by the
flowing in & descent of a
[underline]Colder[/underline] stratum of Air in the
upper Regions of the atmosphere, &
the dimination of pressure is owing
to the flowing in & ascent of a
[underline]warm[/underline] body of elastic fluid. -
