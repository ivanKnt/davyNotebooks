(So that the affections of the lower
atmosphere in [underline]consequence[/underline] must tend
[underline]to equalise the temperature - Heat[/underline]
being generated, in one case, &
[underline]cold[/underline] in the other. - 
- Fluid by calculation from
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dalton's experiments on the heat
evolved, during the compression of
Air; that an increase of pressure
upon the lowest stratum equal to
that of an inch of mercury would
produce an increase of nearly three
degrees of temperatures, & an equal
diminution of pressure could occasion
an equal depression of temperature;
That is taking the mean pressure as
equal to 29 inches & half of mercury
in the Barometer & supposing the
Thermometer to stand at fifty five. -
Other circumstance being similar, a
change of density denoted by 30 inches
