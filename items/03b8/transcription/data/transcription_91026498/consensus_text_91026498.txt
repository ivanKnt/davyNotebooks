are composed of moisture precipitated
from the air, by the cooling agency
of water. - (The Vapours deposited
from the rarefaction of the dense
lower stratum of air, generally form
[underline]rapidly about the middle of the[/underline]
[underline]mountain as soon as it becomes[/underline]
[underline]shaded. - They are seldom circular[/underline]
[underline]in their form.[/underline] & surround the sides
like a belt. -
- The Clouds produced by the
cooling agency of water are generally
much denser. - They begin in the
lowest part of the valley & slowly
extend upwards, [underline]presenting[/underline] curved
& distinct outlines. -
- In the South of Ireland, in
the neighbourhood of the Lake
