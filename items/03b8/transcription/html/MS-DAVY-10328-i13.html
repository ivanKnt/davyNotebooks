         <p>Born in Massachusetts, he served in the British and Bavarian armies. Knighted by George
            III in 1787, the Elector of Bavaria created him Reichsgraf von Rumford of the Holy
            Roman Empire in 1792. His appointment in the late 1790s as Bavarian ambassador to
            London created a minor diplomatic incident, during which he helped establish and manage
            the Royal Institution, in the course of which he appointed Davy to lecture there.
            Later he married Lavoisier's widow and lived unhappily ever after. FRSL.</p>
