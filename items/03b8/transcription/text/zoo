[underline]Lecture[/underline] 9
[underline]On the Laws of Heat, Light[/underline]
[underline]& Electricity.[/underline] -
I shall proceed in the illustration
of the principal discoveries that
have been made respecting Heat;
& I shall [deletion][unclear]xxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] venture to
offer some general views of the
connection existing between Heat,
Light & Electricity. -
- You saw in the last lecture
that heat is capable of being
reflected [insertion]like light[/insertion] & of being concentrated
to a focus. -
[deletion]It had long been observed that[/deletion]
A
[deletion]there was a distinct connection[/deletion]
[deletion]between the colours of bodies[/deletion]
[deletion]& their power of reflecting [deletion]&[/deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]absorbing[/deletion] heat, as well as light[/deletion]

[page]2||dnp03b802pp|91026450[/page]
- [deletion]Radiant Heat, then [unclear]xx xxxx[/unclear] have[/deletion]
[deletion]seen, like light, is capable of being[/deletion]
[deletion]reflected[/deletion] & like light, it is much
more perfectly reflected by some bodies
than by others, & there is a very
disinct connection between the colours
of substances, & their reflecting powers. -
Thus white bodies, reflect more than
yellow, yellow more than red,
red more than green, green more
than blue, blue more than indigo
& black produced no reflection. - &
if the face of this mirror were to be
covered in different experiments with
these colours in succession. - Its power
of reflection, and of producing a Heat
making focus would be gradually
diminished, & when the coating was
black, it would be altogether lost. -
- When heat falls on bodies that
do not reflect it, it is absorbed,

[page]3||dnp03b803pp|91026451[/page]
139
& becomes common heat of temperature,
& consequently those bodies that reflect
least heat, become hottest when exposed
to radiant Heat, |_ & with regard to
colours, there is the inverse order.
A thermometer painted white would be
[deletion]scarcely[/deletion] [insertion]comparatively little[/insertion] affected by burning Coals in
the focus of the mirror, whilst one
painted black, would immediately
indicate the elevation of temperature.
Instance
These facts have been known for
some time, but there is another curious
property of bodies, with regard to
radiation, that has been only very
lately discovered.
Different bodies heated to the same
temperature, give out radiant heat
with very different degrees of quickness
& their power of emitting radiant heat.

[page]4||dnp03b804pp|91026452[/page]
is directly as their power of absorbing it,
or inversely as their power of reflecting
it.
This tin Cube instance. -
Metals least, porcelain better animal & vegetable
substances worst of all.
This curious discovery was made
nearly at the same time by Count
Rumford & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslie, [deletion]& it explains[/deletion]
Lamp black 100 - Cruz glass 90
[deletion]many phenomena before obscure[/deletion]
[deletion]& nearly completes[/deletion] [insertion]considerably advances[/insertion] the generalisation[/deletion] [insertion]Mercury 20 Tin plate 12[/insertion]
[deletion]of facts belonging to the subject.[/deletion]
[deletion]A number of important Natural[/deletion]
[deletion]phenomena depend upon the effects[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]of Radiation.[/underline] It is one of the prime[/deletion]
[deletion]Causes, both of the Cooling & the[/deletion]
[deletion]heating of bodies, & by means of[/deletion]
[deletion]radiation, the Earth annually sends[/deletion]
[deletion]off as much Heat into free space,[/deletion]
[deletion]as the influence of the sun or of[/deletion]
[deletion]terrestrial processes had communicated.[/deletion]
[deletion]And thus the uniformity of its temperature[/deletion]
[deletion]considered as a great whole is preserved.[/deletion]

[page]5||dnp03b805pp|91026453[/page]
140
There are many popular & practical
applications of it [deletion]these xxxxxxxx[/deletion] &
it is easy to find a glimpse
of the [insertion]knowledge of the[/insertion] difference of the [insertion]different[/insertion] radiating
powers of bodies in some facts, that
have been often observed & often
questioned - It has been always
believed [insertion]by the persons not practically acquainted with the subject[/insertion] [deletion]that metallic vessels[/deletion]
[deletion]presen[/deletion] Ladies who preside at the
tea table that metallic vessels
preserve fluids hot longer & [deletion]make[/deletion]
[deletion]section[/deletion] enable them to extract stronger
infusions from vegetable subtances
than vessels of Porcelain: &
the silver teapot set on this account
was regarded not only as a
more elegant but as a more
oeconomical apparatus. - For
some time this idea was treated
by Philosophers as a refined
prejudice - It was said metals
are better conductors of Heat
than earths; & therefore they

[page]6||dnp03b806pp|91026454[/page]
must cool liquids faster. - I
to have been always accustomed deference
to pay great deference to the opinions of the
sex - Because I am convinced
of their superior delicacy of
fact & minuteness of observation
- I made the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] many
years ago. & ventured to
oppose the common scientific
opinion in this room; & at
that time I conceived that
I had discovered the reason
of the superiority of the
silver over the porcelain
vessel in the circumstances
- That as the coldest structure
of fluid must [underline]possess the greatest[/underline]
specific gravity: - the [unclear]naked[/unclear] communication
of Heat, between the upper hot
stratum by the metallic sides
& the lower cooled stratum would

[page]7||dnp03b807pp|91026455[/page]
141
tend to preserve the temperature
of the [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]part[/insertion] where the infusion
was going on [underline]higher - than[/underline]
in the case in which the
substance of the vessel was a
bad conductor - I doubt
not that this circumstance
had an effect in assisting
the general operation; but the
great cause of difference
is the inferior radiating power
of porcelain; which absolutely
coolest the liquid faster, &
which is so much the greater
in proportion as the surface
is less polished & dark coloured
- The black wedwood ware cools
more quickly. - The glazed [deletion]& gilt[/deletion]
white ware [deletion]the[/deletion] least quickly
& ware covered with gold leaf
or plating is the most perfect
of all in this respect
It is obviously that in all vessels

[page]8||dnp03b808pp|91026456[/page]
exposed to heat, the lower surface
should be tarnished or blacked
the surfaces by which the vessel
is cooled should be as polished
& bright as possible; All
dishes likewise for preserving
meats warm should be
as bright as possible. So
that beside all other means
for elegance & cleanliness
there is an absolutely
[underline]Philosophical reason[/underline] -
Steam tubes or stoves, which
are intended to warm rooms
is to radiate heat should
be dark coloured; & if
& metal painted or blackend,
Tubes for conveying steam
into apartments in the
points where they are not
required to give off heat
should be as brilliant &
polished as possible

[page]9||dnp03b809pp|91026457[/page]
142
These observations may perhaps
appear trivial; [deletion]may possible[/deletion]
but are of the
first & hottest characteristics
of Philosophy is its improvement
of the Arts of Life -
& Science cannot be the
[deletion]less dignified for being useful[/deletion]
[deletion]useful[/deletion]. It is sometimes
urged as a [underline]reproach[/underline] to
discoveries that they have
no immediate application.
-: & it is [underline]therefore more[/underline]
[underline]necessary[/underline] to dwell upon
uses arising even from the most
[deletion]abstracted[/deletion] [insertion]refined[/insertion] truths.- It
is the peculiarity of chemical

[page]10||dnp03b810pp|91026458[/page]
Philosophy; that whilst it
unfolds the most sublime
& refined parts of the
oeconomy of nature, it is
subservient to familiar purposes;
[deletion]& to the common wants of [/deletion]
[deletion]life[/deletion]. Like the Parian marble
marble. it is fitted for
use or for beauty, either
or dwelling houses or
temples; - either to exhibit
the simplicity of Nature
or the grandeur & excellence
Of Art. -

- The warmth of our habitations in a
great measure depends upon the
continued [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]production[/insertion] & reflection of
heat making rays. - If Heat
passed from Body to body merely
by simple contact or communication.
The quantity of [underline]cold[/underline] air entering
our rooms by different apertures
would be as great as the quantity
of Hot air conceived out of them,
through the chimneys of [underline]fire places[/underline]-
& little or no elevation of temperature
would be produced. - 
Radiant Heat, however passes through
all currents of Air. - Its velocity is
impeded by no perturbations, [deletion]&[/deletion]
undulations, & it is in a constant
state of action & of motion. -

[page]12||dnp03b812pp|91026460[/page]
- The diminution of Cold
which is generally experienced in
severe weather, when the atmosphere
becomes clouded, - is owing to the
radiation of Heat, from the [underline]Clouds[/underline]
which are usually in intense cold
[insertion]weather[/insertion] in our Climate, of a lower temperature
than the surface. -
- The first cooling effect of a
snow Cloud in [underline]autumn[/underline], the influence
of which is experienced, the moment
it appears - must depend upon
the radiation of Heat from the Earth
to the Cloud. - ( The agency
of an approaching shower in the
Sultry time of Sumer is of the
same kind; - & the cooling operation
of the [underline]mists[/underline] on the tops of Mountains,
extends in a similar manner to their
sunny [underline]bases[/underline], & the warm [underline]Vallies[/underline]
[underline]below[/underline]. -

[deletion]- [person_143]A very ingenious Philosopher[/person_143];[/deletion]
[deletion]in extending the principle of radiation[/deletion]
[deletion]has supposed, that the earth is cooled[/deletion]
[deletion]not only by the emission of its own[/deletion]
[deletion]heat; - but likewise by frigorific[/deletion]
[deletion]radiations from different parts of[/deletion]
[deletion]the Heavens. - This source does[/deletion]
[deletion]not seem to be at all neccessary,[/deletion]
[deletion]it is founded upon the opinion of[/deletion]
[deletion]cold as a positive quality; & it[/deletion]
[deletion]is liable to the same [underline]kind of objections,[/underline][/deletion]
[deletion]as those made to the singularly absurd[/deletion]
[deletion]Theory of the Dutchmen, who aserted[/deletion]
[deletion]that Night, did not depend upon[/deletion]
[deletion]the absence of the Solar Light, but[/deletion]
[deletion]upon the [underline]obfuscating[/underline] influence of[/deletion]
[deletion]certain heavenly Bodies that acted in[/deletion]
[deletion]opposition to the Sun, & emitted[/deletion]
[deletion]rays producing darkness. -[/deletion]

- The Rays of [unclear]common Heat[/unclear]
though they appear to pass through
Air in the same manner
as the Rays from the
Sun yet do not pass
with the same facility
through all transparent [underline]media[/underline].

any perceptible heat

[page]15||dnp03b815pp|91026463[/page]

These circumstances have led M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Leslie to conceive that "what
is considered as radiant invisible
Heat is nothing more than
a series of pulsations or undulations
of heated air; which like sound
are capable of being [deletion]reflected [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]through air[/deletion] reflected but not
refracted. This notion is
certainly very ingenious but
it does not appear to
be supported by the facts; &
it is strongly opposed by some
experiments which the Voltaic
apparatus has enable me to
make & which I shall have the
honour of exhibiting to you.
Heat is reflection in vacuo
where there would be no
sound.
Instance.

3 Refraction by a [underline]good lens[/underline].
& Air [underline]Thermometer.[/underline] -

[page]16||dnp03b816pp|91026464[/page]
It might be said that in
these experiments the [underline]Heat[/underline] arises
solely from the light that
passes through the glass; but
a full answer is furnished
to this objection in the
capital discovery of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Herchell |_ "that even the
[underline]Heat[/underline] of even the Solar Rays
is capable of being separated
from the Light. -
Newton
Newton in passing a ray of light
through a prism found it decomp -
-osed into a varity of coloured
lights of which the most distinct
were red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo and violet, - Peculiar

[page]17||dnp03b817pp|91026465[/page]
146
circumstances which it would be
little interesting to describe led D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Herchell to introduce [underline]thermometers[/underline]
into these different coloured
rays: & he found no Heat exhib -
-ited towards the violet or least
refrangible part of the Spectrum
and the temperature increased
towards the red rays and was
greater in these rays than in any
others - coloured rays; and carrying
the thermometer beyond the red
rays, He found that in a small
space [underline]beyond them[/underline] the greatest
effect of all was produced

[page]18||dnp03b818pp|91026466[/page]
So that the most energetic of the
heat making rays here were perf -
-ectly independent of & distinct from
light. In the blue in Do[insertion]min[superscript][/superscript]ts[/insertion] - 55 to 56
Green - Do - 54 to 58
Yellow - Do 56 to 62
Red - 2 1/2 56 - to 72
Soon after these various facts had
been announced some objections
were made to D[superscript]r[/superscript] Herchells methods
of operating - but new experiments
conducted by very able & judicious
philosophical persons fully confirmed
the principal results - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Pictet &
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Prevost both gave their testimony

[page]19||dnp03b819pp|91026467[/page]
147
in favour of the existence of the
invisible Heat making rays less
refrangible than the rays of light.
And in a process conducted by
Sir H[superscript]y[/superscript] Englefield which I had
the pleasure of witnessing the
phenomena was in the highest
degree distinct. -
All causes of the interference were
carefully awarded - The different
Rays separated by the prism were
respectively concentered in the
focus of a lens and successivily
thrown upon a very delicate
thermometer - The temperature

[page]20||dnp03b820pp|91026468[/page]
became elevated in the differ-
-ent rays in the order described,
& on the least refrangible side
where the blush of red scarcely,
extended the increase of Heat
in the focus was considerably
the greatest -
There seem to have always
existed some popular notions conf-
-ormable to his discovery - Thus
red and orange are called
warm colours, & blue and violet
cold colours - And in these
instances the evidence of the
senses as it was preceeded

observations - /_ The properties of burning
Bodies likewise might confirm
or [underline]assist the idea[/underline]. - /_ For the red
glow of ignited metal or coals is
infinitely stronger in its effects than
the blue flame of Sulphur or Spirits
of wine. -
The existence of invisible Heat mak-
-ing beams had been suspected by
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton – He indeed conceived
that all radient Heat was
merely light in another Form. -
but His opinions were the
result of speculation and warr-
-anted by no experiments. -

[page]22||dnp03b822pp|91026470[/page]
In the Epicurian School a similar
Hypothises was maintained &
Lucretius develops it in fifth
book in attempting to account
for the permancy of the solar fires. -
"Or else the Sun emits
Besides the Heavenly golden light
Invisible elements of Potent Heat [insertion]of day[/insertion]
Which burns for ever" -
The opinion
of [person_644]Leslie[/person_644]
If this radiation of invisible
heat is not admitted there is
no reason for supposing that the
Earth emits any of the heat
it receives, of course an

[page]23||dnp03b823pp|91026471[/page]
149
elevation of temperature ought
constantly to be taking place
& the conclusions to which it
leads are similar to those
adopted by the antient weeping
Philosopher Heraclitus; [deletion]& by[/deletion] [insertion]who regarded[/insertion]
fire as the great element from which
[deletion]M. de Maillet[/deletion] the author of
every thing had arisen & which would gradually
[deletion]Thalliames - Namely that the[/deletion]

[deletion]seas must become dry, our[/deletion]
[deletion]water dissipated, our vegetation[/deletion]
[deletion]destroyed & a conflagration[/deletion]
[deletion]gradually come on & increase[/deletion]
[deletion]through a succession of ages.. -[/deletion]
- M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslie, whose hypothesis
respecting the pulsations of heated
air is conformable to this [insertion]idea[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxinous[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]system[/deletion], has made some refined
calculations to show the progress of the increase
of temperature, which he states at one
degree in 2405 years -

[page]24||dnp03b824pp|91026472[/page]
From such an increase we undoub-
-tedly should be in no danger and
if he had made it 20 degrees in
the same time - [underline]Our Climate[/underline] would
merely suffer improvement in consequ-
-ence and 100 generations would pass
away, before any inconvenience could
be felt in the more northern or
southern latitudes; but in the great
system such an elevation of tempera -
-ture would be a serious evil, parts
of the tropics now fertile luxuriant
in their vegetation & just within the
limits of a habitable temperature
would become burning and sandy
desarts, & [deletion]the quantity[/deletion], & the quantity
life would in the whole be diminished

There can be no doubt from the testing
many of the Roman authors, that the
winters in Germany & Italy were
somewhat colder 2000 years ago than
they are at present; but since that
period immense forests have been felled
on the Rhine and the Danube. -
& the greater [insertion]parts[/insertion] of the districts to the
north of the Alps [insertion]has has been been[/insertion] cultivated & this
appears a cause fully adequate [underline]to the[/underline]

M[superscript]r[/superscript] Lisle thinks from his own
observations that the glaciers of
Switzerland, & the Tyrol are daily
diminishing: but it has been the
opinion of two, amongst the most

[page]26||dnp03b826pp|91026474[/page]
enlightened of the Philosophers of
modern times both of whom were
Natives of the country; & ardent

[deletion]And the experience of Men[/deletion]

[deletion]one of whom had been an attentive[/deletion]

[deletion]must undoubtedly be considered as of[/deletion]

- The production of Heat by the friction
of solid Bodies, or by briskly rubbing
them together, in a dry state, has been
known from the earliest times, &
[underline]amongst the most barbarous Nations[/underline]. -
- Lucretius in his highly elequent
& impressive description of the origin
of Society, supposes that in the
operations of Nature, [underline]combustion[/underline]
[underline]might have[/underline] been produced by the
[underline]violent friction of branches of trees[/underline]
[underline]in Woods when agitated by[/underline]
Storms; & that this circumstance
may have led to the discovery
of the artificial excitation
& uses of fire. -
"Or agitated by the restless air"
" the nodding branches of the parched, [insertion]wood[/insertion]
"Burst into flame; which nurtured

"Extended with restless [deletion]energy[/deletion] [insertion]force[/insertion]" -
- This however is a mere poetical
idea, unwarranted by History, or tradition
possible, - but not probable. - 
- The Natives of New Holland
who perhaps are the lowest of human
beings in the scale of Civilization,
possess the mode of inflaming wood
by friction, & they effect it by making
a small hole in a piece of dry wood.
They introduce into this hole, the sharp
point of a [insertion]cyclindrical[/insertion] piece of wood, & they
move this round as rapidly as possible
in their hands, till it begins to
smoke, dry leaves are strewed
round, & the process continued
till inflammation takes place.-
The operation requires however
some dexterity & Europeans unaccustomed

[page]40||dnp03b840pp|91026488[/page]
to it are unable to perform the motion
with sufficient rapidity to produce
the effect.
- Heat capable of burning the
fingers may be produced merely
by rubbing them briskly upon a
piece of woollen cloth
Indian Rubber
- In the different Mechanical
Arts, a great variety of instances
of the excitation of Heat by friction
occur. - The fact is sometimes
terribly exemplified [insertion]in the problem of powder mills & disagreeably expressed[/insertion] in the burning
of the wheels of Carriages, when
the axle has not been perfectly
greased. - 
- [underline]Heat[/underline] likewise is capable of
being produced by percussion. -
It is not an uncommon practice

[page]41||dnp03b841pp|91026489[/page]

amongst Smiths, to light their fires
by hammering a piece of soft iron
upon the anvil & an expert
workman can easily make iron
red hot by ten or twelve well
applied blows. -
- A similar effect is produced
by Collision. - In the common
Gun Lock, the particles of the Steel
abraded by the flint are sufficiently
heated to burn in the atmosphere &
it is their combustion that fires the
Gunpowder. -
- It had been observed by the
first Experimenters upon the Air Guns
that the compressing springs became
very hot, during the charging of
the reservoirs, or the [underline]hollow Sphere[/underline]

[page]42||dnp03b842pp|91026490[/page]
for containing, the condensed air;
& the effect was ascribed to
friction, later experiments however
have shown that heat is evolved
to a considerable degree in the
compression of Air in such a
degree indeed as to produce the
inflammation of certain combustible
bodies. -
- M.. Biot introduced a
mixture of inflammable air &
pure air, that is of hydrogene
& oxygene into a hollow cylinder
of brass - having a tight piston -
He made a compression by the
piston. - an inflammation took
place with a considerable

[page]43||dnp03b843pp|91026491[/page]
158
explosion by which the cylinder
burst into pieces. - 
- By the strong compression of
common air, combustible Tinder
may be inflamed, & a very
slight compressing power will cause
phosphorous to take fire. The fact
has been applied to practical purposes,
& small cylinders have been made
to serve the same purpose as tinder
boxes. - 
[underline]Instance Instruments[/underline]
- When an Air Gun is discharged
in the dark - a flash of light is
perceived. - This probably depends
upon the pressure exerted by the
expanding air upon the free
contiguous Atmosphere. -
- If a piston is used having

[page]44||dnp03b844pp|91026492[/page]
a thick glass lens adapted to it
in such a manner that the
interior of the cylinder for
compression may be visible
through it, it is perceived
that [underline]light[/underline] is produced with the
[underline]Heat[/underline], in the common experiment
of compression. - 
- When Air is rarefied by
the removal of compressing powers
cold is produced & the
temperature of the Bodies in
contact, or the contiguous bodies
diminished. - This is easily
seen in an experiment with
the air pump
[underline]Instance[/underline].
This instance is the converse

[page]45||dnp03b845pp|91026493[/page]
159
of the last. (The mist which
is seen in exhausting the Air pump
depends on the condensation of moisture
in consequences of the Cold, & not
upon any diminution of the solvent
powers of the air by rarefaction,
for it disappears again as soon
as the common temperature is
restored. -
- When air is introduced into
the [underline]exhausted[/underline] receiver the same
diminution of temperature is perceived
from its sudden expansion, the same
effect upon the thermometer. & the same
condensation of moisture. -
- The changes of the height
of the column of Mercury in the
Barometrical tube prove that
changes in the state of compression

[page]46||dnp03b846pp|91026494[/page]
of the stratum of Air in contact
with the Earth are constantly taking
place. And these effects there
is every reason to believe must
be connected with certain changes
of temperature, which when the
alteration of pressure is sudden
or rapid, may be perceptible,
or may operate, with other causes,
in producing the mean degree. -
- The increased pressure of
the atmosphere, seems to be
occasioned usually by the
flowing in & descent of a
[underline]Colder[/underline] stratum of Air in the
upper Regions of the atmosphere, &
the dimination of pressure is owing
to the flowing in & ascent of a
[underline]warm[/underline] body of elastic fluid. -

[page]47||dnp03b847pp|91026495[/page]
160
(So that the affections of the lower
atmosphere in [underline]consequence[/underline] must tend
[underline]to equalise the temperature - Heat[/underline]
being generated, in one case, &
[underline]cold[/underline] in the other. - 
- Fluid by calculation from
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dalton's experiments on the heat
evolved, during the compression of
Air; that an increase of pressure
upon the lowest stratum equal to
that of an inch of mercury would
produce an increase of nearly three
degrees of temperatures, & an equal
diminution of pressure could occasion
an equal depression of temperature;
That is taking the mean pressure as
equal to 29 inches & half of mercury
in the Barometer & supposing the
Thermometer to stand at fifty five. -
Other circumstance being similar, a
change of density denoted by 30 inches

[page]48||dnp03b848pp|91026496[/page]
& half, ought to raise the temperature
to 58°, & a diminution to 28 inches
& half ought to lower it to 52°
- As I generally mentioned in
a former Lecture one of the great
causes of the precipitation of Moisture
from the atmosphere is the mixture
of hot & cold strata of air.-
Another [deletion]cause[/deletion] [insertion]source[/insertion] probably is the cold
produced by rarefaction in consequence
of the diminution of pressure, & as
the fall of the Barometer usually
demonstrates the apporach of rain, the
diminutions of pressure if the [underline]Cause;[/underline]
may well be the [underline]indication[/underline]. -
- In the great rains in stormy
weather from the South - This
source of moisture is probably in
continued operation - for the Barometer
usually indicates a considerable
rarefaction; & the currents of warm

[page]49||dnp03b849pp|91026497[/page]
161
air are continually tending to diminish
the pressure. - 
- [underline]The mists which rapidly form[/underline]
upon the sides of Mountains about
[underline]Sunset[/underline] seem often to have their
origin in the cold produced
by the rarefaction of an ascending
current of Air; (For as the latest
Sun beams fall on the tops of the
Mountains: there must be the
last ascending heated column of Air
& consequently the dense air will rise
from the bases & sides; will expand,
produce cold, & deposite, a light &
finely divided vapour. -
- These kinds of fleecy clouds are
usually very different from the [underline]Clouds[/underline]
[underline]which form in the bosom of vallies[/underline]
[underline]& over water on the approach of Night[/underline]
[underline]& during its continuance,[/underline] (& which

[page]50||dnp03b850pp|91026498[/page]
are composed of moisture precipitated
from the air, by the cooling agency
of water. - (The Vapours deposited
from the rarefaction of the dense
lower stratum of air, generally form
[underline]rapidly about the middle of the[/underline]
[underline]mountain as soon as it becomes[/underline]
[underline]shaded. - They are seldom circular[/underline]
[underline]in their form.[/underline] & surround the sides
like a belt. -
- The Clouds produced by the
cooling agency of water are generally
much denser. - They begin in the
lowest part of the valley & slowly
extend upwards, [underline]presenting[/underline] curved
& distinct outlines. -
- In the South of Ireland, in
the neighbourhood of the Lake
of Killarney, I several times
witnessed, (in the course of the
Summer of) both appearances. -

base of the mountain. - I shall shew
a rude sketch which I made. from
a drawing that I executed on the
spot of these effects as they appeared
upon the great Mountain Chruahan

are represented as they occurred after
Sunset. -

- The progress of the phenomena on this
occasion, proves the accuracy of the
conclusions - 
- The first appearance of Mist was
at about the middle of the Mountain
when the Sunbeams were departing
from it. This mist gradually extended
itself - at first of a Snowy whiteness
then orange. - then purple, & last of all
grey, as it reflected the different tints
of the western sky coloured by the last

[page]52||dnp03b852pp|91026500[/page]
refracted beams of light. - (As Night
approached it extended itself over the
summit & perfectly crested the Mountain.-
- The dense low Clouds did not
begin to appear till nearly a quarter
of an hour after Sunset & gradually
increased. Their tint was at first
purple inclined to grey; but as the
night approached they became white
& at length covered all the low lands -
So that nothing could be seen but the
upper parts of the mountains capped
by the higher clouds. -
- These evening Clouds that form
upon High lands in the driest & the
hottest Seasons supply at that time
the sources of Rivers, when they have
no other sources, & so prevent the
drying up of their streams & thus
preserve the Low lands from being

[page]53||dnp03b853pp|91026501[/page]
163
parched, & they are so described by
the Poet of the Seasons. -
[otherwork_237]"These roving mists that constant now begin[/otherwork_237]

"These the mountain cisterns fill,

(The phaenomena of the

adoption of the opinion
