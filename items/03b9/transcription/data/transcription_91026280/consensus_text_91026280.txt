of no Body capable of absorbing
the Nitrogene of Air without
affecting the [underline]Oxygene[/underline]; - But
there are certain substances
from which Oxygene after absorption
may be again disengaged
such for instance is [underline]Mercury[/underline]
which at a temperature of
600 combines with this part
[underline]of Air[/underline], but at a temperature
of 1200 is incapable of remaining
in union with it -
