lean toward the "idea" of a chemical combination
between the oxygene & [deletion]Hyd[/deletion] Nitrogene; |_but later
& more mature observation has altered
[underline]my notions[/underline] on the subject.-
-( It was supposed [insertion]at that time[/insertion] " that the Specific gravity
of Atmospherical Air was not a mean
between the specific gravities of the aeriform
substances composing it " which appeared
a demonstration of chemical union. But
it is now known "that this observation
[deletion]is erroneous[/deletion] was an error founded upon
[deletion]an error[/deletion] mistake [underline]in the[/underline] composition
of Air " which after the authority of
Lavoisier was considered as containing
28 per cent of oxygene."
- When oxygene, Nitrogene & Carbonic
Acid are mixed together in y[superscript]e[/superscript] due proportions
there is no change of volume, yet
they compose an elastic fluid having
all the [insertion]properties of Air[/insertion] |_There is [underline]no condensation[/underline] or
[underline]expansion[/underline] (when the carbonic acid & the
oxygene are separated [underline]from the Nitrogene[/underline]
of [underline]the common Atmosphere[/underline]; yet this ought
to happen [underline]if there was[/underline] any [underline]chemical[/underline]
union [underline]between[/underline] them.-
- Distilled water when agitated with Air
absorbs more of the oxygene than of the
Nitrogene; though if these bodies were chemically
combined it is scarcely possible that such an
affinity could separate them.
