- This Law has been always considered
as applying universally; |_but M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton
has attempted to shew " that its
operation is limited " |_ & that it governs
[deletion]only homogenous fluids[/deletion] elastic fluids only, " [underline]composed[/underline]
[underline]of[/underline] the same species of matter "- " ( Thus " He
supposes " that [underline]the particles[/underline] of the oxygene
[underline]in Air are[/underline] [underline]repulsive to each[/underline] other
but not to the particles of the Nitrogene
or carbonic Acid " & the same in
the other instances |_& He conceives that though
the different Gasses [insertion]though they[/insertion] do not [deletion]press upon[/deletion] [insertion]repel[/insertion] each

- |_This idea is certainly very ingenious

very ready explanation of the phaenomena.
- But there a number of [underline]facts[/underline] [underline]that oppose[/underline]
[underline]themselves[/underline] [underline]to it[/underline]. & in this case as
in many others it happens " that the labour
of much mathematical calculation & much
sagacity of observation are rendered unavailing
