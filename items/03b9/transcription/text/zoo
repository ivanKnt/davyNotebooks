Lecture 10[superscript]th[/superscript]
The former lectures of this Course
have been devoted to the Consideration of
those active powers which are the grand
Secondary Causes of the arrangement and
the Changes of [underline]the visible Universe.[/underline]--
|_Though the Agents are obscure and
mysterious, their [underline]effects[/underline] are obvious and
distinct - And the History of the phae-
-nomena of Nature will be more intel-
-lagible in Consequence of the examination
that has been made of these grand sources
of her [underline]Mechanism[/underline] and her [underline]Order[/underline].--
[underline]Heat Light and Electricity[/underline]
are substances, the existence of which
is [underline]inferred[/underline], rather than positively

intellect than [insertion]matters[/insertion] of Common Sensation. ~
The objects that are now to ocupy
our attention [insertion]on the contrary[/insertion] are familiar as general
Objects of Contemplation to all minds.
|_The Air the Sea & the Earth. The great
divisions of our globe, (in their infinite
[underline]diversity of forms[/underline]) are Continually, impr-
essed upon the [underline]eye, as connected with[/underline]
[underline]numerous wants and habits[/underline]; or infixed
in the memory as related to various
pleasures and pains; or they haunt
the imagination as [deletion]the[/deletion] Sources of the

-: It is in the Atmosphere, that
We [deletion]breathe &[/deletion] breathe & move: |_& health
& enjoyment & even Life itself
immediately depend upon its
peculiar constitution; the Subject
is almost equally connected
with the philosophy of Chemistry
& with the philosophy of common
life.
The Variations of Heat & Cold

[page]4||dnp03b904pp|91026260[/page]
The appearances of Meteors, of
thunder storms, of Mists
of rains of dews; the wonderful
varieties of [deletion]moving[/deletion] clouds, are
all [deletion]evident[/deletion] distinct demonstrations
of the constant alterations
taking place in the
aeriform Matter above us.
|_Late discoveries have develloped
the general Causes of their
most important Effects; "The
[deletion]Subject[/deletion] Subject is easily [deletion]intelligible[/deletion] made
intelligible; & admits of
Many experimental illustrations.
- The Air is that invisible

of the chemical apparatus under
all its [underline]different modifications[/underline]
-: Air, though so subtile & moveable
[deletion]subtile[/deletion] a Body is easily shewn
to have weight - A glass
globe such as this containing
100 cubic inches, " when exhausted
looses about 31 grains; as was
Shewn in the Course of pneumatics
by my friend M[superscript]r[/superscript] Allen.-
And in consequence of the elasticity
of Air, equal volumes taken
in free space weigh less in
proportion as the height is
greater - so that at 70
miles high Air weighs 300,000
times less - | that is [underline]is 300,000[/underline]
[underline]times rarer than[/underline] at the surface
& above 45[superscript]o[/superscript] high it is incapable
of exerting any [deletion]visible[/deletion] [insertion]sensible[/insertion] attractive
power on the rays of light
So as to occasion their refraction. - -

[page]6||dnp03b906pp|91026262[/page]
-|_The Atmosphere may be considered
as a great Elaboratory of
Nature in " which " a variety
of chemical operations are
constantly [deletion]in[/deletion] taking place -
|_Though simple & uniform
in appearance it is very
compound in its Nature,
(& it will be proper to
examine in detail, its
[underline]constituent parts[/underline], & their
especial operations.
- The substance which We
are most easily able to infer
the existence of [deletion]it[/deletion], in Air
is moisture, or some [deletion][unclear]precipitable[/unclear][/deletion] Matter
capable of assuming the [deletion]form[/deletion] [insertion]state[/insertion]
of Water.-
The rapid formation of a

dark cloud after a sultry morning
& the [deletion]fall of[/deletion] sudden fall of a shower.-
The deposition of [insertion]dew on[/insertion] a clear summers
evening when the Air, is [underline]still[/underline] &
[underline]transparent[/underline], [deletion]& still[/deletion]; [underline]are facts[/underline]
which most distinctly shew
the production [deletion]of[/deletion] of water
from the Atmosphere. -
When moisture disappears by
Evaporation; - [deletion]the process is merely[/deletion]
[deletion]a conversion of it into[/deletion] [insertion]or the process of drying - it[/insertion]
becomes elastic & invisible
in air. - And certain substances
[deletion]Bodies[/deletion] are capable of detaching
water from the Atmosphere
& of rendering it by their chemical
attractive powers again a fluid
Body. -
[underline]Instance[/underline] [underline]Muriate of Lime[/underline]
[deletion]Much discussion has taken [/deletion]
[deletion]place upon the Cause of[/deletion]
[deletion]the existence of Water in air[/deletion]

[page]8||dnp03b908pp|91026264[/page]
[deletion]in an elastic form.- It has[/deletion]
[deletion]been supposed to be merely[/deletion]
[deletion]in a [underline]state of mixture[/underline]; &[/deletion]
[deletion]it has [underline]likewise been conjectured[/underline][/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]supposed[/deletion] to be [deletion]as[/deletion] in chemical[/deletion]
[deletion]combination[/deletion].-

-The quantity of water in
Air is proportional to its
temperature-: Thus if Air
which has been fully saturated
with moisture at 40° has
its temperature raised to 80;
it will rapidly take up a
new [deletion]quantity of Water[/deletion][insertion]portion[/insertion]- &
if Water at 100° be
cooled to 50° it will immediately
deposit [deletion]The[/deletion]- moisture.

- It is not easy to ascertain the

[page]9||dnp03b909pp|91026265[/page]
170
precise quantity of moisture dissolved
in Air at different temperatures
"because in consequence of a
law of attraction mentioned
in the second lecture no
[underline]substance[/underline] has a sufficiently strong
attractive power for water to
detach it wholly from the
Air; |_but it seems probable
[underline]from various experiments[/underline] "that
[deletion]Water[/deletion] [underline]at 40° below nought[/underline]
[underline]A given portion of the atmosphere[/underline]
[underline]still contains from one 70[/underline] [deletion]to[/deletion] or 1/80 eightieth
of its weight; - "And at eighty
degrees it contains at least twice
[deletion]5 times[/deletion] as much as from [deletion]1/14 [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]

- The general circulation
of Water in the system
of our Globe, [underline]its ascent[/underline]

Air, its precipitation
in different forms, & its
return to its parent Source

by rivers & springs will
occupy our attention fully
in another part of the
Course.- "I am now considering
this material of the Atmosphere
only in its elastic state; &
in this state as well as
in the fluid form it
is constantly exerting most
important functions.-
[deletion]Plants in consequence[/deletion]
[deletion]of their living powers absorb[/deletion]
[deletion]-A certain [deletion][insertion]moderate[/insertion][/deletion] quantity of[/deletion]
[deletion]Moisture dissolved in Air[/deletion]
[deletion]is essential-[/deletion]
-The [underline]variations[/underline] in the
proportions of moisture in the
Air are essential to its
distribution over the surface of
the Earth; & Animals &

[page]11||dnp03b911pp|91026267[/page]
171
Vegetable structures are so
constituted as to bear
without injury [deletion]the important[/deletion]
[deletion]changes that are[/deletion]
all the common states of
Atmospherical saturation
-The air of the Northern
Climates in Winter which
contains [deletion]three or four[/deletion] [deletion][insertion]twice as little[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]times less[/deletion] [insertion]perhaps only half the quantity of[/insertion] moisture [deletion]there[/deletion]
that it holds dissolved
in summer has no
bad effect on the
constitution.- The Harmattan
which blows from the interior
of Africa & which is
said to be so dry that
it immediately absorbs the
moisture of all dead substances
which effects the wood of
furniture & occasions other
similar effects is considered
as a healthy wind; &
the Sirocco which blows over

[page]12||dnp03b912pp|91026268[/page]
the [underline]sea[/underline] to Sicily & which of
course must be comparatively
moist is oppressive from
its heat but far from
being injurious; though the
[deletion]brings[/deletion] air probably contains 1/[insertion]30[/insertion]
or 1/[insertion]40[/insertion] of its weight of water.
-|_As the degree of Saturation
of Air with moisture [deletion]has a[/deletion]
[deletion]considerable influence[/deletion] is immediately
[underline]connected with[/underline] [deletion]indications[/deletion]
[underline]the state of the weather[/underline],
many instruments have
been proposed, called Hygrometers
for measuring the degree of
saturation- |_Most of the
common Hygrometers are founded
upon the principle "that
various Bodies have their
Volumes enlarged by absorbing
moisture such particularly
are vegetable filaments &

[page]13||dnp03b913pp|91026269[/page]
172
animal substances-. In de
Saussures Hygrometer the expansions
or contractions of a [underline]hair[/underline] are
made the measures of changes
from dry to moist or from
moist to dry - In M. de
Luc's a thin piece of
Whale bone is employed.
- A very simple mode of
judging of the degree of
moisture in Air has been
proposed by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton. -
It is by mixing water at
the temperature of the
Atmosphere & [deletion]cool[/deletion] colder water
together; & ascertaining by
a thermometer at what degree
[deletion]temperature[/deletion] moisture begins
to be deposited upon the glass -
And in proportion as this
temperature is below the
temperature of the Air, so in
proportion is the Air dry.

[page]14||dnp03b914pp|91026270[/page]
- The [insertion]indications by this[/insertion] process seems to me
more susceptible of accuracy
than those afforded by the
[underline]Instruments[/underline], (which are much
more [underline]affected by particles[/underline]
of [underline]water[/underline] floating in the
Air as a finely divided
[underline]mist or vapour[underline]; than by
the truly elastic Water
[deletion]in the Air[/deletion]; - And
There are few cases in which
the lower strata of the
Atmosphere do not contain
[deletion]in some of p[/deletion] in some parts such
vapours - "It is indeed
exceedingly probable that
the colour of the Air
depends [deletion]upon y[superscript]e[/superscript] small particles[/deletion]
[deletion]of moisture[/deletion] upon them -
the constant changes of
temperature must be connected
with constant depositions of fluid

moisture, [deletion]so small[/deletion] which may be
so small in quantity as
to appear neither as mist
nor dew; |_& which nevertheless
may be capable of reflecting
light -
The Atmosphere appears almost white
or of a very light blue in
seasons or in climates where
the changes of temperature are
most [deletion]freq[/deletion] experienced |_& where
[deletion]constantly[/deletion] consequently |_there is the largest
proportion of [insertion]mechanical[/insertion] vapour [deletion]in[/deletion] if I may
be permitted so to call it) in
[underline]the air[/underline]. - - In the tropical
& equatorial climates where
the degree is most uniform
the [deletion]air[/deletion] tint [deletion]is[/deletion] of the sky is
of the deepest blue. -
- In mountainous districts
likewise in proportion to
the height " the floating moisture

[page]16||dnp03b916pp|91026272[/page]
diminishes in quantity &
the intensity of the shade
increases-. On the top
of Mount blanc [deletion]de Saussure[/deletion]
[deletion]states[/deletion] "where there was [deletion]no[/deletion] [insertion]little[/insertion]
vapour to reflect light
de Saussure "states that in the day
looking stedfastly upon the
sky it appeared of a
blue so deep as to
be scarcely distinguishable
from black; |_& [insertion]in the night in[/insertion] [deletion]the stars[/deletion]

& beauty. [deletion]so new & [unclear]pearl[/unclear][/deletion]
- The next elastic constituent
of Air [insertion]to be considered[/insertion] is [underline]Carbonic Acid[/underline]
or the [deletion]substance[/deletion] [insertion]gas[/insertion] anciently
called [underline]fixed Air[/underline]: - This
substance [insertion]elastic fluid[/insertion] is [deletion]usually[/deletion] found
in a quantity [deletion]still[/deletion] [insertion]much[/insertion] smaller

[page]17||dnp03b917pp|91026273[/page]
174
than the Water; & being elastic
at all [insertion]known[/insertion] temperatures & under
all [insertion]known[/insertion] pressures, its proportions
can only be made evident
by means of chemical combination
- If [underline]Lime water[/underline] be exposed
to air, a thin film soon
forms upon it; & this is
owing to the absorption of [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]the[/deletion] Carbonic acid [deletion]from the[/deletion]
[deletion]Air[/deletion] - [deletion]Instance[/deletion] [insertion]Instance[/insertion] Caustic alkali
by exposure to Air becomes
[underline]mild [deletion]likewise[/deletion] - from the[/underline]
same [deletion][insertion][unclear]xxxres[/unclear][/insertion][/deletion] cause. - And
Carbonic acid absorbed by
those bodies [deletion]becomes[/deletion] is again detached
by means of Vinegar or
acetous acid.

It then appears as an elastic
fluid - sour to the taste
absorbable by water.
Charcoal & oxygene, [underline]diamond[/underline]

[page]18||dnp03b918pp|91026274[/page]
Very different notions have been
formed with regard to the [underline]quantity[/underline]
of the Carbonic acid existing |
in air | It has by some
Chemists been rated as high
as 1/100 part & by others
as low as 1/1400 part"-
- I [deletion]find [insertion][deletion]have found[/deletion][/insertion] that the Carbonic[/deletion]
[deletion]acid contained in 600[/deletion]

[deletion]The question is not easily[/deletion]
[deletion]easily [insertion]capable of being correctly[/insertion] determined: for the[/deletion]
[deletion]proportions must necessarily[/deletion]
[deletion]be variable, [deletion]a shower of[/deletion] [insertion]continued[/insertion][/deletion]

[deletion]down a [deletion][unclear]great[/unclear][/deletion] part[/deletion]
[deletion]of this elastic fluid[/deletion]

[deletion]indication of 1/200 part whereas[/deletion]
[deletion]after a long continuance[/deletion]
[deletion]of wet weather it was[/deletion]
[deletion]difficult to perceive any[/deletion]
[deletion]less than [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] 1/500 part; &[/deletion]
[deletion]there are likewise many[/deletion]
[deletion]other causes of variation[/deletion]

[deletion][unclear]continuxxx[/unclear] of calm weather[/deletion]
- From [deletion]the most accurate[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion]
experiments [insertion]conducted with much care[/insertion] it would appear under
[insertion]common circumstances[/insertion] to be about 1/800 parts. -
[deletion]under [deletion]all[/deletion] common circumstances[/deletion]
-[deletion]For the quantity of Lime[/deletion]
[deletion]water required [deletion]to saturate[/deletion][/deletion]
I find that [deletion]a globe containing[/deletion] [insertion]the air confined[/insertion]
in a Globe [deletion]containing[/deletion] [insertion]of the capacity[/insertion] of 408
cubic inches is sufficient to
saturate 250 [deletion][unclear]x50[/unclear][/deletion] grains of
Lime water which require about
half a grain of Carbonic acid

[page]20||dnp03b920pp|91026276[/page]
- And from this Estimation,
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Daltons is not very
remote He calculates the
proportion at 1/1000.
-In general the "quantity has
been considered [deletion]as[/deletion] much too
high in consequence of
the imperfection of the [insertion]analytical[/insertion] methods
that have been employed-
alkaline solutions have been
agitated in long narrow tubes
over quicksilver; & the adhesion
of the water to the quicksilver
[insertion]& its disappearance[/insertion] during the process [deletion]has[/deletion]
occasioned an [deletion]much greater[/deletion]
[underline]apparent[/underline] [deletion]dep[/deletion] [underline][deletion]absorption[/deletion] loss[/underline]
[deletion]much[/deletion] greater than was
produced by absorption.-
[deletion]Carbonic acid[/deletion]
[deletion]Where[/deletion] - The Atmosphere at
all accessible heights still
contains its [deletion]due[/deletion] proportion
of this elastic substance

[page]21||dnp03b921pp|91026277[/page]

-Lime water [insertion]as we are informed by de Saussure[/insertion] soon exhibited the
[deletion]filament owing to[/deletion] pellicle owing to its absorption
upon the top of Mont Blanc
& Air brought down from
the upper regions of the atmosphere
[deletion]from a[/deletion] by means of Balloons

a similar relative quantity
to the Air on the surface,
- |_The Carbonic Acid though

operating in the oeconomy

by plants: & is one of
the sources of the [underline]charcoal[/underline]

-In consequence of its solubility
in Water it is carried

provided for the vegetable
world. --
- A quantity likewise is
renovated equal to that
consumed - In processes of
common combustion of
fermentation & of putrefaction
Carbonic acid is always
generated - And the
respiration of Animals
is a continued source
of its production;
|_& it is a beautiful circumstance
in physiology " that though
Carbonic acid in its pure
form, [deletion]or mixed with[/deletion] is
[deletion]non[/deletion] in the highest degree
deleterious to animal life.

innoxious when mixed with

& is in this state equally
[unclear]passive[/unclear] with [underline]the aqeous[/underline] vapour.
- |_Air after being deprived of
Carbonic Acid still retains all
its essential characters - Its
most important properties are
still the same " the great
Constituent parts [underline]Oxygene[/underline]
[underline]& Nitrogene[/underline] remain - There

acquire weight & will be
converted into an acid; This
is from the absorption of

part is the Nitrogene.-
Instance
- All combustible Bodies produce
a similar effect, but We know
of no Body capable of absorbing
the Nitrogene of Air without
affecting the [underline]Oxygene[/underline]; - But
there are certain substances
from which Oxygene after absorption
may be again disengaged
such for instance is [underline]Mercury[/underline]

that Oxygene alone was absorbed in

in about 24 hours.-
- Analogous results have been
gained by M Pfaff, D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Henderson & other experimenters, &
the fact may be [deletion]considered[/deletion] [insertion]regarded[/insertion] as
established. -
- On the ancient notion of

Atmosphere conceived that the uniformity

affinity & this opinion was [deletion][unclear]estim[/unclear][/deletion]
adopted by Humboldt, Morozzo & Berthollet
& has been advanced in the last Edition
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Thomsons Chemistry.-
- D[superscript]r[/superscript] Thomson has founded some of his
arguments upon [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] experiments that
I made on the Gasses in 1800 - which [insertion][deletion]there[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]seemed[/deletion]
[deletion]experiments at the time[/deletion] [deletion]to[/deletion] proved that
a gas [deletion]like[/deletion] precisely the same as
atmospherical air was evolved in some
instances of [deletion]chemical[/deletion] decomposition "
I confess (from [underline]the first[/underline] examination of
these facts) I was myself induced to

[page]42||dnp03b942pp|91026298[/page]
lean toward the "idea" of a chemical combination
between the oxygene & [deletion]Hyd[/deletion] Nitrogene; |_but later
& more mature observation has altered
[underline]my notions[/underline] on the subject.-
-( It was supposed [insertion]at that time[/insertion] " that the Specific gravity
of Atmospherical Air was not a mean
between the specific gravities of the aeriform
substances composing it " which appeared
a demonstration of chemical union. But
it is now known "that this observation
[deletion]is erroneous[/deletion] was an error founded upon
[deletion]an error[/deletion] mistake [underline]in the[/underline] composition
of Air " which after the authority of
Lavoisier was considered as containing
28 per cent of oxygene."
- When oxygene, Nitrogene & Carbonic
Acid are mixed together in y[superscript]e[/superscript] due proportions
there is no change of volume, yet
they compose an elastic fluid having
all the [insertion]properties of Air[/insertion] |_There is [underline]no condensation[/underline] or
[underline]expansion[/underline] (when the carbonic acid & the
oxygene are separated [underline]from the Nitrogene[/underline]
of [underline]the common Atmosphere[/underline]; yet this ought
to happen [underline]if there was[/underline] any [underline]chemical[/underline]
union [underline]between[/underline] them.-
- Distilled water when agitated with Air
absorbs more of the oxygene than of the
Nitrogene; though if these bodies were chemically
combined it is scarcely possible that such an
affinity could separate them.

A [underline]new Hypothesis[/underline] on the uniform constitution
of the Air has been lately brought

in Nicholson's Journal for Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 1801 &
has been since defended by the Author

[deletion]The elasticity of Air[/deletion] [deletion]The compressibility of[/deletion]
[deletion]Air evidently[/deletion] The density of Elastic fluids
as I have already mentioned is proportional
to the compressing force; [deletion]&[/deletion] on this proposition
it has been shewn that their particles

must repel each other with an [deletion]force[/deletion] [insertion]energy[/insertion] reciprocally
proportional to the distances of their centres -
[deletion]from each other.[/deletion]
- This Law has been always considered
as applying universally; |_but M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton
has attempted to shew " that its
operation is limited " |_ & that it governs
[deletion]only homogenous fluids[/deletion] elastic fluids only, " [underline]composed[/underline]
[underline]of[/underline] the same species of matter "- " ( Thus " He
supposes " that [underline]the particles[/underline] of the oxygene
[underline]in Air are[/underline] [underline]repulsive to each[/underline] other
but not to the particles of the Nitrogene
or carbonic Acid " & the same in
the other instances |_& He conceives that though
