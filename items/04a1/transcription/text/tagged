[underline]Introductory Lecture[/underline]
Though very great and important discoveries
have been made [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] the Science of [deletion]the[/deletion] Nature
[deletion]Earth[/deletion] - yet it is still too imperfect
to admit of any one [underline]great[/underline] - [underline]independent[/underline]
& [underline]general system[/underline]. - - " The [underline]constitution[/underline]
& the order, of the [underline]external[/underline] World
can only be understood - by a [underline]separate[/underline]
[underline]examination[/underline], & [underline]minute study[/underline] - of the
[underline]different [insertion]classes of[/insertion] objects[/underline] that compose it;
|_ and the knowledge of the harmony
& relation of the [underline]different parts[/underline],
is essential " for a comprehensive
view of the [underline]Mechanism of the[/underline]
[underline]whole[/underline]. -
- In proportion as the various
subjects of Human enquiry have
been separated from each other &
arranged in distinct departments. -"
so in proportion has accurate &
useful knowledge been more extended. -
"By the application of different minds
to different investigations: [deletion]t[/deletion] No exertions
of genius & labour have been [deletion]highly[/deletion] lost.

"& it has been found" - "That [deletion][insertion]very[/insertion][/deletion] minute
[underline]details[/underline] are necessary for the devellopment
of all [deletion]grand[/deletion] important & grand truths. -
-" These principles [deletion]are[/deletion] particularly
apply to [insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]Geology[/deletion] [insertion]subject of our consideration[/insertion] - ([underline]As[/underline] long "_as [underline]universal[/underline]

attempted by [underline]Philosophers[/underline] -" there was
scarcely a dawning of the true

Science :- " & the fancies of Men - were
substituted for the arrangements of

[underline]observation of a[/underline] few objects - "True

upon facts & experiments [insertion]& distinct analogies[/insertion] comformable to
the existing state of things
The Outlines of the Science are
plain & obvious: |_& they may be
made evident - even from [underline]common[/underline]
[underline]observation[/underline], from a superficial "view
of Nature.
The first impression received
from the exterior of the surface
of the globe" - is that of diversity
variety & beauty - |_ Hills & vallies
& plains appear covered with different
soils & affording different vegetables -
- Mountain chains are seen presenting
[deletion]&[/deletion] irregular summits, bare or capped with
[deletion]bare, or snow clad summits & their[/deletion]
snow or emitting volcanic fire: & their
foundations form the shores of
the Ocean - or the beds of
Rivers. -
Amongst the different Rocks
some [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]appear[/insertion] rapidly altered by the
agency of [deletion]Air & water[/deletion] [insertion]ye external [underline]elements[/underline][/insertion] - others,
resist in a great measure their
destructive effects. - [deletion]of these powerful[/deletion]
[deletion]elements[/deletion]. - [deletion]Here[/deletion] hard, [deletion]uniform[/deletion] &
Here. hard

[deletion]are[/deletion] Chrystalized in their texture
"& uniform in their appearances they
offer no vestiges of a prior
order of things -" but appear as
if in their 1[superscript]st[/superscript] created form -
- There more regularly disposed &
diversified in their aspect " they
present the vestiges of the remains
of organized bings " & [deletion]appear as[/deletion] stand as
monuments of the ancient revolutions
of our system.
-. The variety - the shades of
difference - seem almost infinite, -
yet [underline]their[/underline] relations, are capable
of becoming the objects [underline]of accurate[/underline]
[underline]Science[/underline] & there is a distinct
order [deletion]in[/deletion] & a systematic arrangement.
- The Rocks, of different
districts, where there is, a considerable
extent of surface are generally
found of the same species -
(Similar varieties; have similar associations,
in climates the most distant
|_ & they usually contain the same

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10401-000-00005|dnp04a105pp|88270836[/page]
metals & the same chrystalized subtances. -
- |_In their alterations by the agency
of Heat of Air & of Water these
are likewise analogous relations. - .
-. The effects of mountains upon
temperature, the [underline]decomposition[/underline] of
[underline]rocks[/underline], the [underline]formation of[/underline] soils &
the [underline]causes[/underline] of [underline]the[/underline] destruction &
[underline]renovation[/underline] of the [underline]solid land[/underline], are
[underline]all capable of explanation[/underline] upon
[underline]general[/underline] principles -" And in
the [underline]most obscure[/underline] "part of theory"
that part relating to the [deletion]production[/deletion]
first [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] effect of the[/deletion] changes of the globe."
though [deletion][insertion]there[/insertion] is[/deletion] an immense field [deletion]is [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
for particular speculation is open yet
there is little room for a diversity
of general Hypotheses. -
-The [deletion]objects[/deletion] [insertion]methods[/insertion] of study are
[deletion]little[/deletion] only in a small degree complicated -
[deletion]with each other[/deletion]: & the plan according
to which they ought to be
considered is evident from the
order of " the phaenomena "- Before
the laws of the alterations of the

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10401-000-00006|dnp04a106pp|88270837[/page]
surface can be understood " the objects
that compose it [insertion][deletion]should[/deletion][/insertion] must be examined
in their states of inactivity or of
rest": |_& " the knowledge of the
present [deletion]system[/deletion] oeconomy of the
system [deletion]must[/deletion] [insertion]should[/insertion] be acquired
before any conjectures are formed
of its past revolutions; or future
order. -
- In attempting " to unfold [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion]
illustrate the [deletion]principles[/deletion] Elements of  [deletion]the Science[/deletion] Geology
I shall [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] adhere to these
principles "- But before the [deletion]ab[/deletion] pure
& abstracted doctrines are considered "
I shall endeavor to prepare the way & render
[deletion]&[/deletion] smooth the path of investigation
by some general critical details
on the progress of the Science." -
- [deletion]In these details[/deletion] |_ the causes of
the failure or success of
the [deletion]different[/deletion] [insertion]various[/insertion] enquirers, [deletion]on the[/deletion]
[deletion]subject[/deletion] will be examined -
& the defects & the excellencie
of their [deletion]different[/deletion] systems discussed -

-- And [insertion]these details[/insertion] it may be hoped [deletion]that such[/deletion]
[deletion]details[/deletion] will [deletion]not only[/deletion] [insertion]not only[/insertion] [deletion]in[/deletion] "render the
general nature of the subject more
familiar to the mind " but will
likewise demonstrate the difference
between vague speculation & just
analogy, point out the methods
of discovery, & show " [underline]how truth[/underline] may
be [underline]attained[/underline].:
- After the Historical delineations - "
The arrangement of the [deletion]obje[/deletion] general
objects of the Science considered as
if permanent; will be examined -
The external characters & the chemical
Nature of Rocks [deletion]& stones[/deletion] " Their
connection as masses : & their intersection
by [deletion]metallic[/deletion] veins will be discussed.
& the different orders will be made
separate & distinct subjects of
investigation -
This part of the [deletion]subject[/deletion] [insertion]course[/insertion] I shall
illustrate as much as is in
my power by large specimens " &
by illuminated sketches of the natural
arrangements & positions of Rocks. -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10401-000-00008|dnp04a108pp|88270842[/page]
By this last method much useful
information " may I conceive, be conveyed."
- This screen has been arranged for
the purpose " a single instance
will show the nature of the
plan " - . The strong contrast
of light & shade is exceedingly
well adapted to exhibit the
forms & the aspects of rocks
& mountains & "the [deletion]connections[/deletion] [insertion]various[/insertion] junctions
or blendings of y[superscript]e[/superscript] strata "- All
the "subjects" of there paintings
will be new & the greater number
of them interesting objects of geology
in the British Islands. -
-.After having considered the existing
state of the Globe, -" the last subjects
of the Course will be "|_the the general
laws of its [underline]alterations[/underline], & the
causes of their harmony & [underline]subserviency[/underline]

the theories will be discussed"

which they have undergone in the
lapse of Ages & the principles &
order by which the whole is
continually preserved - It is
this department of the Science
[deletion]which will be the most useful[/deletion]

character - It is the one that
presents the greatest objects of
contemplation - It has most
employed [deletion]human ingenuity[/deletion] [insertion]philosophical talents[/insertion]; |_& many

brilliant examples of the [deletion][/deletion] most active
exertions of Genius.-.
-.."To those persons who [deletion]did me[/deletion] [insertion]attended[/insertion]
[deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] Geological Lectures delivered last
year "it will be evident" "that
nearly the same arrangement
was observed. - |_The order of the

there is an order in the position
of Rocks " by which certain species
are almost always found, accompanying
each other " & occupying the same
district -
In a mountainous country ("for
instance) if a rock of this
Nature occured 'which is serpentine
we might be almost certain that
this substance " which is " [chemical]chemical_269|soap[line]rock[/chemical] " would be somewhere found
in it & that this [deletion]substance[/deletion] [insertion]fossil[/insertion] which
is [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical] would not be

in vain to search for shell

- Again where [insertion]soft[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_184|Shell Limestone[/chemical]
occurs "there is a strong presumption
that soft black [chemical]chemical_397|shale[/chemical] or loose
[chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] will be found in some
contiguous spot " & in such a
country there is little doubt
that at some depth or in some

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10401-000-00030|dnp04a130pp|88270873[/page]
direction fossile coal would be discovered.
- |_These circumstances are fundamental
facts [underline]of[/underline] the Science "- " & [deletion]these[/deletion] the
ready [deletion]of[/deletion] application of them must
be immediately evident. -
- ""The Person who is digging

rock of acquainted with the

will be immediately instructed to

find a [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] a substance
which to an uninstructed eye

encouragement to proceed in his
researches " & a yellow or

sought for - For these strata
are generally immediately incumbent
on Coal. -
- Similar reasonings may be applied
to Metallic Veins
- The Metals seldom or never
occur in Rocks of Serpentine
of [chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical], or soft coaly [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical]
her in [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] nor in [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical];

hard [underline]shell[/underline] [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] -: |_And
if in [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] or [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] a
vein of white stone is found running
in a direction from East to West "
"there is much probability that in
some part of its depth " it may afford
useful metal - "|_And if Veins
of spar occur, in rocks, partly hollow
& partly filled with a yellow substance
of this Kind; which in [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place]
is called [chemical]chemical_399|Gossan[/chemical] " It may be
almost always concluded" that such

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10401-000-00032|dnp04a132pp|88270875[/page]
veins will be productive |_&
the larger the quantity of [chemical]chemical_399|Gossan[/chemical]
the better the indication."
- Some very great losses & failures
have often taken place in mining
from an ignorance of the [underline]directions[/underline]
in the common facts of [underline]geology[/underline]. -
- I shall mention a remarkable
instance that took place in
[place]place_160|Somersetshire[/place] -" Some Miners
from [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place] were employed
in working a rich [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] vein
near [place]place_302|Nether Stowey[/place]" - At a
certain depth the vein was
crossed by a dike of stone "
the miners cut in their accustomed
direction expecting immediately
to reach the vein " but their efforts
[deletion]labour was[/deletion] [insertion]were[/insertion] wholly unsuccessful
& it was not till after some
weeks & much expenditure of
money & labour that the
object was attained "

[page]33|MS-DAVY-10401-000-00033|dnp04a133pp|88270876[/page]

The reason of their failure was
that " [deletion]they had - [unclear]ern[/unclear] the primary[/deletion]
[deletion]country[/deletion] the arrangement of dikes
in the primary country of [place]place_021|cornwal[/place]
& in the secondary country of
[place]place_160|Somersetshire[/place] are very different "
in the one " the vein cut through
[deletion]the direction[/deletion] [insertion]almost[/insertion] always appears shifted," & in
the other it maintains its
perpendicular direction. - "&
the mere Knowledge of this fact
which is almost general for
the different districts would have
ensured the success of the [underline]operation[/underline]. -
-" A number of instances of the
same kind might be adduced " -
And the Science is equally applicable
in a number of other Arts
& professions -

studied by the [underline]engineer[/underline] who
is employed in the construction
of canals "or Docks" or fortifications

-. The Drainer "in order to

ought to be minutely acquainted
with the arrangement of the
Rocks in the district from
which the springs arise which
it is his business to divert"

attention to the nature &
