- The Primary & Secondary Rocks,
their transitions into, or relations to, each
other, & the different substances they
contain, are the first & most important
objects of study in Geological Science,
& they will be the first to occupy
our attention in this Couse of Lectures. -
- The variety, the shades of
difference seem almost infinite, yet
their relations are capable of becoming
the objects of distinct study. |_ The
Rocks of different districts where there
is a considerable extent of surface,
are generally found of the same species.
Similar varieties have similar assocations
in Climates the most distant, & the
chasms or veins they infold
usually contain the same metals, & the
same crystallized bodies. -
