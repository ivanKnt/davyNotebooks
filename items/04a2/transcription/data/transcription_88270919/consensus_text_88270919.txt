& great facts of Nature, rather
than her accidental combinations,
& curious irregularities. -
- To those who may wish to refer
to collections already formed &
arranged I am glad [deletion]that I am[/deletion]
[insertion]to be[/insertion] able to [deletion]state[/deletion] [insertion]recommend[/insertion] [deletion]that the Mineralogical[/deletion]
[deletion]department of the British Museum[/deletion]
[deletion]contains a number of excellent[/deletion]
[deletion]specimens, & that this noble[/deletion]
[deletion][insertion]public[/insertion] Establishment is now easily[/deletion]
[deletion]accessible to all students.[/deletion]
The Leskean collection of this
institution which is opened
to the public is a noble
spirit of liberality & which
is rendered more valuable from
the mineralogical lectures delivered
in it by my learned friend
the professor of mineralogy
