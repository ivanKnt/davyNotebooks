- In Studying the natural appearances
of Rocks, much curious information &
many valuable hints may be derived
from the [deletion]Study[/deletion] [insertion]examination[/insertion] of the descriptive writings
of Geological Travellers; & there
are many excellent works of this
kind developing correct views, &
Combining amusement with instruction. -
As a [deletion]Work[/deletion] [insertion]Book[/insertion] most [deletion]immediately[/deletion] relating [insertion]to[/insertion]
[deletion]to our own Country[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]the geology of the British Islands[/deletion] cases which are new to us[/insertion] I can with pleasure
recommend the "Mineralogy of the
Scottish Islands." by the Author
whom I just [insertion]now[/insertion] quoted , Professor Jameson. -
His descriptions are [deletion]conceived in the[/deletion]
[deletion]highest spirit of refinement of the[/deletion]
[deletion][person_267]Wernerian School[/person_267], & are[/deletion] executed
with correctness & address. -
I am able to bear testimony to the
accuracy of many of his statements,
& wherever he has studied
minutely, & with labour. He is
always ingenious & profound. -
