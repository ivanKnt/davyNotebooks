From what has been said of the
nature & methods of the Study [insertion]of Geology[/insertion] It is
evident that the accurate pursuit of it
must occupy a [deletion]considerable[/deletion] [insertion]certain[/insertion] portion of time
& demand some labour & attention. -
And a fair question may be asked,
What are its practical uses? What
advantages are likely to arise from it?
What interests will it promote?
- On this point, I might undoubtedly
shelter myself under the general
proposition, "that all knowledge is
highly beneficial" - That whatever
can awaken intellectual pleasure,
or convey more exalted views of
Nature, or of the human talents,
is truly worthy of our cultivation, &
fitted for our faculties. -
