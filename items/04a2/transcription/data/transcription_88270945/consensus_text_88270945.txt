- In a Mountainous country (for
instance) if a rock of this nature
occurred, which is [underline]serpentine[/underline], we might
be almost certain that this substance,
which is [underline]soap rock[/underline] would be
somewhere found in it, & that
this fossil which is micaceous Shist,
would not be far distant. - But
in such a position it would be
in vain to search for shell limestone
or Coal. -
- Again, where soft shell limestone
occurs, there is a strong presumption,
that soft black shale or loose sandstone
will be found in some contiguous
spot, & in such a Country there
is little doubt, that at some depth
or in some direction fossile coal
would be discovered. -
- - These circumstances are fundamental
facts of the Science - & the ready
