- - The person who is digging for pit
Coal, if he meets beneath the soil,
Serpentine or micaceous or granitic
rock, if acquainted with the arrangement
& nature of strata, will be immediately
instructed to give over his labour
& spare useless expence. - -
But should he find a Sandstone,
a substance which to an uninstructed
eye, appears of much the same
nature as Granite, it affords him
some encouragement to proceed in
his researches; & a yellow or
red ferruginous sandstone, or a fine
grained white sandstone, or soft
slate bearing impressions of vegetable
leaves, would offer very strong
indications of the substances sought for.
For these strata are generally
immediately incumbent on Coal. -
