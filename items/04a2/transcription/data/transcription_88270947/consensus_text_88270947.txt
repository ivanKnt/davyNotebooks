- Similar reasonings may be applied
to Metallic Veins. ---
- - The Metal seldom or never occurs
in Rocks of Serpentine, of Sienite, or soft
coaly Shist, nor in Sandstone, nor in
Basalts. . - But they may be [underline]looked[/underline]
for, in [underline]soft granite[/underline], in [underline]hard Shist,[/underline]
& in hard [underline]shell limestone[/underline]. - And if
in granite or Shist, a vein of white
stone is found, running in a direction
from East to West, there is much
probability, that in some part of its
depth, it may afford useful metal. -
And if Veins of Spar occur in rocks,
partly hollow & partly filled with a
yellow substance of this kind, which
in Cornwall is called Gossan, - It
may be almost always concluded,
that such veins will be productive,
& the larger quantity of Gossan, the
better the indication. - -
