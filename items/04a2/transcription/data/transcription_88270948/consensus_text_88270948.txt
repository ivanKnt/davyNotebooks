- Some very great losses & failures
have often taken place in Mining,
from an ignorance of the [underline]directors[/underline]
in the common facts of [underline]Geology[/underline]. -
- I shall mention a remarkable instance
that took place in Somersetshire. ---
Some Miners from Cornwall were
employed in working a rich copper
vein, near Nether Stowey. - At
a certain depth, the vein was
crossed by a dike of stone - The
Miners cut in their accustomed
direction, expecting immediately
to reach the vein, but their
efforts were wholly unsuccessful,
& it was not till after some
weeks & much expenditure of
Money & Labour, that the object
was attained. -
