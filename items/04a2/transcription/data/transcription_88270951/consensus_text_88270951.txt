their application, & the nearest places
whence they may be procured. - -
And lastly, - Even the Architect may
often benefit by this Science. - Of the
strata which afford stones employed in
Building - some parts are much more
liable to decay than others, & the
external Character, affords the
indication. - - Many rocks exceedingly
beautiful & tempting to the Eye, &
easily cut through, are often very
liable to decomposition, to be easily
destroyed by common natural agents;
And their relations to permanency can
only be known by Scientific Observation
- I can mention two remarkable cases
in which decomposing Stones have been
unfortunately employed in the construction
of considerable Edifices, which in
consequence are most rapidly falling
into decay. - The one is Chester
Cathedral, which is constructed of
