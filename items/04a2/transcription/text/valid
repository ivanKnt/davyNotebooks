Geology Lecture
1811
- So different are the exertions
of the faculties of the mind, & so
infinitely various the combinations of our
ideas;  [underline]that the same objects[/underline] may be
examined with the most opposite
views, & considered under many
diversified and beautiful relations. -
- - It is on this fact of our nature
so familiar to every understanding, that
the great extent and progression of Science
& Philosophy depend. - -
- Hence their division into various branches
& hence the distinctness & accuracy of the
different species of [underline]Knowledge[/underline]
- - The Planet that we inhabit may be
considered in its connection with the general
System of the Universe, as acted upon by
gravitation, , & revolving around the Sun. - -
It may be examined as the abode of

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00002|dnp04a202pp|88270889[/page]
organization & life, covered with vegetables
& peopled with animals; or it maybe
studied as composed of different inorganic
parts variously managed, & subservient
to different uses. - -
- - It is under this last point of view
that it is the subject of Geology. - The
word is derived from the [underline]Greek language[/underline]
it signifies the [underline]Science of the Earth[/underline];
but its acceptation is limited, & it is only
applied to the branch of knowledge
relating to the nature, position, &
changes of the bodies that compose
the [underline]known[/underline] parts of the surface
of the Globe. - -
- |_ The outlines of the Science
are plain & obvious & they may
be [deletion]made evident[/deletion] [insertion]illustrated[/insertion] even [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]by[/insertion] common
observation, from a superficial view
of Nature; - - I shall attempt
a delineation of them which [deletion]perhaps[/deletion] I hope will

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00003|dnp04a203pp|88270890[/page]
be found an appropriate introduction to the
study of the science & I shall point out the order
in which they will be considered in these lectures. -
The first impressions received from
the exterior of the Globe are those of
diversity, variety & beauty. - -
Hills, Valiles & Plains appear covered
with different soils & affording
different vegetables. Mountain
chains are seen presenting irregular
summits, bare or capped with
snow, or emitting volcanic fires,
& their foundations form, the beds
of rivers, or the shores of Lakes,
Seas & the Ocean. - -
- - In different Mountains &
Rocks there are two remarkable
distinctions of arrangement. -
|_ - Some are irregularly heaped together
in large masses, or layers which are
divided almost perpendicularly to the
surface . -
Others are arranged in bands or

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00004|dnp04a204pp|88270891[/page]
Strata, parallel or very slightly
inclined to the horizon. - -
The first consist for the most part
of Chrystalline stony matter, they
contain few fragments; and exhibit
few vestiges of a former order of things. -
These are called Primary Rocks. -
- - The second order usually contains
abundance of Mechanical deposited,
water worn stones, sand, & even clay
& they often abound in vegetable
remains, & the exuviae of marine
animals, These are called
the secondary Rocks. - - -
sketches
- Both these great Orders of Rocks
contain [deletion]Rocks[/deletion] Dykes or veins which
are more or less perpendicular &
which have been fissures or chasms
filled with different substances
embracing a variety of metallic ores

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00005|dnp04a205pp|88270892[/page]

- The Primary & Secondary Rocks,
their transitions into, or relations to, each
other, & the different substances they
contain, are the first & most important
objects of study in Geological Science,
& they will be the first to occupy
our attention in this Couse of Lectures. -
- The variety, the shades of
difference seem almost infinite, yet
their relations are capable of becoming
the objects of distinct study. |_ The
Rocks of different districts where there
is a considerable extent of surface,
are generally found of the same species.
Similar varieties have similar assocations
in Climates the most distant, & the
chasms or veins they infold
usually contain the same metals, & the
same crystallized bodies. -

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00006|dnp04a206pp|88270893[/page]
- . |_ The Arrangements of Rocks
& Mountains in Nature [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] &
of the minerals they contain
are admirably adapted to
the occurring of things, & these
arrangements will be pointed
out and discussed. - |_ The
[deletion]irregularity of the surface[/deletion]
[deletion]s[/deletion] Metallic ores so useful
in the Arts of life, which
would be noxious if distributed
over the surface of the Globe
are concealed within its bosom
where they revive to awaken & employ
Men in industry & ingenuity.
|_The [underline]irregularities[/underline] of the surface
so [underline]calculated to delight[/underline]
the eye, by their sublimity 
or their beauty, are absolutely
essential to the order of the
system. They diversify & equalize

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00007|dnp04a207pp|88270894[/page]
The temperature of the [deletion]surface[/deletion] earth
- The cooling agency of the highlands
is a cause of rain & vivifying
dews - [deletion]They modify the course[/deletion]
[deletion]of the winds[/deletion] the water raised in vapour
from the ocean, is condensed
on their summits, and flows in
springs & streams & rivers, to
produce vegetation & multiply
life, in y[superscript]e[/superscript] Vallies & plains.
After considering [deletion]in the first[/deletion]
[deletion]place[/deletion], the existing order of
things [deletion]the facts which[/deletion] in the forms which
at the moment appear permanent
the next step in the enquiry
will be the laws of their
alterations. -
|_ On this subject the human
powers are necessarily limited
We have as yet penetrated
to a small depth only below

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00008|dnp04a208pp|88270895[/page]
the surface; & there may be
an interior mechanism in
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]centre[/insertion] of which we have
no knowledge - The effects
of Heat, light, air &
water upon the surface
are almost the only circumstances
which we are capable of accurately
studying, & even with respect
to these our sphere of observation
is very small, |_ the works
of Ages cannot be judged
of except very imperfectly
by their effects in hours or
days, the laws of infinite
wisdom cannot be fully
estimated by finite intelligence
yet there is a glory in
the effort & delight &
instruction in the result.

- The Primary & Secondary Rocks
which form the known solid parts of our
Globe, undergo at their surfaces, a
continued series of changes. And
the causes of their decomposition are the
alterations of temperature to which
they are exposed, assisted by the
Chemical and mechanical agency of water,
& the attraction of their constituent parts
for principles contained in the atmosphere.
- Firm & immutable at their bases
In [insertion]in[/insertion] consequence [deletion]of Gravitation, Chemical[/deletion] [insertion]of Chemical & electrical agencies[/insertion]
[deletion][insertion]agencies[/insertion] attraction & the attraction of cohesion[/deletion]
the parts of our Mountains wherever
they are exposed to air & moisture,
lose their durability & their stony
texture & become subservient to
to the production & the renovation of
Soils. --
- - From the decomposition of a

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00010|dnp04a210pp|88270897[/page]
variety of Rocks, & from the mixture
of their elements by the agency of water
of streams & rivers - varieties of Earth,
result; fitted for all the different
modifications of [underline]vegetable Life. -[/underline]
In Plains - in vallies & on the low
hills of mountains, they support plenty
& trees subservient to the nourishment
& shelter of the superior animals,
& to the uses of Man. - On heights
where the larger plants are capable
of growing in consequence of the
intensity of the cold, or the force
of the blast, grasses are still
found, & vegetable life extends
its empire by means of mosses
& lichens, to the limits of perpetual
snow. -
-- When the [underline]effects[/underline] for which

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00011|dnp04a211pp|88270898[/page]
decomposition seems principally to operate
have been attained; The caused lose
their energy; & the [underline]surface[/underline] is in a
great measure defended by vegetation,
& by the vegetable earth, from any
new action of the elements, & novel
matter even is accumulated upon it
from [underline]water & air[/underline]; which at first,
were the principles of its decay. -
-- By the degradation of y[superscript]e[/superscript] surfaces of
Rocks fertile slopes are formed
where, before there were only barren
precipices. Lakes are filled up
the lower parts of the beds of rivers
[deletion]& a finely[/deletion] are diminished, & a finely
divided Earth is transported by the
mechanical agency of water, from bleak
or inaccessible mountains to supply
the waste of soil in cultivated vallies
& plains. -

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00012|dnp04a212pp|88270899[/page]
- |_ Amidst the changes, & circulation
of Matter, a [underline]certain quantity[/underline] of the
[underline]solid materials[/underline] of the Land is carried
[underline]into the Sea[/underline]; but in this [deletion][unclear]case[/unclear][/deletion]
circumstance, when fairly considered
there is [underline]no principle of general destruction,[/underline]
& there are a number of counterbalancing
agencies. - -
- - Low islands are forming or are
constantly increasing at the mouths
of great rivers, from the mixture
of the materials of the land, with
those of the Sea, & from the opposing
agencies of the tide & the Stream. -
- Coral rocks are continually forming
in the great extent of the ocean,
& they are already the bases of
many fertile islands in the Pacific. -
And subterraneous & submarine

fires are active in elevating or extending
Land - |_ So that the principle of Change
seems essential in all terrestrial nature;
but by the [underline]equilibrium[/underline] of powers, by
the coincidence of effects, the System
continues the same. - And the
Order by which the Globe is preserved
fitted for the purposes of life, appears
as fixed & unalterable as that
which ensures the [underline]reproduction[/underline] &
[underline]continuance[/underline] of the tribes of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]living beings[/insertion]
Beings [insertion]which are its inhabitants. -[/insertion] [deletion]that inhabit it[/deletion]. - -
- |_ We are carried by anticipation
from the present to the future
& the [deletion]mind is equal[/deletion] imagination is equally
active with respect to the
past. - In considering the
Phaenomena of Geology it is
impossible to avoid conjecture
concerning the prior alterations of

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00014|dnp04a214pp|88270901[/page]
The [deletion]Gol[/deletion] Globe. - The productions
of the sea are found imbedded
in high mountains.. -  " |_ The
whole [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] of [insertion]y [superscript]e[/superscript][/insertion] surface appeals
to us in the intelligible
language of the Roman
poet which may be thus
translated "
Remains that to the waters owe their birth
Occur in Rocks beneath the solid earth
Where our rich fields their varied face display
Once in proud triumph flowed the azure sea
And in the change of things & lapse of time
The conquering waves have found another clime
And where another land it[insertion]s[/insertion] verdure spread
Is now the moving oceans tranquil bed.
- But on what great causes have
these wonderful changes depended
By what Laws or according to
what principles have they been
produced [insertion]?[/insertion] - This enquiry
is a most [underline]interesting[/underline]
I may say a [underline]most sublime[/underline]

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00015|dnp04a215pp|88270902[/page]
[underline]part[/underline] of Geology. - It generally
occupies the first place in
systematic works. -- I shall
treat of it in the last place
in these lectures; - because it
will always be a hypothetical
[deletion]subject[/deletion] [insertion]investigation[/insertion]. It cannot be
in any way made a series
of facts; Its foundations must
be probable analogies. -
- The most striking & brilliant
view of the subject is that
which was developed in its
first form by the genius of
Hooke & which has ripened
into what is usually called
the Platonic Theory. -
- In this theory All the
phenomena of Geology are
supposed the result of an
uniform system in which there

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00016|dnp04a216pp|88270903[/page]
has been no derangement; but
one constant order. -
- The Land it is said is
continually degrading & decomposing
by the agency of water; &
in the course of [insertion]cycles of[/insertion] ages must be
entirely destroyed. But there
is an antagonist power of
renovation [underline]fire[/underline]: which acting
beneath the bottom of the
sea is continually raising
land; from which continents
& islands result. - -
-: |_Our rocks are chrystaline
or consolidated: |_ & must say
the advocates for this opinion
have been once fluid or
soft; & fire is the only
agent adequate to such
an effect; which acting
under the pressure of the
ocean must produce [deletion]effects[/deletion] [insertion]results[/insertion]

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00017|dnp04a217pp|88270904[/page]
5
. . very different from those which
it occasions in the free
Atmosphere. -
According to the platonic notion
All our Rocks have been formerly
the materials of another land;
& the organic remains they contain
are considered as so many
proofs of this circumstance.
In this system decay and renovation
are conceived to be perfectly
balanced; - water degrades. Fire
[deletion]renovates[/deletion] [insertion]reproduces[/insertion] & they are [deletion]conceived[/deletion] [insertion]imagined to be[/insertion]
opposed to each other like the
[deletion]good &[/deletion] [insertion]evil & good[/insertion] principles of the
Persian Mythology [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] &
Arhrimanes & Ormuz, the
Destroying & creative genie. - -
- From what I said a few
minutes ago it is evident

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00018|dnp04a218pp|88270905[/page]
that in referring to the
actual changes now taking
place upon the globe. we
must, admit the operations
of causes similar to those
adopted in the platonic
hypothesis; - but it is
a matter of doubt &
of discussion whether they
must be admitted, are universal
- The great difficulty opposed
to [insertion]y[superscript]e[/superscript][/insertion] igneous theory was the
source of Heat: - But [deletion]as[/deletion]
[deletion]mentioned in the chemical[/deletion]
[deletion]lectures[/deletion] This may be accounted
for by supposing the interior
of the globe composed of the
metals of the earths, which
the agency of air & water
might cause to turn into
Rocks. "& even the
reproduction of these metals

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00019|dnp04a219pp|88270906[/page]
may be conceived to depend upon
electrical polarities in the
earth. - & in this manner
an harmonious order may be
assumed. but [insertion]though [deletion]the[/deletion] [unclear]their are[/unclear] idea [insertion]is one[/insertion] which I have[/insertion] [deletion]it rests on[/deletion]
pure [insertion]myself ventured to throw out, I cannot avoid saying that it rests on pure[/insertion] speculation; - It does
not command our assent, nor
has it [insertion]for me[/insertion] that high degree of
probability which [deletion]induces[/deletion] necessarily
[deletion]our feelings of[/deletion] [insertion]induces[/insertion] conviction. -
- . The view which is particularly
opposed to the platonic is the
neptunian; & [deletion]which[/deletion] it is sanctioned
by the Authority of [deletion]Kirwan[/deletion], Werner
[insertion]Kirwan[/insertion] & de Luc. - In this Hypothesis.
It is conceived that all Rocks
are depositions or chrystalizations
from [deletion]a[/deletion] solution in an aqueous
menstruum; & that the secondary
Rocks were the latest despositions
being formed after the ocean was
peopled with living beings. - [deletion]In this[/deletion]

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00020|dnp04a220pp|88270907[/page]
-. No order is conceived [deletion]according to[/deletion]
corresponding to the existing order
of things. - The whole system
is founded upon the solvent powers
of water. - .. [insertion]& it is a[/insertion] [deletion]The[/deletion] speculation
[deletion]is principally[/deletion] [insertion]very rem[/insertion] remarkable for[insertion]from[/insertion]
its simplicity [deletion]but is distinguished[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]it does not seem to me to be[/deletion][/insertion]
[deletion]neither by [insertion]its[/insertion] [insertion][deletion]magnificence[/deletion][/insertion] harmony with facts[/deletion]
[deletion]nor by sublimity nor beauty. -[/deletion]
-. Besides the platonic hypothesis [deletion]of[/deletion]
[insertion]which considers[/insertion] Rocks as the result of an existing
order & the neptunian which
regards them as products of
a slow process of creation & deposition
from a chaotic fluid; |_ there are
other views -"  in which the
present state of things, [deletion]are[/deletion] is supposed
to have resulted from a great
& extraordinary [deletion]event[/deletion] series of events
[deletion]So different are the faculties[/deletion]
by which the ocean was carried
over the land; & the secondary

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00021|dnp04a221pp|88270908[/page]

Rocks deposited upon the primary
ones. - . Leibnitz & Whiston [insertion]Whiston[/insertion]
refer this [deletion]great[/deletion] [underline]revolution[/underline] to
the agency of a comet by
which the tides were raised
above the mountains & carried
round the earth; & by which
the water was heated so
as to gain new solvent powers;
& they connect this [deletion]effect[/deletion] [insertion]event[/insertion] with
the sacred & profane history
of early times - .
- |_In [deletion]describing[/deletion] [insertion]examining[/insertion] these different views
I shall endeavor to discuss the evidences
on which the[insertion]y[/insertion] rest & to estimate
the degree of probability of the
different [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion]arguments[/insertion] brought forward
to support them. |_ On such a
subject [underline]doubt[/underline] is not merely
excusable; it is in fact salutary.
- It is only [deletion]by[/deletion] by [deletion]chemical agencies[/deletion] reasoning upon

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00022|# HD_4_A_2_22.tif|[/page]
the operations of Chemistry that
be can hope to gain any
just theory of the formation
of Rocks; & Chemistry is
every day gaining new instruments
& exhibiting to us new substance
& powers: - And the perfection
of this science cannot fail
to enlarge our views of the
grand operations of Nature. -
-|_ The most active imagination
must rest somewhere - There is
some point in which even
a circle must be begun. -
And all the evidence deduced
from the face of Nature
would incline mw to believe
taht the [insertion]beginning of the[/insertion] existing order of things
cannot be placed farther
back than the period attributed

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00023|dnp04a223pp|88270910[/page]
to it in the sacred writings |_ &
it is this order only which it
is in our power accurately
to study. -
- |_ In this order the two
grand circumstances are [underline]"[/underline] 1[superscript]st[/superscript]
that the secondary Rocks
have been materially altered
by causes acting from above. - [Horizontal rule]
|_Strata have been swept away

& yet the parallelism of

They are irregular their layers

no distinct parallelism. - - 
- |_ It seems absolutely necessary to
introduce more than one system
of causes for the changes that
have taken place. - Fire renders

fluid, |_ but it increases the solvent
powers of water to a wonderful
extent ; & [deletion]all the[/deletion] all substances
possessed of chemical action on
each other have their energies
exalted by heat. - . . It
has been too much the
fashion in Philosophy to
refer [deletion]to sin[/deletion] operations & effects
to single agencies: But there
are in fact in Nature
two grand species of relationship
between phaenomena - In one,

[page]25|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00025|dnp04a225pp|88270912[/page]
7
- [deletion]In Nature there are two grand[/deletion]
[deletion]species of relation, between phenomena[/deletion];
- In one, an infinite variety of effects
is produced by [deletion]one[/deletion] [insertion]a single[/insertion] cause. - In the
other, - a great variety of causes is
subservient to one effect. - both
are equally [deletion]sublime[/deletion] [insertion]important[/insertion] & equally
worthy of being studied; |_ though
the last has been least attended to,
as the enquiry is more laborious;
& the results less attainable. -
Instances of it, may however, every
where be found. [insertion][deletion]as[/deletion] parallel to[/insertion] [deletion]It prevails generally,[/deletion]
those in Geology.
[deletion]and the most important series of events[/deletion]
[deletion]belonging to the external Universe[/deletion]
[deletion]arise in all their extent & efficacy,[/deletion]
[deletion]from many diversified combinations.[/deletion]
- A [underline]variety of rays[/underline] co-operate,
to produce the simple sensation of
pure light. - - -

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00026|dnp04a226pp|88270913[/page]
- The numerous gravitating agencies
of the planets & their satellites upon
each other, & upon the Sun, produce
the simple effect of regular, harmonious,
& invariable revolutions. - 
- The functions of animal bodies
are supported by various nourishment,
& by various Setts of organs; And
almost all the principles of Matter
in their various combinations are
made essential to the existence
& the pleasures of one being. -
In these things there is the nicest
adaptation. -  An Order calculated
to awaken the strongest admiration. -
|_ We ought never to judge of [underline]Nature[/underline]
by the [underline]Generalizations[/underline] which arise
in our [underline]own fancy[/underline]. - We are
compelled to seek for [underline]simplicity[/underline]
on account of the weakness of our

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00027|dnp04a227pp|88270914[/page]
[underline]own powers[/underline]. - We are incapable
of giving perfection & utility to complicated
Machines, & we are generally most
impressed by that which approaches
nearest to, - which most resembles
the best of our own productions. -
- But Man is [deletion]but[/deletion] merely the [underline]imitator[/underline],
the [underline]Servant[/underline] & [underline]interpreter[/underline] of Nature -
He [underline]labours[/underline] in vain when he attempts
to reason concerning the ultimate
tendency of [underline]Her[/underline] works, from that
of his own. - He is the Slave
of time; Her operations are in
Eternity. - & [deletion]the most sublime[/deletion] [insertion]high[/insertion]
faculties are required to catch even
a [underline]glimpse[/underline] of the wise & wonderful
laws, by which they are [underline]governed[/underline].

[underline]Now[/underline]
With y[superscript]e[/superscript] critical  examination
of the speculations & hypotheses on
Geology I shall conclude the
Cours . - I shall spare
no labour I shall employ
all my [deletion]little[/deletion] feeble powers to
make the subject of it
intelligible & useful, but [underline]lectures[/underline]
even in their best & most popular form
even when they most awaken interest,
& arrest the attention, are wholly
inadequate to fix in the Mind, the
principles & basis of Science. -
They may sometimes indeed in this
case, excite the uninformed [deletion]mind[/deletion] to
Enquiry, & communicate general views,
but they can be subservient to useful &
extensive knowledge only, when [insertion]assisted[/insertion] by [deletion]a[/deletion]

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00030|dnp04a230pp|88270917[/page]
[underline]previous, or collateral[/underline] Study
of the Subject to which they
relate. - - -
- - It is for this reason, that I
I take the liberty of urging to
those of my audience to whom
the Science of Geology is as yet
new, & who may really wish to
become acquainted with it as
Students, the necessity of
acquiring particular information
by the examination of specimens
& by a course of reading. -
- It is not necessary in the
Study of mineral bodies in a
Geological point of view, to enter
at once upon the consideration

[page]31|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00031|dnp04a231pp|88270918[/page]
of the whole extent of the fossile
productions of the Earth. - -
- The principal Rocks which form
the great foundations of the Surface
are comparatively few in number,
& may be very easily procured,
& at an inconsiderable expence. -
The large sums of Money which are [insertion]often[/insertion] laid
out in Cabinets, are usually devoted
to the collection of rare & uncommon
Minerals. - but these substances,
though greatly interesting to the
Mineralogist & Chemist, are
comparatively of little importance
to the Geologist, whose object
is to study the usual productions,

[page]32|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00032|dnp04a232pp|88270919[/page]
& great facts of Nature, rather
than her accidental combinations,
& curious irregularities. -
- To those who may wish to refer
to collections already formed &
arranged I am glad [deletion]that I am[/deletion]
[insertion]to be[/insertion] able to [deletion]state[/deletion] [insertion]recommend[/insertion] [deletion]that the Mineralogical[/deletion]
[deletion]department of the British Museum[/deletion]
[deletion]contains a number of excellent[/deletion]
[deletion]specimens, & that this noble[/deletion]
[deletion][insertion]public[/insertion] Establishment is now easily[/deletion]
[deletion]accessible to all students.[/deletion]
The Leskean collection of this
institution which is opened
to the public is a noble
spirit of liberality & which
is rendered more valuable from
the mineralogical lectures delivered

[deletion]there is an admirable view of the[/deletion]
[deletion]Natural Orders & arrangements of[/deletion]
[deletion]Rocks , founded upon the System[/deletion]
[deletion]of Werner. I could only have[/deletion]

[deletion]that [insertion]I believe[/insertion] he is [insertion]sometimes[/insertion] too much admired [insertion]or rather to implicitly followed[/insertion] as a[/deletion]
[deletion]Master. - [/deletion]
[deletion]- - The knowledge of the external[/deletion]
[deletion]properties of the Common Rocks, considered[/deletion]
[deletion]as fragments, is a necessary introduction[/deletion]

[page]40|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00040|dnp04a240pp|88270930[/page]
to the Study of the Earth. - But it

Mineralogy ought merely to be a preparation

that it is in the great arrangements
of [underline]Nature[/underline], & not in the details
of the Museum that the facts
& the foundations of the Science
must be sought for & examined. -
- The study of the natural arrangements
of Rocks, may at first view appear
a very difficult & extensive labour
& to some persons an impracticable one. -
- But to gain a general
acquaintance with the subject, it is
not necessary to examine a great
variety of districts, or a great extent
of Country. -

I am able to bear testimony to the

minutely, & with labour. He is
always ingenious & profound. -

- Amongst the works which relate to
[underline]foreign[/underline] Countries. - It is unnecessary to
dwell upon those of Humboldt. They
have been recently brought forward
in our most popular journals & their
merits ably & [deletion]eloquently[/deletion] displayed .
The publications of Dolomieu likewise
occupy a [underline]distinguished rank[/underline]. This
celebrated Man was possessed of the
true love of Geology & was guided
in his researches by the most
philosophical Spirit . - His writings
particularly those on the Islands
of the Meiterranean are distinguished,
not merely by accuracy of description
but likewise by a peculiar justness
of thought, & happiness of deduction. -
- He is not a rapid Traveller who has
merely sketched the outlines of objects,
but he has studied them [underline]deeply[/underline],

[page]44|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00044|dnp04a244pp|88270934[/page]
& examined their minute parts,
their bearings & relations, & his
pictures are equally valuable
for their accuracy & their strength.-
- - Of a kindred Character are
the publications of [underline]"De Saussure"[/underline] -
Educated amidst the magnificent
Scenery of the Alps - this illustrious
person, felt in his earliest days,
the warmest admiration of the [underline]Study[/underline];
& his [underline]whole life[/underline], was more or less
devoted to it . - - Possessing from
Nature, a [underline]penetrating Genius[/underline] - he
assisted its efforts by all the refinements
& resources of [deletion][unclear]Act[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Science[/insertion]. - In his researches
he spared no labour, & yielded
nothing to the common sentiment
of self love. -
- A constant inhabitant of the
Mountains, he has exceeded all
other writers, in his descriptions of them . -

& this [deletion]aimiable[/deletion] [insertion]excellent[/insertion] & learned
Philosopher has employed all
his talents to support
what He conceives an orthodox
system of the Earth & to
overturn the plutonic heresy.
- . M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Luc has lately
published a work of a kindred
Character which demonstrates
equally the vigour of his
mind & the powers of his
[deletion]per[/deletion] body.-. The ardour of this
Veteran in Science for the

[page]48|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00048|dnp04a248pp|88270938[/page]
pursuit of knowledge seems
to increase with his age.
I cannot [insertion]always[/insertion] agree with him
in opinion; but I admire
the spirit with with He
pursues His subject & the
unsubdued energies of his
[deletion]mind[/deletion]. imagination.
- The best view of the plutonic

character of a confused effort
of gigantic but ill directed
power. It becomes impressive
from its simplicity & [insertion]seductive from[/insertion] its elegance.
& is rich in [deletion]w[/deletion] instances of
noble philosophical eloquence. -
[deletion]Sir James Hall has given[/deletion]
[deletion]to this theory, the weight[/deletion]
[deletion]of important & original experiments[/deletion]
[deletion]- which [underline]illustrate[/underline] in the most[/deletion]

From what has been said of the
nature & methods of the Study [insertion]of Geology[/insertion] It is
evident that the accurate pursuit of it
must occupy a [deletion]considerable[/deletion] [insertion]certain[/insertion] portion of time
& demand some labour & attention. -
And a fair question may be asked,
What are its practical uses? What
advantages are likely to arise from it?
What interests will it promote?
- On this point, I might undoubtedly
shelter myself under the general
proposition, "that all knowledge is
highly beneficial" - That whatever
can awaken intellectual pleasure,
or convey more exalted views of
Nature, or of the human talents,
is truly worthy of our cultivation, &
fitted for our faculties. -

[page]52|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00052|dnp04a252pp|88270942[/page]
(blank page)

[page]53|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00053|dnp04a253pp|88270943[/page]
But independent of such considerations
must occupy a [deletion]considerable[/deletion] [insertion]certain[/insertion] portion of time
an useful Science, I may fairly say
that [underline]Geology[/underline] is exceedingly worthy of
being cultivated. - And a few
details will be sufficient to prove,
that the information to be derived from
it, is often applicable to important
purposes, & may in a number of
instances be made subservient to the
wants of Life. -
- Fixed [deletion]up[/deletion]on the Earth & dependent
for our support & existence upon the
various objects surrounding us, many
of our necessities are supplied &

[page]54|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00054|dnp04a254pp|88270944[/page]
some of our highest comforts produced
by the application of substances
found in the Mineral Kingdom. -
- The [underline]Soils[/underline] from which our
vegetable nourishment is raised;
The Stones of which our habitations
are formed, the fuel we employ
for so many purposes, & the metals
so absolutely essential to civilized
Man - [deletion]it is evident[/deletion] are all
objects of Geology - And as this
Science treats of their nature,
arrangement & association, it is
evidently the most capable of
affording useful discoveries, with
regard to their localities, occurrence
& [deletion]most useful[/deletion] [insertion]readiest[/insertion] application. -
- - I have already mentioned that
there is an order in the position
of Rocks, by which certain species
are almost always found, accompanying
each other, & occupying the same district. -

[page]55|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00055|dnp04a255pp|88270945[/page]

X
- In a Mountainous country (for
instance) if a rock of this nature
occurred, which is [underline]serpentine[/underline], we might
be almost certain that this substance,
which is [underline]soap rock[/underline] would be
somewhere found in it, & that
this fossil which is micaceous Shist,
would not be far distant. - But
in such a position it would be
in vain to search for shell limestone
or Coal. -
- Again, where soft shell limestone
occurs, there is a strong presumption,
that soft black shale or loose sandstone
will be found in some contiguous
spot, & in such a Country there
is little doubt, that at some depth
or in some direction fossile coal
would be discovered. -
- - These circumstances are fundamental
facts of the Science - & the ready

[page]56|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00056|dnp04a256pp|88270946[/page]
application of them must be immediately
evident. - - -
- - The person who is digging for pit
Coal, if he meets beneath the soil,
Serpentine or micaceous or granitic
rock, if acquainted with the arrangement
& nature of strata, will be immediately
instructed to give over his labour
& spare useless expence. - -
But should he find a Sandstone,
a substance which to an uninstructed
eye, appears of much the same
nature as Granite, it affords him
some encouragement to proceed in
his researches; & a yellow or
red ferruginous sandstone, or a fine
grained white sandstone, or soft
slate bearing impressions of vegetable
leaves, would offer very strong
indications of the substances sought for.
For these strata are generally
immediately incumbent on Coal. -

[page]57|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00057|dnp04a257pp|88270947[/page]
- Similar reasonings may be applied
to Metallic Veins. ---
- - The Metal seldom or never occurs
in Rocks of Serpentine, of Sienite, or soft
coaly Shist, nor in Sandstone, nor in
Basalts. . - But they may be [underline]looked[/underline]
for, in [underline]soft granite[/underline], in [underline]hard Shist,[/underline]
& in hard [underline]shell limestone[/underline]. - And if
in granite or Shist, a vein of white
stone is found, running in a direction
from East to West, there is much
probability, that in some part of its
depth, it may afford useful metal. -
And if Veins of Spar occur in rocks,
partly hollow & partly filled with a
yellow substance of this kind, which
in Cornwall is called Gossan, - It
may be almost always concluded,
that such veins will be productive,
& the larger quantity of Gossan, the
better the indication. - -

[page]58|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00058|dnp04a258pp|88270948[/page]
- Some very great losses & failures
have often taken place in Mining,
from an ignorance of the [underline]directors[/underline]
in the common facts of [underline]Geology[/underline]. -
- I shall mention a remarkable instance
that took place in Somersetshire. ---
Some Miners from Cornwall were
employed in working a rich copper
vein, near Nether Stowey. - At
a certain depth, the vein was
crossed by a dike of stone - The
Miners cut in their accustomed
direction, expecting immediately
to reach the vein, but their
efforts were wholly unsuccessful,
& it was not till after some
weeks & much expenditure of
Money & Labour, that the object
was attained. -

[page]59|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00059|dnp04a259pp|88270949[/page]
16
- The reason of their failure was
that the arrangement of dikes in the
Primary Country of Cornwall, & in the
Secondary Country of Somersetshire, are very
different. - In the one, the vein cut
through, almost always appears shifted,
& in the other, it maintains its
perpendicular direction. - And the
mere knowledge of this fact, which is
almost general for the different districts,
would have insured the success of the
operation. -
--- A number of instances of the
same kind might be adduced. - /_ And
the Science is equally applicable in
a number of other Arts & Professions. -
- It ought to be particularly studied
by the [underline]Engineer[/underline], who is employed
in the construction of Canals, or Docks,
or Fortifications, as certain strata
exceedingly hard, often alternate

[page]60|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00060|dnp04a260pp|88270950[/page]
with others that are very soft & easily
cut through, & by a knowledge of their
different positions & relations, much
unnecessary labour & expence may
be often avoided. -
- - The Drainer, in order to make
his [underline]operations[/underline] successful, ought to
be minutely acquainted with the
arrangement of the Rocks, in the
district from which the springs arise,
which it is his business to divert,
& he ought to pay particular attention
to the nature & position of [underline]dikes[/underline],
for they often intersect soft strata,
& stop the course of the water,
& render all his operations useless,
till they are discovered & penetrated. -
- The Farmer & the Improver of Land
even, may often derive from Geology
very useful instruction with regard
to the position of Limestone, Marle & Clays,

[page]61|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00061|dnp04a261pp|88270951[/page]
their application, & the nearest places
whence they may be procured. - -
And lastly, - Even the Architect may
often benefit by this Science. - Of the
strata which afford stones employed in
Building - some parts are much more
liable to decay than others, & the
external Character, affords the
indication. - - Many rocks exceedingly
beautiful & tempting to the Eye, &
easily cut through, are often very
liable to decomposition, to be easily
destroyed by common natural agents;
And their relations to permanency can
only be known by Scientific Observation
- I can mention two remarkable cases
in which decomposing Stones have been
unfortunately employed in the construction
of considerable Edifices, which in
consequence are most rapidly falling
into decay. - The one is Chester
Cathedral, which is constructed of

ferruginous sandstone & by the
action of water & air, all the
exterior ornaments, & nearly a half
of the surface of this venerable
Structure are destroyed. -
- The other, is the Library of Trinity
College, Dublin, which must have
been a most beautiful building
but which from decomposition is rapidly
losing all its elegance of Architecture,
& the circumstance is the more singular,
as the principal rocks in the
neighbourhood are beautiful &
permanent granites - & by some
unfortunate circumstance, the
materials selected for this edifice
must have been brought from
some distance & probably at a
great expence. ---

Indeed
[deletion]&[/deletion] there is no city in Europe more happily
situated in this respect than Dublin.
Its position is such that were a geological
academy to be established it could
not be fixed in a more advantageous
spot - The mountains around us
contain all the varieties of the
Primary rocks; the strata beneath our
feet are secondary: - & the sides of
vallies in the neighbourhood afford
abundance of mineral veins -

- It will be unnecessary to pursue
these statements to any greater extent. -
Sufficient has I trust been said, to
prove that the Science may be of National,
as well as of individual advantage -
& at least, to establish its Utility. -
- It is far from my wish to endeavour
to exalt Geology to a higher rank
than it ought to occupy, or to attempt
to raise it unfairly above the other
branches of physical Knowledge. -
- But I should be unjust to my Subject,
were I not to state, some of the
peculiar advantages which it possesses
- as [underline]a Science of Contemplation - &[/underline] as a
[underline]series of important truths,[/underline] unfolding
[underline]some of the most beautiful & harmonious[/underline]
[underline]parts of the Economy of Nature. -[/underline]
- Of all material objects that
can employ our attention, those that

[page]66|MS-DAVY-10402-000-00066|dnp04a266pp|88270956[/page]
are nearest to us, ought to excite the
[underline]warmest[/underline] & the most [underline]immediate interest[/underline];
And after Man, & animated Nature,
no subject of physical enquiry bears
a more distinct relation to us, than
the place of our abode, [underline]the Earth[/underline],
to which we are necessarily attached,
& the mechanism of which, is intimately
connected with all our [underline]powers[/underline],
our enjoyments, & even our existence. -
- |_The mere [insertion]mere[/insertion] general Study of the
Science, of the Constitution of the Globe,
affords some very beautiful & sublime
views which could never be gained
from the common observation of external
nature. - It explains the [deletion]uses &[/deletion]
importance of the [underline]variety[/underline] & [underline]irregularities[/underline]
which it exhibits & [underline]demonstrates[/underline]
that no parts are useless. - & that
the causes which apparently produce
destruction & disorder are in fact,
in the general series connected with
the renovation & support of the system.

- - If the interest of this Species of
knowledge, is considerable, the [underline]facility[/underline]
of acquiring it, ought at least to be
a motive why it should be pursued. -
It requires no laborious or continued
investigation - no expensive or
complicated apparatus, - no minute
processes upon the unknown properties
of matter. ---
- It demands only an enquiring
[deletion]Genius[/deletion] [insertion]understanding[/insertion], an acquaintance with
certain simple elements of knowledge,
& a mind alive to the facts
which are almost every where
presented in Nature. -
-- Geology is as yet in an infant
state; the great arrangements
only are known - And whoever
furnishes to it, new Histories

of facts , becomes an improver of the
Science . --
- The ease with which discoveries are
made  ought undoubtedly to fix the
attention of active Spirits. - In this
department of knowledge, there are
fields of investigation, yet unexplored
rich in fact & in theory - & the

[underline]reason[/underline], [deletion]&[/deletion] the [underline]imagination[/underline] . -
- The Person who is attached to
Geological enquiries, can scarcely
ever want objects of employment
& of interest. -
- The Ground on which he treads. -
The Country which surrounds him;
& even the Rocks & Stones removed
from their natural positions by Art,
are all capable of affording him

some degree of amusement. - And
every new mine or quarry that is opened,
every new surface of the Earth that is
laid bare, & every new Country
that is discovered, offers [deletion]to him[/deletion]
novel Sources of information. --
- In Travelling, he is [deletion]attached[/deletion] [insertion]interested in[/insertion]
[deletion]to[/deletion] a pursuit, which must constantly
preserve the Mind awake to the Scenes
presented to it. - And the beauty,
- the majesty, & the [underline]sublimity[/underline] of the
[underline]great forms of[/underline] Nature, must necessarily
be inhanced, by the contemplation
of their order, their [deletion]natural[/deletion] mutual
dependence - their connection as a
whole . ---
- The imagery of a Mountain Country
which is the very Theatre of the Science,
is in almost all cases highly impressive
& delightful. - but a new & a

to life are considered. ---
- - To the Geological Enquirers,
every Mountain Chain, offers decided
proofs of the great alterations
that the Globe has undergone. --
The most sublime speculations are
awakened. - the mind is carried
into past ages. - New forms of
[underline]existence[/underline] are presented to it,
& a boundless enquiry. - the
destruction of a former order of things
& a system arranged with harmony,
filled with beauty & life, - formed
from its elements, & established
on its ruins. --
