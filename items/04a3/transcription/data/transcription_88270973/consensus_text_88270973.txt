[underline]Geology[/underline]
[underline]Lecture 2[/underline]
[underline]1811[/underline]
The Plan which I propose
to adopt in treating of Geology, &
which I announced in the introductory
Lecture, will I feel, offer much
less amusement, than those that are
usually followed; -
To connect the facts belonging
to the mechanism of the Earth, with a
general hypothesis of cosmogony, &
to make them subservient to speculative
views, offers more pleasing associations
to the Memory, & more brilliant
pictures to the Imagination, than
the mere simple development of the
real order & existing arrangements
of Nature. -
