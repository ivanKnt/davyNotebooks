- In proceeding to consider our subject -
- the arrangement of the Rocks in Nature
I shall adopt the division, to which
I referred in the last Lecture,
into Primary and Secondary. -
but to prevent any misconception of
the uses of the terms, I shall
offer a few observations upon
them. - - - -
When the word Primitive, or
primary, was first adopted by
Lehman in the Science, |_ it
signified [underline]the unaltered matter[/underline]
[underline]of the Globe[/underline], [insertion]the matter in which[/insertion] no vestiges of a
former order analogous to the
existing order of Things were to
be found. This meaning, has
however gradually been changed,
& the term is now [deletion]usually[/deletion] often,
applied to all Rocks that
do not contain [underline]organic remains[/underline]. -
