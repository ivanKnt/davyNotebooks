Equator, & the heights of Mountains
diminish towards the Poles. -
- |_The general [unclear]agency[/unclear] of Mountains, is
that of cooling; |_but they lilkewise
often influence the course of
the Winds, so as to protect the
[underline]lower[/underline]regions from their [underline]effects [/underline]. -
- In Britain for instance, the
principal Mountains occur in the
North & North East |_& our hottest
[underline]winds in Summer[/underline] , & our [underline]coldest[/underline]
[underline]winds in winter[/underline], blow [underline]from these[/underline]
[underline]Quarters;[/underline] so that their situation
is well adapted to diminish the
heat in one case, & to break
the force of the Cold blast, in
the other case. -
