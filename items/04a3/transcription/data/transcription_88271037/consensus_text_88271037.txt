- When Newton applied his
unparalleled Sagacity to the development
of the Order of the Planetary System. -
- He did not begin his researches by
endeavouring to discover, how they
received their present forms; or
how they were endowed with
the power of motion -
- These questions he left untouched. -
He was contented with the arrangement
of known phenomena, & [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the
explanation of Nature, by analogy,
compared with facts. - And
in consequence, he had the
Glory of unfolding the
[underline]most Sublime Laws[/underline] of the
[underline]System[/underline], attained by human
Intelligence. - Such an
example, may be successfully
imitated, in all researches. -
