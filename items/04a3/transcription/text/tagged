[underline]Geology[/underline]
[underline]Lecture 2[/underline]
[underline]1811[/underline]
The Plan which I propose
to adopt in treating of Geology, &
which I announced in the introductory
Lecture, will I feel, offer much
less amusement, than those that are
usually followed; -
To connect the facts belonging
to the mechanism of the Earth, with a
general hypothesis of cosmogony, &
to make them subservient to speculative
views, offers more pleasing associations
to the Memory, & more brilliant
pictures to the Imagination, than
the mere simple development of the
real order & existing arrangements
of Nature. -

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00002|dnp04a302pp|88270974[/page]
- The phenomena of the external
World , as well as the passions &
feelings of the human mind, are
most impressive, when they are
connected [underline]by distant[/underline] & varied
[underline]analogies, & tinted[/underline] with the
brilliant hues of fancy. -
- |_ But the end of Science ought
to be [underline]Truth[/underline], simple, unadorned
[underline]Truth[/underline] & her great object
[underline]Utility[/underline]. |_& in the pursuit of
Truth, that which was at first
a labour, soon becomes a pleasure;
for the results are permanent,
the effect important, & the delight
that the mind receives, constantly
increases. - It is neither capricious
nor transitory, for it is founded
upon the operation of Laws, which

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00003|dnp04a303pp|88270975[/page]
are wisely & benevolently constituted,
& which are eternal in their operation. -
- |_The contemplation of the general
exterior of the Earth, shews that even
its irregularities are happily disposed.
The bleak & elevated Mountain, is
contrasted with the [insertion]sheltered &[/insertion] deep valley.- The
shaggy & wooded hill, with the level
& cultivated plain - & the bright
& even expanse of Sea or Sky, with
the deep tinted & unequal Land. -
Scenes abound in all parts harmonious;
& more delightful, from being warm
with animation, & full of the forms
of life. - -

- On penetrating beneath the
surface, however, a new, & altogether
a different order of Things is presented

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00004|dnp04a304pp|88270976[/page]
to our attention. All is dark
& silent. - Soils, earthy Strata
& Rocks are blended together,
apparently without symmetry or
beauty. Veins of metallic ores,
& of crystallized stones intersect
them in different directions,
& by a transient examination,
deformity & disorder only, are
perceptible in the subterraneous
mineral Kingdom. - -
- This effect of confusion,
however, soon ceases, in the
[underline]investigating[/underline] Mind. - For by
continued observation & sagacious
comparison, a [underline]certain arrangement[/underline]
is perceived, even in those
rudest of the forms of Matter. -
- A distinct analogy appears between
their parts, |_ & by their utility & importance

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00005|dnp04a305pp|88270977[/page]

in the general System of Nature, is
gradually unfolded, becoming clearer
& clearer, till at length it [underline]produces[/underline]
full & pleasing conviction. - -
- - The orders of Rocks that compose
the known part of the surface of the Earth, are
very few, & even the species are not
numerous; but the varieties are
almost infinite. - - -
- - The minute study of varieties is
however seldom necessary, except
in cases, when they are connected
with the transition or passage of
one species into another. - |_Usually
they present the same Characters,
speak the same language, tell the
same tale. -
- - It is upon the distinct outlines
in Nature, the marked & well

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00006|dnp04a306pp|88270978[/page]
defined differences that Geology
truly depends; & for accuracy
of Classification & facility of
Enquiry, - two kinds of Characters
[deletion]are[/deletion] at least, [insertion]are[/insertion] required. -
- The first Characters are those
gained from the minute examination
of insulated specimens, from the
inherent qualities which belong
to the smallest fragment containing
all the elements of the Rock. -
- The second are the Characters
of the Rock considered as
a great mass, or as composed
of parts, bearing to each other
a determinate & ascertainable
relation. - - -
- In the first series, the

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00007|dnp04a307pp|88270979[/page]
principal properties to be attended to,
are, the figure, & appearance
of fracture, the Crystallizations, if
any exist, the specific weight, the
hardness, & the relation to [insertion]magnetic[/insertion] Polarity
of Electricity, & to the power of
conducting heat - to taste, to
smell & to touch. -
- In insulated Geological
Specimens, the natural fractures
ought to be preserved, & two
new fractures, one parallel to
the horizon, & the other perpendicular
to it, should be made, & an
anciently exposed surface ought
to be suffered to remain. -
- All this I know, is
contrary to the method, of the
greater number of the [person]person_267|Wernerians[/person],

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00008|dnp04a308pp|88270980[/page]
who give to their [underline]specimens however[/underline]
[underline]different[/underline], the same square form, &
make on every side a new fracture,
which answers very well in Mineralogy
for Cabinet Specimens, but which in
Geology destroys very important
indications. For in this [deletion]instance[/deletion] [insertion]Science[/insertion]
the specimen ought only to be an assistance
to the study of the Rock - And
in Rocks, fresh fractures are seldom
to be expected; & they present chiefly
points, & irregular outlines. -
- In examining the fracture of
a Rock, if any small irregularities
of colour or form appear, the eye
should be assisted by a glass |_ and
where large but imperfect, ill defined
Crystals exist, an attempt should be
made to fracture them in the

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00009|dnp04a309pp|88270981[/page]
3
[underline]direction[/underline] of the parallel & transverse
lines, [underline]which they present[/underline], in order to ascertain
if possible, the primitive form. And
for the purpose, a common penknife
& a small hammer may be used. -
- The specific gravity, or the relation
of the weight to that of water, may be
known by ascertaining what weight of
water, a given weight of the fossil will
displace. - The [insertion]magnetic[/insertion] polarity, (if any)
may be ascertained by a small needle. -
The Electrical power by rubbing the
specimen with [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] or by heating it. -
The hardness may be judged of by the
knife, or by the use of a ring or
plate containing a series of stones
differing in hardness from the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical]
to [chemical]chemical_406|Calcareous Spar[/chemical]. - The other qualities
are obvious, & require no elucidation
of method. - -

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00010|dnp04a310pp|88270982[/page]
- In determining the Nature of a
particular Rock, a very few Characters
usually are adequate; often indeed,
a single one is sufficient. -
Habitual & attentive observation,
will soon enable the Student
to catch by a single glance of the
eye, or a touch of the hand,
the quality, which marks the
[underline]greater number of common Geological[/underline]
[underline]Species[/underline]; & the complication of
method is principally necessary
only in detecting new varieties. -
- [deletion]I have procured[/deletion] [insertion]All[/insertion] the Specimens
necessary for elucidating the minute
Characters of Geology [insertion]are [insertion]to be[/insertion] found in the Museum of this Institution[superscript]*[/superscript][/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] I shall
continually have occasion to refer
to them, & I shall mention
their characteristic properties. -

On this point unfortunately, no
appeal can be made to the senses,
at the time of the description, but
the bodies [insertion]themselves may be[/insertion] [deletion]have their names affixed[/deletion]
[deletion]to them[/deletion], & maybe examined [insertion]minutely[/insertion] by
those who may consider the study
worthy of their attention. -
- The study of rocks as Masses
require infinitely less preparation, &
less detail of minute practices.
Each species has an aspect, of a
general series of Characters peculiar
to itself of which when attentively
examined, may in many cases be
made, even at considerable distances
an accurate indication of its nature.
The form of the outline, the colour
the interruptions of the surface, the

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00012|dnp04a312pp|88270984[/page]
lines of the Strata, or blocks, & the
magnitude of the projecting or
retiring angles; are all amongst
the grand external characteristics. -
- Instruments are seldom required
[underline]for assisting[/underline] in the discovery of
them, And indeed, almost the
only ones that can be employed
are a pocket telescope, a [deletion][misc]misc_399|goniometer[/misc][/deletion] [insertion]2 mile [deletion]sect [/deletion] quadrant[/insertion]
for discovering angles. - a barometer
for ascertaining heights & a
measuring staff. - - -
- The study of the aspect
of Rocks, & Mountains is one
of the most delightful departments
of the Science; & it is constantly
connected with the new, the
diversified, the beautiful,
& the sublime in Nature. -

- In this Room it can be illustrated by
feeble & imperfect sketches only, but
these will at least be adequate to
exhibit the important facts; they will
point out [deletion]most distinctly[/deletion] the methods,
& the nature of the enquiry, &
[underline]the arrangements most worthy of[/underline]
[underline]being examined[/underline]. -
- On the point of the aspect of
[underline]Rocks & Mountains[/underline], the views
of the Geologist, are directed to
the same grand objects as those
of the [underline]Poet & the Printer[/underline] - But
Science makes [underline]distinct[/underline] what Taste
would require to be [underline]obscure[/underline];
its elements are collected only from
the simple & [underline]permanent[/underline]; &
it leaves to the arts of imagination,
the charms & graces of the [underline]indefinite[/underline]
& the [underline]mutable[/underline]. -

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00014|dnp04a314pp|88270986[/page]
- In proceeding to consider our subject -
- the arrangement of the Rocks in Nature
I shall adopt the division, to which
I referred in the last Lecture,
into Primary and Secondary. -
but to prevent any misconception of
the uses of the terms, I shall
offer a few observations upon
them. - - - -
When the word Primitive, or
primary, was first adopted by
[person]person_305|Lehman[/person] in the Science, |_ it
signified [underline]the unaltered matter[/underline]
[underline]of the Globe[/underline], [insertion]the matter in which[/insertion] no vestiges of a
former order analogous to the
existing order of Things were to
be found. This meaning, has
however gradually been changed,
& the term is now [deletion]usually[/deletion] often,
applied to all Rocks that
do not contain [underline]organic remains[/underline]. -

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00015|dnp04a315pp|88270987[/page]
And in consequence, it is often made
use of, to denote rocks that abound
in fragments derived from the
destruction of other Rocks. - Thus
it is not uncommon to hear primary
Sandstones spoken of. -
In this application, I venture
to disclaim the use of the words,
I shall adhere to the first signification. -
Whenever Strata or Rocks, contain
any vestiges of destruction or
renovation, I shall consider them
as Secondary. - & by dividing
the two classes into [insertion]different[/insertion] orders, all
the necessary distinctions, may
I am convinced, be observed. -
- It is but paying a just
tribute of respect to [person]person_305|Lehman[/person], to
whom we owe so much, - that
of preserving the purity of his

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00016|dnp04a316pp|88270988[/page]
definition - It is greatly of his
Glory that 50 years have passed
away, of continued progress in
the science, & yet his general
Classification, still retains
all its truth & utility.
- Primary rocks are distributed
in considerable masses or Strata,
& constitute a great part of
the known solid matter of the
Globe - They are found
at the remotest depths below
the surface & form by far
the greatest portion of the highest
Mountain Chains [deletion]belonging[/deletion]
[deletion]to the Globe[/deletion]. -
- Of the orders in this
Class, the Granitic Rocks,

The variety of colours which [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical]

are principally owing to the veins

are of after formation & most probably
derive their existence from the

- It is a general fact, of considerable
importance - That where a Coast is
Mountainous & elevated, a correspondent
depth of Sea occurs close to the Land.
|_& in many cases this circumstance
produces very extensive & beneficial
results. |_On the coast of [place]place_188|Norway[/place]
for example, there is a great range

that the Northern Sea for 12 degrees

whole depth it is cooled nearby to
the degree of congelation. -
- In the high Northern Ocean,
a winter does not afford sufficient
time for the cooling of the whole
maps, but in the shallows off
the Coast of Denmark & of Holland,
though in a much lower latitude,
the sea is soon closed by the first
severe Cold. -
Were the high North seas frozen
our Winters would be infinitely more
severe than they are at present,
& our summers, much more wet
& disagreeable. |_And there is
great reason to believe that our
general temperature instead of
being tolerably mild would approach
very near to that of [place]place_1007|Kamschatka[/place],
which is situated under the same

14
parallels of latitude, & which owes
its coldness, in great part, to the
vicinity of the icy sea. -

- Hills & Mountains are the great
sources of Rivers & of Springs. - In
consequence of their low temperature,
they are constantly precipitating moisture
from the air. |_ And from the Clouds
which form on them, or from the thawing
of snow; there is a continued
supply of water; which is carried

prevent water, & the matter
capable of being organized from
penetrating to too great a depth,
where they would be lost &
useless to the living World. -
- By the irregularities in

are [underline]not inhabited by living[/underline] Beings,

impressive in the circumstance, that
these mechanical Elements of Rocks,
are themselves chemically composed of
a very small number of [deletion]single[/deletion] [insertion]undecompounded[/insertion]

[page]54|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00054|dnp04a354pp|88271029[/page]
substances, which in some cases, are
the same in essence & differ only
in their proportions. -
- By the methods of the Chemist
the hardest stones are capable of being
brought into solution, & their different
Elementary materials separated from
each other, & obtained in their pure
forms. -
- Refined Analysis, completed
by the labour of ingenious Philosophers
of the present day, have shown, that
the great ingredients which constitute
the Primitive Rocks are four Earths,
[chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical];
fixed alkalies & the [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical]; -
& these are usually all combined
in different proportions in the various
aggregated parts. -
Thus [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical] consists principally

[page]55|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00055|dnp04a355pp|88271030[/page]
15
of siliceous Earth, with very minute
portions of [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical], & [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical].
- [chemical]chemical_406|Calcareous Spar[/chemical], contains chiefly [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical],
& [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical]; but generally a perceptible
portion of some, or all of the other
ingredients. -
- [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] contains all of the five
substances in different quantities & united
to fixed alkali - And [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical],
[chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_404|Talc[/chemical], contain, as individuals,
all the five elements. - but [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical]
is the most abundant in [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical],
[chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] in [chemical]chemical_404|Talc[/chemical], & [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] in
[chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical].
- But these Earths & alkalies are
themselves compounds, & analogous in
constitution. - For they consist of
Metals united to [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], one of the
constituents of the Atmosphere. - This
I have endeavoured to shew, by a copious

[page]56|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00056|dnp04a356pp|88271031[/page]
collection of experiments & observations
in the Chemical Lectures. -
[deletion][underline]Instance.[/underline][/deletion]
- The power of decomposition in the
possession of Chemistry are very extensive,
but those of composition, are extremely
limited. We have attained the
power of extracting Metals, from the
alkalies & Earths: & these Metals
can again be restored to their primary
state: but as yet there have
been, no successful imitations
of the Crystallized arrangements
belonging to Nature. -
-  I stated [insertion]in the introductory lecture[/insertion] that the formation
of the Primary Rocks may be
hypothetically explained by conceiving
the central part of the Globe
principally constituted by the
metals of the Earths; & that

[page]57|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00057|dnp04a357pp|88271032[/page]
Rocks of strata would result from the
action of air & water, upon these highly
inflammable materials; but still
even in this view, another hypothesis
is necessary for the continued renovation
of the System. -
- The want of Coaly matter in
the primary rocks, is an argument
against their having been parts of an
Order similar to that now in existence;-
For coaly matter is [underline]an almost indestructible[/underline]
Substance: & abounds in every part
of our existing Continents & Islands.-
& is discovered in large quantities in
all the rocks of Secondary formation.-
- In all Systems for explaining the
formation of Primary Rocks, a fluid
state, either from igneous or aqueous
fusion is assumed; but it is not

[page]58|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00058|dnp04a358pp|88271033[/page]
explained why different Crystals
should separate in the same mass. -
And this enquiry can be enlightened
by no other means, than the
exaltation of our Chemical powers. -
[insertion][underline]bland[/underline][/insertion]
- Wherever Natural Causes
can be fairly investigated, it is
the business of Philosophy to endeavor
to trace them. - And no objects
of research, however [underline]hidden[/underline], connected
with [underline]the discovery[/underline], [underline]ought to be[/underline]
[underline]neglected[/underline], provided instruments
of investigation, can be applied
[underline]to them[/underline]; provided they are
capable of being elucidated,
by analogical inferences, from
known facts. - But in cases
where there are no Histories to guide
us, no distinct reasonings to assist
us, & no experiments to enlighten us.
- There the human powers must be

uselessly applied, & all the efforts of
ingenuity, wholly wasted. -
- The discovery of the limits between
what is capable of being known, &
what must be for ever concealed from
us, with regard to the [underline]Theory of the[/underline]
[underline]Earth[/underline], is perhaps not very distant.
- In every [insertion]quick[/insertion] view of the subject -
Some point must be taken, from which
to begin, some primary state of things
- or some part of an order of revolution -
- & [underline]where no change[/underline] is to be perceived,
there it seems reasonable to suspend
our enquiries, & to consider the facts
as Ultimate. -
- In this case, there is some
foundation, for gradually creating a
Theory - in the other, there is no
basis to begin with. -

[page]60|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00060|dnp04a360pp|88271035[/page]
In the operations of Nature,
there is a continued succession; a destruction,
& renovation of forms. - But our view,
& our period of existence, limit us
to the few objects surrounding us. -
Suns & Worlds may be created, &
may decay, by uniform Laws, ordained
by infinite Wisdom, & our Earth, as
a part of the Planetary System, may
participate in a [underline]New Order[/underline]. - But
these objects are far beyond Mortal Men;
the imagination soars towards them in
vain; its efforts are idle &
unavailing; its strength is wasted
in dreams. -
- In the common course of
Natural events there is Solution,
& decomposition, & consolidation,
& the agency of water, & of fire;
- but nothing results analogous to

[page]61|MS-DAVY-10403-000-00061|dnp04a361pp|88271036[/page]
the [underline]primary [deletion]Rocks[/deletion] bodies.[/underline]. -
- Calcareous concretions are formed,
Rocks are destroyed by the agency of air,
& new masses regenerated. - but they
bear the stamp of their origin. -
- Nature acts by Rivers & by Seas
- but no substances, like the primary
substances, are ever produced
[underline]in them[/underline]. - She pours forth
from the volcano, the fused
materials of strata; but as far
as they have been examined, they
cool into amorphous masses, or
into simple crystalline forms. -
- She raises Islands from the
bottom of the Sea by submarine
explosions, but they are found
to present either [underline]Lava[/underline] or [underline]Sand[/underline] &
unaltered Rocks. -

- When [person]person_036|Newton[/person] applied his
unparalleled Sagacity to the development
of the Order of the Planetary System. -
- He did not begin his researches by
endeavouring to discover, how they
received their present forms; or
how they were endowed with
the power of motion -
- These questions he left untouched. -
He was contented with the arrangement
of known phenomena, & [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the
explanation of Nature, by analogy,
compared with facts. - And
in consequence, he had the
Glory of unfolding the
[underline]most Sublime Laws[/underline] of the
[underline]System[/underline], attained by human
Intelligence. - Such an
example, may be successfully
imitated, in all researches. -
