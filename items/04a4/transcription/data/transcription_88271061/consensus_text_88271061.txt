matters in mixtures - And it
is this method which is described
by Diodorus Siculus "These Men"
says he, alluding to the Cornish
Britons, manufacture their Tin
by working the grounds that produce
it with great Art.- For though the
Land is rocky, yet it has soft
layers in it, in which the treasure
is found.- whence the miners separate
it, melt it & purify it."-
- But in proportion as Tin
ore became more rare in the
beds of rivers, & in the lowlands,
the search for it as extended
into the soil that covers the
hills, & the original veins
were in consequence discovered,
& the manner of tracing them
by their detached productions
has been ever since in common
use.-
