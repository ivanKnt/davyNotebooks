- Indications of Metallic Ores
are often furnished by the impregnations
in water issuing from the Springs in
metalliferous strata.- Impregnations
of iron, & of copper are the most
common, & the cupreous impregnation
may always be distinguished by
exposing iron or steel to the fluid.

- A remarkable instance of the
discovery of Metallic veins from
these circumstances, lately occurred
in North Wales.- At the foot
of a hill near Dolgethly, the
water is highly impregnated with
a salt of copper; so highly, that
the peat of a bog, into which it
has discharged itself, is sufficiently
loaded with the metal to afford
it advantageously by burning.-
