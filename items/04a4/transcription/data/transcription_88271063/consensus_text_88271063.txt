- When I was on the spot
in June 1805, I observed that
the vegetation was considerably
injured upon the course of the
Springs, & the only plant that
seemed to flourish near them
was the Statice. All the
circumstances appeared to point
out distinctly the directions of the
veins & I have been informed,
that by pursuing the indications,
a considerable copper mine, has
been discovered, & is now
advantageously worked.-
- Wherever in a mining Country
indeed, peculiar spots unnaturally
sterile are perceived, there is great
reason to suppose that the effect
has some connexion with the
presence of veins of Copper or of Iron.-
