- The divining Rod is a forked stick
of hazel, which when held horizontally,
a branch being in each hand, was
supposed to be attracted by Metals.-
- Most of the ancient writers on
Metallurgy, have given long Theories
to account for the efficacy of the rod,
& even as late as 1778, M[superscript]r[/superscript].. Pryce

should have such a particular
affection for these effluvia.-
- The divining rod, it is well

of Springs of water, as well as of
metallic veins; & there are
very respectable & excellent Persons
