- [underline]Analogy generally[/underline] our sure &
correct guide in the Sciences, sometimes
by accidental misapplication leads us
into errors, which are the more
dangerous, as they are obtained
by methods generally subservient
to the discovery of truth.-
- Accustomed in the Animal
& Vegetable Kingdoms to associate
increase & decay, with every species
of regularity of form: the Mind
is easily seduced into the notion
the the crystallizations found
beneath the surface of the Earth,
follow a similar Law; & this
notion becomes strengthened, by
the facts that are daily occurring
& that are capable of being
artificially exhibited, of the
gradual formation of [underline]regular Solids[/underline]
