imitated. -
- There are a number of facts
which prove that some of the metallic
ores in veins, acted on by air, are
capable of being dissolved by water; 
& deposited from it in new forms. - 
- It is evident from the views
that have been developed, that
veins must be very irregular in
their dispositions & ramifications,
& that they must deviate in
various ways from the perpendiculars,
& that they can never be expected
rectilinear or equable through
the whole of their course. - There
is however a certain general order
of direction, which must have been
connected with the similarity
of the causes by which they were
produced. -
