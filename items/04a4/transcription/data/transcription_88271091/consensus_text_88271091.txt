- Most of the great veins that afford
Gold & Silver in South America are said
to have a direction from East to West.-
- Some of the principal veins in Hungary
& Transylvania run from North East
to South West.- But in Britain,
the greatest metalliferous veins, all have
their course within a few points from
East to West.-
- This is equally the case in the primitive
& in the Secondary districts.- In
Cornwall, in Devonshire, & in Argyleshire,
in Cumberland, Northumberland &
Durham.-

upon the point of junction between
the shist & the granite.-
