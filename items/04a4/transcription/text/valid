[underline]Geology.[/underline]
- The Aspects of Rocks & of
Mountains, (we have seen) afford
characteristic indications of their nature,
And the irregularities of fracture &
of structure presented by their exposed
surfaces, usually extend throughout
the mass; & if the visible exterior,
affords strong inferences with regard
to the unknown interior constitution.-
- In every family, even in every
order, a particular disposition of the
parts has been demonstrated; a separation
into various forms, bounded by
distinct outlines, & presenting distinct
apertures.-
- But besides the apertures, by
which Rocks are divided into Blocks,

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00002|dnp04a402pp|88271045[/page]
or into Strata, there are others
much more considerable, Chasms
of great depth & magnitude, &
which often extend throughout a
whole district.-
- These chasms bear evident
marks of having been formed since
the consolidation of the mass.-
Their sides correspond to each other,
their angles of fracture are identical,
& they exhibit the proofs of the agency
of a powerful cause of mechanical
separation.-
- The accurate inspection of Strata
fully demonstrates, that a number
of chasms existed in the early
periods of the changes of our globe,
which have been since filled with
mineral substances.- And it is
in this state, in which they still
retain the marks of their original

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00003|dnp04a403pp|88271046[/page]
conformation.- It is in this state that
they are called veins.-
- A sketch of a vein was displayed
in a former Lecture, but more refined
elucidations may be necessary for a
correct notion of the subject.-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[underline]pipe vein[/underline]
- So that evidently in every vein
there is to be considered,- the matter
of which it is composed - its irregularity
of constitution - its directions & ramifications.
- The contents of veins are wonderfully
diversified; & almost all the substances
which form the objects of Mineralogical
Science, occur in them.- It is in
veins, that Nature displays the
most regular of her mineral productions.
- It is in these, no longer rude, or
confused in her arrangements, that

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00004|dnp04a404pp|88271047[/page]
She exhibits her exquisite Crystallisation,
having evolved from a few elementary
Gems, an infinite variety of
beautiful combinations, which to
unravel & understand, requires
all the skill of the Geometer.-
- It seldom happens that any
vein is filled up by a uniform
substance If many different species
of minerals occur even in the
same section:- & when metallic
ores are found, they are almost
always embedded in some
peculiar stoney matter, different
from the mass of the Rocks.-
[underline]Instance[/underline].
- The same fissure often extends
for a great number of miles. &
often intersects various Orders
& even Classes of Rocks: & in
this case, in its different positions

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00005|dnp04a405pp|88271048[/page]

it is usually filled with very different
substances.-
- There is a very striking instance
of the difference of the composition
of a vein, in its course through
different rocks at S[superscript]t[/superscript]. Michael's
Mount in Cornwall.-
- I shall shew a sketch of the
spot, & though the minute fact
can scarcely be exhibited by means
of it; yet the elucidation will
be more distinct.-
[underline]Instance[/underline].
- S[superscript]t[/superscript]. Michael's Mount is principally
composed of primary Granite, but
upon its East extremity, a small
quantity of Micaceous Shist is
incumbent, & above the junction
of the Primary Rocks, there
is a layer of secondary Granite.-
One vein cuts through them all,

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00006|dnp04a406pp|88271049[/page]
but in the primary rocks, it is
filled with quartz & a little
Chlorite, & in the secondary
granite, it contains principally
[chemical]chemical_290|Shorl[/chemical] & Mica, with tin ore.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- Similar circumstances occur,
perhaps more distinctly in the
Rocks of parallel Stratification;
|_And the whole of the Strata of
a Country, are often cut through
by the [underline]same vein[/underline], having a few
different ramifications.-
- This represents a Section of
part of the Strata in Alston Moor,
which have been already noticed
for their number & variety.-
- The same vein with its
ramifications cuts through them all;
but it differs very much in its

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00007|dnp04a407pp|88271050[/page]
nature in [underline]different parts[/underline].- In the
limestone, & stratified Basalt, it often
contains [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical], with quartz, & heavy spar.-
- In the hard Shale, it sometimes
contains a little Copper with Calcareous
spar. And in the Coal of [underline]soft[/underline] shell
[underline]strata[/underline], it is principally filled
with Calcareous spar & pyrites.-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- At the fall of the Tees in
Yorkshire, there is a considerable
vein which passes through all the
Strata.- It principally consists
of carbonate of lime, or calcareous spar.
- but it produces a little [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical].
& blende in the Stratified basalt;
- In the shale it contains some

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00008|dnp04a408pp|88271051[/page]
- It often happens that where the
same vein passes through different
Strata, there is a shift or dip,
so that the same Strata on
one side of the vein, are lower
than those on the other side.-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
which would seem to indicate
that the original fissure had
been produced, either by the
elevation of one part of the rocks
by a force acting from below,
or by the depression or sinking
down of the other part.-
- The Primary Rocks contain
very large veins, but few
of them are abundant in
Metallic Substances.-
- The fissures in the great
Primary Chains of Granite,
are principally filled by

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00009|dnp04a409pp|88271052[/page]
3.
Secondary rocks; but they sometimes contain
peculiar crystallized materials, such
as the tourmaline, the beryl, &
other gems.-
Mines are very rarely worked
in primary Granite.- In the
great Granit√©e Chain of the Swiss
Alps, there is no mining district.-
In Cornwall, in general so abundant
in the Metals, - in the truly
primary material of the Country,
they very seldom occur. |_And
there is I believe, only one
anomalous instance in Britain
& that occurs at Strontian, in
the Western Highlands.-
- In a Mountain of hard granite,
at least 2000 feet above the level
of the Sea, an immense fissure

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00010|dnp04a410pp|88271053[/page]
occurs, which contains a wonderful
variety of crystallized substances,
& which is advantageously worked
for [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical] ore.-
- Next to the primary granite
in the vein, is a layer of
secondary granite, which is called
on the spot, [underline]red rider[/underline] - adhering
to this, is calcareous spar -
Upon the Calcareous Spar Zeolite,
Staurolite, & the peculiar fossil
called Strontianite, which as yet
has been found in this form, in
no other place.- of the [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical]

- Inc Primitive Gneis - in
Micaceous Shist & in Sienite,

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00011|dnp04a411pp|88271054[/page]
metallic veins are likewise very
rarely found. but they sometimes
occur in primitive porphyries &
in Marbles.-
- Serpentine, is intersected
by a great number of fissures,
but they usually contain soft
substances, Steatite, Asbestus,
& sometimes Calcareous Spar.-
Native Copper has sometimes occurred
in a Crystallized state in them.-
- But the Secondary Countries
are the great mining districts,
& a variety of metalliferous veins
occur in most of the different
families, which were the subjects
of the last lecture.-
- In the beds of the Secondary
Granites, Porphyries, & Micaceous
Shists - Extensive veins are found,

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00012|dnp04a412pp|88271055[/page]
which usually contain Quartz
& [deletion][chemical]chemical_074|Chlorite[/chemical][/deletion], but sometimes heavy spar,
fluor spar, & calcareous spars;
& the ores of Tin, [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical], Manganese,
Zinc, & Copper, are found in
them. - The Metalliferous
Rock of Cornwall called by
the Miners, Growan, & which
is one of the most common
beds of Tin ore, is a secondary

- The great Mine in Anglesea
is in the Siliceous Shist, principally
composed of compact feldspar & [chemical]chemical_074|Chlorite[/chemical]
- [deletion]No[/deletion] The veins in the grauwackes & breccias
of this family are metalliferous,-
the limestone often contains Copper
& sometimes [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical].-
- Amongst the secondary Rocks
of the third family, the stratified
Rocks; Limestone is above all
others, productive of the Metals.-
Copper, Zinc, [chemical]chemical_009|Lead[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical], Manganese
& Cobalt are found in it.-
- In Derbyshire, Limestone is
the only metalliferous rock.-
But in the North of England, the
stratified Basalt (as we have
seen likewise) contains [chemical]chemical_009|Lead[/chemical].

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00014|dnp04a414pp|88271057[/page]
- The Crystallized substances which
usually form the sides of the vein, in
the different secondary Rocks, are
principally fluor spar, heavy spar
& Quartz.-
[underline]Sandstone[/underline] seldom contains any vein
of useful ore;- they are never found
in loose shale, nor in Columnar Basalt.-
- The columnar Basalt is seldom
intersected by many fissures; & when
they occur, they are either calcareous
Spar or Zeolite.- Zeolite indeed
often occurs in it, in large Cavities.-
[underline]Instance [/underline].
- There are certain general rules
with regard to the indications of
Metals, which will apply equally,
to the productions in the primary
& the Secondary Rocks.-
- Whenever a vein of Quartz,

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00015|dnp04a415pp|88271058[/page]
Spar, or any other white substance
near the surface, contains in its
cavities much [underline]brown powder[/underline] or dust,
there is always a great probability,
that [deletion]a metallic[/deletion] ore will be found
at no great [underline]distance[/underline].-
- This brown powder is [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical] in a
particular state, which almost
always accompanies [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical] & copper.-
- A green colour in a vein of
[underline]quartz[/underline] or [underline]spar[/underline], likewise, generally
indicates that metallic ore is at
no great distance; & it is usually
connected with pyrites or Tin.-
- A dull green substance of this
kind, in the Cornish & Saxon Mines
is often found in the same vein
with tin, it is a variety of
Chlorite.- [underline]Instance[/underline].-
- But when a bright green
powder, or crystallized substance

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00016|dnp04a416pp|88271059[/page]
is found it indicates [underline]Copper[/underline] |_ And
the tint itself, is almost always
owing to the presence of Copper.-
- There are two kinds of Spar
which scarcely ever occur in the
veins of Secondary Country, without
being connected with metallic ore,
they are the rhomboidal spar, called
Pearlspar, & Witherite or Carbonate
of Barytes.-
- These are indications of Metals,
when veins are distinct, & laid
bare in any of their parts.- but
there are other indications, which
require more [underline]extensive geological[/underline]
[underline]observations[/underline], though in general,
they have been considered only
after [underline]partial views[/underline]. & applied
only, by the habitual &
[underline]practical tact[/underline] of [underline]the Miner[/underline].-

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00017|dnp04a417pp|88271060[/page]

- Metallic veins are often discovered
by the loose materials which have
been detached from them by decomposition
from the action of water & air in the
lapse of time,- & the method of
searching for metals by examining
the detached stones, in the soil of
a valley, or in a chasm on the
side of a hill, is called in
Cornwall where it is most practised
[underline]Shodeing [/underline].-
- In this district the only
Metal known in early times was
Tin, & till after the establishment
of the [insertion]Norman [insertion][unclear][deletion]Neacdxxxxx[/deletion][/unclear][/insertion][/insertion] dynasty, even [underline]Tin ore[/underline]
was unknown as a production of
veins; & it was raised from the
alluvial depositions in vallies, &
separated in consequence of its
specific weight from the Earthy

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00018|dnp04a418pp|88271061[/page]
matters in mixtures - And it
is this method which is described
by Diodorus Siculus "These Men"
says he, alluding to the Cornish
Britons, manufacture their Tin
by working the grounds that produce
it with great Art.- For though the
Land is rocky, yet it has soft
layers in it, in which the treasure
is found.- whence the miners separate
it, melt it & purify it."-
- But in proportion as Tin
ore became more rare in the
beds of rivers, & in the lowlands,
the search for it as extended
into the soil that covers the
hills, & the original veins
were in consequence discovered,
& the manner of tracing them
by their detached productions
has been ever since in common
use.-

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00019|dnp04a419pp|88271062[/page]
- Indications of Metallic Ores
are often furnished by the impregnations
in water issuing from the Springs in
metalliferous strata.- Impregnations
of [chemical]chemical_008|iron[/chemical], & of copper are the most
common, & the cupreous impregnation
may always be distinguished by
exposing [chemical]chemical_008|iron[/chemical] or steel to the fluid.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- A remarkable instance of the
discovery of Metallic veins from
these circumstances, lately occurred
in North Wales.- At the foot
of a hill near Dolgethly, the
water is highly impregnated with
a salt of copper; so highly, that
the peat of a bog, into which it
has discharged itself, is sufficiently
loaded with the metal to afford
it advantageously by burning.-

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00020|dnp04a420pp|88271063[/page]
- When I was on the spot
in June 1805, I observed that
the vegetation was considerably
injured upon the course of the
Springs, & the only plant that
seemed to flourish near them
was the Statice. All the
circumstances appeared to point
out distinctly the directions of the
veins & I have been informed,
that by pursuing the indications,
a considerable copper mine, has
been discovered, & is now
advantageously worked.-
- Wherever in a mining Country
indeed, peculiar spots unnaturally
sterile are perceived, there is great
reason to suppose that the effect
has some connexion with the
presence of veins of Copper or of [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical].-

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00021|dnp04a421pp|88271064[/page]

- The effects of metallic impregnations
in destroying vegetation, is evident
from the general barrenness &
dreariness of mining districts, than
which nothing can well be conceived
more disagreeable to the eye.-
[deletion]- I shall shew a sketch of a[/deletion]
[deletion]mining Country near Redruth in[/deletion]
[deletion]Cornwall.[/deletion]
[underline]Instance.[/underline]
- No plants, except short & dark
green or brown furze; & a heath
that has scarcely sufficient vigour
to produce flowers.- And this
happens generally; |_ [underline]Where[/underline] great
treasures are found below the
surface, there is neither fertility
nor beauty above.- And the
lines which Poet
has unjustly applied to the most

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00022|dnp04a422pp|88271065[/page]
picturesque, if not the most fertile
part of Britain, may with propriety
be quoted with regard to such
a spot as [deletion]this[/deletion]. the mining districts
of cornwal.
"Far as the eye could reach, no tree was seen,
Earth clad in russet, scorned the lively green;
The plague of Locusts, they secure defy,
For in three hours a grasshopper must die."
- There is an idea particularly
prevalent amongst the Cornish Miners,
that metallic veins are sometimes
indicated by the appearance
of fires in the night, over the
places in which they exist.- This
notion has been generally considered
as a mere delusion.- but I am
convinced from many observations,
that it is not without foundation:
it is easy to assign a reason for
the phenomenon.- The metallic ores

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00023|dnp04a423pp|88271066[/page]
are for the most part perfect conductors
of Electricity, & when the Atmosphere
is highly [deletion]loaded with[/deletion] Electrical [deletion]matter,[/deletion]
the slow discharge of it, when it takes
place above metallic veins, must
necessarily produce a luminous
appearance on their surfaces.-
- This indication however, is as
likely to apply to pyrites or refractory
[chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical] ore, as to the ores of Copper
or Silver; & the former substances,
are much the most abundant in
nature.-
- Of the numerous mysterious
practices, supposed to be connected
with the discovery of Mines, almost
the only relict is, the search by the
divining Rod, & the belief in this
is rapidly going out of fashion, even
amongst the common Miners.-

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00024|dnp04a424pp|88271067[/page]
- The divining Rod is a forked stick
of hazel, which when held horizontally,
a branch being in each hand, was
supposed to be attracted by Metals.-
- Most of the ancient writers on
Metallurgy, have given long Theories
to account for the efficacy of the rod,
& even as late as 1778, M[superscript]r[/superscript].. Pryce
in his "History of the Cornish Mines",
states his full belief in its powers;
And explains them by supposing that
certain steams or vapours, rise from mines;
though he does not make it very clear,
why the hazel & no other substance
should have such a particular
affection for these effluvia.-
- The divining rod, it is well
known, is applied to the discovery
of Springs of water, as well as of
metallic veins; & there are
very respectable & excellent Persons

[page]25|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00025|dnp04a425pp|88271068[/page]
7
who believe in this power, & that they
themselves are capable of exercising it.
- Nothing should be disbelieved,
because it is marvellous, because
it does not coincide with our received
opinions.- The business of Philosophy
is to investigate [underline]causes[/underline].- A few
years ago, the fall of stones from
above, appeared a mere fable,
yet accurate observation has confirmed
the fact by a collection of testimonies
that it is impossible for a candid
mind to question.- A very
few observations, will be sufficient
to enlighten this subject of the
divining Rod; to shew what
is possible; & what must of
necessity be unfounded.-
- There are Persons so
susceptible of Electrical impressions

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00026|dnp04a426pp|88271069[/page]
as to be affected by the approach
of a thunder storm with peculiar
unpleasant sensations; or even
by the excitement of a common
machine:- And large masses of
metallic substances, & a moist
stratum of Earth, being Conductors
of Electricity, will necessarily influence
the electrical state of the atmosphere;
& may produce [underline]an effect[/underline], on very
delicate organs, possibly a peculiar
sensation on the surface of the Skin.-
- But the bending of the hazel twig,
can only be produced by the muscular
power of the hands:- The inert
vegetable fibres can not be
made to twist round either by
weak Electricity, or moisture,
or metallic steams.- This
effect is merely connected
either with a real or an

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00027|dnp04a427pp|88271070[/page]
imaginary impression on the nerves,
which might be as easily associated
with the twisting of the fingers, or
closing the Eyelids, or any other
arbitary muscular motion.-
- Again, there is generally
a false idea with respect to the
manner in which water exists below
the surface.- It is vulgarly supposed
that it fills cavities in the Earth;
whereas in all common cases, it is
merely distributed through a stratum
of gravel, or sand, or clay; & there
is no collection of water, till an
excavation is made, & the central
part of the moist stratum is the
part where the water would most
readily collect; but water would
likewise flow into any Cavity made
in any part of the Stratum, so

[page]28|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00028|dnp04a428pp|88271074[/page]
that the idea of selecting a particular
limited spot for water is absurd;
& at a certain depth below the
surface, water may always be
found.-
- A vein or a mass of metal,
is much more definite & limited;
yet the divining rod usually fails
applied to this mode of discovery;
& if there be sensations connected
with the Electrical effects of
Conductors below the surface,
they must be of a very uncertain
kind, & foreign influences,
particularly those of atmospheric
changes, must materially
interfere with them.-
- There was a very few
years ago, a Saxon Adventurer,
who travelled through England

professing to be able to discover precious
ores by the hazel: He deceived &
deluded several credulous people;
& left the Country with a considerable
sum of Money, which I believe was
the only way, in which He proved the
existence of the attraction between his rod
& the precious metals.-
[underline]tractors[/underline].
- I trust that what I have said
will not offend the feelings of any
individual.- To remove erroneous
ideas, & to discover truth is equally
an object of Science.-
Prejudices, & false opinions respecting
the powers of Nature are not merely
baneful in their relations to
philosophy, but likewise in their
common effects upon the mind

of feeling depend upon [underline]truth[/underline]; One
false view leads to another. Every
exercise of the reason, strengthens the
habit of correct thinking, & adds
something to the influence & power
of common sense.-
- I spoke of Tin Ore as discovered
& worked at a very early period
of the History of the World.-
This is a very remarkable circumstance;
for tin is never found native, &
has the Character of a stone; & is
difficultly reducible. - It is not
improbable that an accident
similar to that described by
Lucretius led to the discovery;
a fire kindled upon a vein
of the ore.- "A powerful

[page]31|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00031|dnp04a431pp|88271077[/page]
- "A powerful fire, above the hidden vein,
Disclosed to Man, rich Nature's glittering store;
And taught him how to use the ponderous ore:
And on the mass whilst yet in fusion warm,
Impress the destined, & the useful form."-
- Silver, Gold, & Copper are found
native.- Probably the first [chemical]chemical_008|iron[/chemical] worked,
was meteoric iron, similar to that
found in Siberia & South America;
& similar to that which fell in
Hindostan about 150 years ago.
- [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical] was known in the time of
Homer, for the effect of the burning
brand thrust by Ulysses into the
eye of Polyphemus, is compared to
the effect of red hot [chemical]chemical_008|iron[/chemical] plunged
into water by the Smith.- In
a later period we are informed
by Theophrastus that the [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical] in

Greece, was manufactured by means
of pit Coal found in [place]place_1025|Elis[/place], & near
Olympias.-
- The Greeks seem to have been
acquainted with almost all the
metals known till within the
last 200 years, when Chemistry
became an object of Scientific
pursuit.- The description of the
Shield of Achilles, proves the early
use of many of them, & shews
their early application to the
purposes of the fine Arts.-
- If indeed it can be conceived
the the descriptions of this great
[person]person_035|Poet of Nature[/person], & of passion, were
founded upon existing models,
the highest opinion must be formed
of the powers & skill of the more
ancient Grecian Artists.- And even

allowing that a brilliant imagination
may have depicted fancied excellence,
yet it is impossible to withold our
wonder in considering the advanced
State of the metallurgical Arts as
connected with Sculpture & Design,
in a Country so lately emerged from

to the discovery of truth.-
- Accustomed in the Animal
& Vegetable Kingdoms to associate
increase & decay, with every species
of regularity of form: the Mind
is easily seduced into the notion
the the crystallizations found
beneath the surface of the Earth,
follow a similar Law; & this
notion becomes strengthened, by
the facts that are daily occurring
& that are capable of being
artificially exhibited, of the
gradual formation of [underline]regular Solids[/underline]

- The idea of the constant production
of Metals in veins, has not been a
mere error of the vulgar: It has
been sanctioned by high authority;
& defended by all the processes
that the first School of Chemistry
could supply. -
- Beccher whose reputation as
a Chemical Philosopher is deservedly
high, on this subject, seems to
have thought with less than his
usual acuteness. - He had
volatilized in some peculiar
combination, a quantity of [chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical];
& reasoning from that aphorism,
which seems uniformly to have
guided him. - That the principal
operations of Nature were capable

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00036|dnp04a436pp|88271088[/page]
of being imitated by Art.- He
concluded that the Metals were
continually produced by vapours
which rose from the interior of
the Earth; & which by acting
on the Stoney substances in the
different veins, transmuted them
into ores.-
- Henckel the first Mineralogist
who gave Celebrity to the Saxon
School, about 30 years after the
death of Beccher, advanced a
similar opinion.- He supposed
that Metals were principally of
late origin, & that they were
produced by fermentations going
on, in the different Strata.-
- Even Lehman, in general
distinct in his views, & cautious
in his hypotheses, was misled
with regard to the subject of veins;

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00037|dnp04a437pp|88271089[/page]
10
& he supposed that they were all connected
in one great trunk, hidden deep in
the bosom of the Earth: & that the
metals were continually formed in them;
& that they were composed & produced
by different arrangements of the same
elements, acted upon by Air & the
heat of the Sun.-
- These opinions are the remains
of the dreams of Alchemy, so
reluctantly given up.- Men after
having failed in their attempts to
transmute other metals into Gold,
had still some satisfaction in
imagining, that this effect took
place in the grand operations
of the Subterraneous Laboratory,
& some faint glimmerings of hope
were preserved with regard to a
more perfect Chemical Art; by
which this great secret of Nature,

[page]38|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00038|dnp04a438pp|88271090[/page]
should be disclosed & her processes
imitated. -
- There are a number of facts
which prove that some of the metallic
ores in veins, acted on by air, are
capable of being dissolved by water; 
& deposited from it in new forms. - 
- It is evident from the views
that have been developed, that
veins must be very irregular in
their dispositions & ramifications,
& that they must deviate in
various ways from the perpendiculars,
& that they can never be expected
rectilinear or equable through
the whole of their course. - There
is however a certain general order
of direction, which must have been
connected with the similarity
of the causes by which they were
produced. -

[page]39|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00039|dnp04a439pp|88271091[/page]
- Most of the great veins that afford
Gold & Silver in South America are said
to have a direction from East to West.-
- Some of the principal veins in Hungary
& Transylvania run from North East
to South West.- But in Britain,
the greatest metalliferous veins, all have
their course within a few points from
East to West.-
- This is equally the case in the primitive
& in the Secondary districts.- In
Cornwall, in Devonshire, & in Argyleshire,
in Cumberland, Northumberland &
Durham.-

- From the sketch it may be seen
that the principal veins run very near
upon the point of junction between
the shist & the granite.-

- In the secondary Country of the North
of England, the metalliferous veins
which contain very little of any other
metal, than [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical], have a similar
[underline]direction[/underline].-
- There are however, in every
part of the Island, some veins
which have a course from North
to South; & from North East to
South East; but they rarely contain
any metallic ores, & they almost
always intersect the other veins

- It often happens that where
the cross [underline]veins[/underline] cut [underline]the other veins[/underline],
the direction is unaltered: & the

on the other side.- But it [underline]sometimes[/underline]
[underline]occurs[/underline], that [underline]where[/underline] the intersection
takes place, there is a considerable
change in the position [underline]of the strata[/underline];
as if the force applied to produce
the fissure filled by the cross vein
had acted laterally, so as to remove
one part of [underline]the rock[/underline]; the part
containing the [underline]first vein[/underline] to a distance
[underline]from the other part[/underline].-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- This appearance is called by the
Cornish Miners, [underline]the heaving of the lode.[/underline]
And where it occurs in the working of
Mines, it is sometimes a very difficult
task to find the disunited & displaced
vein.-
- When the cross veins, or as they
are sometimes called Dykes, [deletion]are Basaltic[/deletion];
of a Country, are Basaltic, the
arrangement of their parts is very peculiar;
they are usually split into prisms of which

[page]42|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00042|dnp04a442pp|88271094[/page]
there are many varieties; & these
prisms, unlike the prisms of the
stratified Basalt, are always
parallel to the horizon.-
- A picture will best illustrate

pillars from it.-
- This peculiar difference, I conceive,
may be explained. - but I shall
waive till the general hypothesis
is developed, all partial statements.-
I am now attempting to be the historian
of facts.-
- The pitchstone & Basaltic veins
are amongst the latest formations
in the Subterraneous Kingdom.-
And from their intersection of metallic
veins in all cases, where they occur
in the same Country:- We may
consider the fact as established;

[page]43|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00043|dnp04a443pp|88271095[/page]
that the metallic Ores are neither
produced nor renovated by any of the
operations now going on at the surface
of the Globe.-
- I make this Statement, because
the contrary opinion, is most prevalent
amongst Miners.- To the Philosophers
of the present day, the truth is
perfectly familiar.-
- I have often heard Miners assert,
that in the depths of Mines, which
had been exhausted, after a great
number of years, new ore had
been found accumulated
Dispute [underline]between two miners[/underline] in
[underline]Derbyshire[/underline].-
- Silver ore at the great vein of
Konsberg in Norway is thus taken up,
& crystallizes in another combination
upon the wood employed in the Mine:
& M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatchett has shewn that pyrites

is capable of being formed by the agency
of fluid, containing its constituent
parts.-
- But these phenomena admit of no
distinct application to the great
metallic veins.- They are
the productions of an ancient &
obscure period: & almost all
of them, exhibit proofs of having
been formed at an era, when
the ocean overspread the surface
of the present land: |_And the
discussion of the causes of their
formation, is a kindred subject
to that of the formation of the
Secondary rocks.- [deletion]I shall again[/deletion]

- In the[deletion]Chemical[/deletion] Lectures [insertion]of tomorrow[/insertion], I brought
[deletion]forwards[/deletion] [insertion]I shall bring forward[/insertion] some arguments, which render
it probable, that the metals are
compounds, & that the real
indestructible elements belonging
to our Globe are very few.- The
sublime & transcendental part of
Chemistry, respecting the real
composition of bodies, is still in its
infancy. - It is from the progress
of this Science, that the lights
must be derived, which are to
illumine the obscurity of all
Theories, respecting the formations
of the subterraneous mineral kingdom.
- Till the nature of the acting
bodies, is certainly known, it is in
vain to attempt to develope the
Laws of their operations.-
- Thunder & Lightning were
explained by the Ancients, on the idea

[page]46|MS-DAVY-10404-000-00046|dnp04a446pp|88271098[/page]
of the collision of Clouds.- The
early Philosophers of the Baconian
School, attributed them to the
kindling of exhalations & inflammable
vapours.- A new agency was
developed, & Franklin proved
that Electricity produced the
phenomena; & that the most
powerful of material agents, might
be divested of its terrors.-
-The Motions of the heavenly
Bodies, were accounted for, 200
years ago, by affections, or by
vortices of Ether.- A few facts

& simple Law of Gravitation.-
- Geology is a Science in
immaturity - Let facts be
collected for its foundations; &
