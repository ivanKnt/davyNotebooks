Lecture 5.
Geology 1811.
In the preceding Lectures, the solid parts
of the surface of the Globe have been considered
in what may be regarded as their states
of permanency; in their great & general
arrangements. - 
It has been seen that the foundations
of our Earth are constituted by immense
irregular masses of consolidated materials
of different kinds, affording the variety of
Mountain, valley, Hill & Plain: forming
the basins of the Ocean, & of lakes & the
beds of rivers, & intersected by veins
containing the metallic ores & other substances
which have been made subservient to the
purposes & comforts of Man. -
The natural order of investigation,
leads to the examination of the [underline]Laws[/underline] of
the [underline]alterations[/underline] of the surface of the Globe;
to an enquiry concerning "the powers by
which the Mechanism of Nature is preserved." -
- Change is the characteristic of all
terrestrial things; & the most refined
 Philosophy of the subject, consists, in tracing
the order of events, by which [underline]Change[/underline]
is made subservient to the harmony of our
system, & to the purposes of Life. -
