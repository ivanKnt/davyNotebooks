& subterraneous fires, seem to be connected
with the agency of Heat, Electricity, Air,
& water, in the solid materials of
the Globe. -
- Gravitation & Cohesion, tend to
preserve the [underline]permanency[/underline] of the System;
Heat, Electricity, & Chemical attraction,
are constantly disposing its elements, to
new arrangements: But the opposing
powers are balanced, their equilibrium
is preserved, & though the parts
continually change, the whole appears
immutable. -
- It will be necessary to illustrate
these general ideas, by particular
instances, & to shew in what manner
so many different causes co-operate
in producing a joint effect
- Rocks in their interior preserve
a temperature which is about the mean
temperature of the Atmosphere, but
superficially there is a continual
variation. - Their parts in general
are non-elastic, but are expanded by
heat, & contracted by Cold. - And
such agencies operating, in the long course
of Ages, there is every reason to believe,
must at last alter the texture of the
surface, & diminish the aggregation
of its parts. -
