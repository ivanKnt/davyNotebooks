- Take, for instance, a mass of Grauwacke
or Trap, composed of parts, unequally
expansible, suppose it cooled in [insertion]a[/insertion] March
night to 32°, the freezing point. -
In the Morning by the Sun beams, the
degree may be raised to 60° on the surface,
whilst the interior remains unaffected. -
this would occasion a considerable expansion,
which must tend on the common Laws of
Mechanics, to separate, or at least to
diminish the [underline]cohesion between[/underline] the exterior
& the interior parts. -
This cause however can scarcely ever
exert an independent operation; And
it is usually connected with what
may be called the expansive agency
of water. -
- All Rocks in proportion as their
texture is more or less solid, are less
or more permeable to moisture; &
even the hardest & most crystallized
have pores susceptible of receiving it.
- This piece of compact Limestone is
apparently dry, another piece of the same
kind, & as free from moisture is acted
upon by Heat - vapour is given out
from it, I perceive it distinctly.
Instance
& this moisture existed in its pores & was
derived from the atmosphere
- The case would be similar
