with any other Rock, but the quantity would
differ in different specimens. Soft sandstone
would produce more than limestone. -
Shist more than Serpentine; & the
secondary soft granite, more than the
primary hard granite, which, least
of all exhibits this property. -
- The water found in Cavities of
the interior of [underline]many[/underline] stones, particularly
 of Basalt, seems to be owing to their
permeability to the moisture of the
Atmosphere. - I have seen a loose
columnar Basalt near Portrush, in
the North of Ireland, which when
broken, affords considerable portions
of water, which has all the characters
of rain water, & that its texture
is permeable to vapour, I proved
by a very simple experiment. -
A small column was broken into
two parts - one immediately examined
afforded cavities, almost all of which
were filled with water, the other
was kept under a fireplace, for two
or three days, where the temperature
must have been often about that
of the boiling point of water. -
there was no explosion, or mechanical
disintegration of the stone, but when
it was [underline]broken, no water[/underline] was found,
it all [underline]had [deletion]evaporated[/deletion] escaped[/underline] through
the pores, in consequence of the
evaporating agency of Heat. -
