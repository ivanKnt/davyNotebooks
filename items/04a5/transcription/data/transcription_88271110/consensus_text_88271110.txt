- (In the great series of Natural
operations, [underline]the moisture[/underline] included in stones,
or adhering to their surfaces in a fluid
form, has its volume altered by every
 change of temperature, in a much greater
degree, than the Stoney matter.
- The sudden impression of heat from
the Sun beams, causes it to expand, &
this expansion must be usually connected
with a slight alteration in the texture
of the Rock. -
When the water is converted into ice,
there is a still greater enlargement of
its volume, the surface in this case
when fully permeated with fluid, is
often separated into parts, & the whole
arrangement destroyed. -
- The destructive operation of ice is
particularly distinct upon those rocks, which
present in their Character as masses, small
& numerous apertures - in which the sides
are so approximated as to admit of the
adhesion of water. - [underline][deletion]Grauwacke[/deletion] Shist.[/underline]

In Granite for instance, the blocks are
usually too large, & the orifices too wide
to admit of the agency, but in porphyry,
in Shist, in Serpentine, & in Marble,
there is in the transverse fractures a
space, & such rocks are often [underline]considerably[/underline]
changed, & degraded, even in a single
winter by the operation of ice.
