- In the great mass of primitive
Granite, which forms the Land's End in Cornwall
there have been scarcely any instances
remembered of degradation, - but the
Shist of Cape Cornwall to the West of it
scarcely a season passes, without producing
considerable alterations of the surface
exposed to the Sea - And the case
[deletion]must be[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] similar in the Serpentine
of the Lizard. The shelving
nature of the upper part of the
Shistose & Serpentine Cliffs, & the
immense fragments forming their
bases, announce in a distinct
language, the gradual decay of
their surfaces & the cause that
has been stated, is certainly a
prime cause.
- For the same reasons that Shist,
& Serpentine are more decomposable
by the expansive agency of water
than Granite, the secondary Rocks
generally speaking are more destructible
than the primary - From their looser
texture, from their stratified forms;
& the nature of their fracture they
easily yield to this species of agency
Instance Mamtor, or the Shivery
Mountain in Derbyshire. -
- (The [underline]extensive[/underline] dissolving [underline]powers[/underline]
of [underline]water[/underline] are much more generally
known, than its expansive energies
