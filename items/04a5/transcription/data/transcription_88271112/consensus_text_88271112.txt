as resulting from temperature & these
powers operate to a great extent in the
 Mineral Kingdom, & are constant sources
of the decomposition of Rocks.
- The Solution of siliceous & aluminous
earth by the heated & slightly alkalized
waters of Volcanic Springs, was referred
to in a former lecture. - Silex & alumine
are little acted [insertion]upon[/insertion], but few stones contain
them pure, & lime [deletion]& magnesia are[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion]
exceedingly soluble in water, particularly
when it holds in solution carbonic acid
or fixed air. -
- The [underline]Water[/underline] poured down from the
Atmosphere in rain, or mist or in dew
is uniformly combined with certain portions
of this Elastic substance. And it acts
on stones containing calcareous matter
& on the calcareous Earths when it
exists in loose combination, as a
constituent part of compound Rocks. -
- The water that flows through
Limestone Strata uniformly carries
with it in solution, a certain portion
of carbonate of lime: And the
feldspar & the Shiller spar of Serpentine
are often de[deletion]m[/deletion][insertion]c[/insertion]ons[deletion]trated[/deletion][insertion]posed[/insertion], in consequence
of the [underline]solution of small quantities[/underline] of the
[underline]calcareous & magnesian earth[/underline] that
they [underline]contain[/underline]
- At the foot of Cader Idris in
N. Wales, there is a rock of Grauwacke,
the basis of which is partly calcareous,
