Instance
- There are many Rocks which
contain in some of their parts a fixed
alkali as a Chemical Element. - &
this substance acted on by the carbonic
acid (which as has been shewn in former
lectures always exists in Air) has
its affinity for the earths destroyed -
& in its state of union with carbonic
acid, it is highly soluble in water. -
An exp[superscript]t[/superscript] will elucidate - & will
supply an analogy by which the fact
will appear more distinct. -

- Feldspar in the states in
which it has been minutely examined
has been discovered to contain fixed
alkali (& it has been shewn that
no substance is found in greater
abundance in Rocks. - It forms
