- In the Secondary Granites, porphyries,
& traps, the feldspar [underline]seems[/underline] to abound in
Potash, or the fixed vegetable alkali - And
the parts of these Rocks acted on by air &

Porcelain Clay of Cornwall. -
The porcelain Clay of Cornwall is from
a decomposing Granite, & the feldspar
& Mica remain unaltered & the Clay
is washed from them. -
I have analysed a specimen &

- Primitive Granites & Porphyries have
not been chemically analysed, there is here
great room for discoveries; Most likely
they would be found to contain little
or no alkali. -
- No principle is more generally
diffused in our Rocks & Stones than
oxide of iron. - It enters abundantly into
the composition of most of their elements
particularly hornblende mica & chlorite
& in its state of combination, it is
