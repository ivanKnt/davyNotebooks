will be usually exhibited, & the effect
is much more distinct when Clouds are
present & there is a Law of Electricity
by which all surfaces contiguous to
electrified bodies gain an opposite

And Electricity is a great agent of Chemical
change. This is exemplified in the
Voltaic apparatus, & has been explained
in the chemical Lectures

So that the surfaces of Rocks in a
moist state may undergo change, from
the tendency of Electricity to evolve some
of their principles & a gradual
decay & degradation would result
from such an operation. -
- (It is difficult to discriminate
accurately between the effects of all
these diversified agencies; & it is only
by the minute study of the aspect of
Rocks, that fair conclusions can be drawn. -
- In the [underline]same class of Rocks[/underline], a slight
variety in species, a minute difference
in chemical composition or in texture
will exceedingly affect the tendency to be
operated on, by the different powers
