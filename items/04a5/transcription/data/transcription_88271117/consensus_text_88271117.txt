of decomposition. - I have already
mentioned, that in general the
primary Granites, yield of all
rocks the least to the operation of
the external elements - & suffer
in the lapse of ages, only a slight
degradation of surface. but yet
I have seen a Granite apparently
primitive, [deletion]in Ireland[/deletion], [insertion]near Morton in Scotland[/insertion] which
being formed in smaller blocks
than usual, was in a state of
degradation, principally, I believe
from the agency of ice, of water
& of air. -
- Basalt from the form of its
fracture, & from the nature of
its composition (it containing lime,
soda iron & inflammable matter)
is in general exceedingly liable to
decay; - (Yet in Fingal's Cave &
at the Giant's Causeway, from the
compactness of texture of the
pillars - It wonderfully resists
decomposition. & no marks of
destruction can be perceived upon it. -
Whilst at [deletion]Bengavenee[/deletion] [insertion]Pleskin[/insertion] where the
pillars are looser in their texture,
it is in a continued state of
degradation.
