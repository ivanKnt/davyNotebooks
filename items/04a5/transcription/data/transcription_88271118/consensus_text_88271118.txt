- The causes of decomposition, (evidently
from what has been said,) must be
exceedingly influenced by [underline]Climate[/underline]. -
And in the temperate regions, a [underline]great[/underline]
[underline]cause[/underline], the inequality of heat
becomes almost [underline]inefficient[/underline]. - Yet
in this case even from the height
of the mean degree the chemical
agents of decay act perhaps more
powerfully & sooner or later, by
slow but [underline]sure operations[/underline], the
purposes of Nature are attained. -
- The causes of the decomposition
of Rocks are wonderfully complex,
the [underline]effects[/underline] are exceedingly simple,
& the end obvious. - The finely
divided matter on the surface becomes
a [underline]soil[/underline] - (From the decomposing
agencies assisted by the force of
[underline]Gravitation[/underline], rude precipices & Crags
before inaccessible, become gentle
slopes (& sooner or later the [underline]surface[/underline]
is prepared to become the abode
of [underline]vegetable life[/underline].
- As soon as the Rock begins to
be softened - the seeds of lichens, which
are constantly [underline]floating in the air[/underline], make
it their resting place. Their generations
occupy it, till a finely divided Earth
is formed, which becomes capable of
supporting mosses & heath. -
