plants drink in the [underline]dew[/underline] & convert
the constituent parts of the air into
nourishment: - Their death &
decay afford food for a more
perfect species of vegetable, & at
length a [underline]mould[/underline] is formed, in
which even the Trees of the Forest
can fix [underline]their[/underline] roots, & which is
[underline]capable[/underline] of rewarding the labours
of the [underline]cultivator[/underline]. -
- The greater part of the surface
of the Globe must have become
the bed of vegetation, soon after
the Epoch of the formation of
the Secondary Rocks; (but [underline]since[/underline]
that period, the materials of soils
must have been often changed.
& that even in cases when they
have remained in their natural
state. -
- The fertility of Soils is determined
in a great measure by climate, by
situation & their relation to moisture.
And the most productive lands in
 different parts of the Globe, & in
different latitudes, [underline]differ very much[/underline],
in composition. -
- But in general it may be said
in considering their Chemical nature,
that the Soils of basaltic & calcareous
Countries are the most fertile. -
