defend the surface below them from a new
action of the Elements, & prevent to a
great extent any further decay, & by the
agency of their [underline]roots[/underline] they preserve the
light & finely divided Earth from being
carried away by rains, or scattered by
winds - Vegetables likewise
accumulate considerable proportions of their
inflammable matter from the Carbonic acid
in the Atmosphere & from water -
Trees decaying in their natural state, -
from the common directions of currents
of air or winds, against the ridge or in
[underline]front of[/underline] Hills and Mountains usually fall
with their branches towards the summit -
& the power of vegetation to collect &
elevate [underline]solid matter[/underline] is fully shewn
in the formation & increase of peat
mosses
- Amidst the changes produced
during the long succession of Ages, in
the solid parts of the Earth, there
seems to be still the [underline]same grand[/underline]
relation [underline]between them[/underline]
- The small [deletion]ine[/deletion]qua[deletion]l[/deletion][insertion]nt[/insertion]ities of solid
matter carried into the Sea, seem[deletion]s[/deletion]
to be fully compensated for by the
effects of vegetation & of volcanic
fires; a subject which will be fully
discussed in the next Lecture. -
