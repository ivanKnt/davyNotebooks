It will be [deletion]further[/deletion] [insertion]then[/insertion] seen that whilst the
arrangements of Matter are continually modified
Its great forms are unalterable . -
in the grand Cycle of Events, nothing
can be said to be accidental, or without
design. -
The principles in the Earth, the
Sea & the Air are in continued
circulation, And their change is
constantly made subservient to the
permanency of Life. -
 "By ceaseless [underline]motion[/underline], all that is Subsists:
Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel
That Nature rides upon - maintains
Her health, her beauty, her fertility
She dreads a moments pause - and
Lives but while she moves. -
- Its own revolvency upholds the World.
Winds from all quarters agitate the Air
And fit the limpid element for use
Else noxious - Oceans, rivers, lakes & streams,
All feel the freshening impulse - All are cleansed
By countless undulations." -
