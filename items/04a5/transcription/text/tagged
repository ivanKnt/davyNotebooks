Lecture 5.
Geology 1811.
In the preceding Lectures, the solid parts
of the surface of the Globe have been considered
in what may be regarded as their states
of permanency; in their great & general
arrangements. - 
It has been seen that the foundations
of our Earth are constituted by immense
irregular masses of consolidated materials
of different kinds, affording the variety of
Mountain, valley, Hill & Plain: forming
the basins of the Ocean, & of lakes & the
beds of rivers, & intersected by veins
containing the metallic ores & other substances
which have been made subservient to the
purposes & comforts of Man. -
The natural order of investigation,
leads to the examination of the [underline]Laws[/underline] of
the [underline]alterations[/underline] of the surface of the Globe;
to an enquiry concerning "the powers by
which the Mechanism of Nature is preserved." -
- Change is the characteristic of all
terrestrial things; & the most refined
 Philosophy of the subject, consists, in tracing
the order of events, by which [underline]Change[/underline]
is made subservient to the harmony of our
system, & to the purposes of Life. -

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00002|dnp04a502pp|88271105[/page]
In taking a view of the alterations
of the Globe, connected with Geology, it
is necessary to examine all the circumstances
that can operate, & all the agents
 concerned, whether Chemical or Mechanical. -
- Our Globe, by a beautiful, &
wonderfully intelligent arrangement,
is made to revolve round its own
axis, & round the Sun, in such
a manner, that its different parts
are unequally supplied with light
& heat: that changes of temperature
are continually taking place, & all
the variety of Seasons is produced. -
- The difference of the influence of
the Sun, is a prime mover, in all
terrestrial alterations, & this influence
acts immediately, & likewise by
increasing the energy of the effects of
water & air upon the solid parts
of the Earth. -
- All water is ultimately derived
from the Ocean, which occupies nearly
2/3 of the surface of the Globe, &
which according to the calculations of
[person]person_130|La Place[/person] cannot possess a mean depth
of less than four Miles. -
Acted on by the attractions of the
Sun & Moon, this great body of fluid
is agitated by Tides - It is kept

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00003|# HD_4_A_5_03.tif|[/page]
in motion likewise by Winds - & moisture
raised by heat in an invisible form from
its surface, is condensed in the colder
regions of the Atmosphere, & poured
down in rain, mist or dew, becoming
the origin of rivers, & affording the
supply of lakes, & returning in constant
circulation to its parent source. -
- The Atmosphere in which we breathe
& move, & which every where invelopes
the surface, is an immense body of elastic
matter, extending to at least 40 miles
above the Earth. It is extremely moveable
in its parts, & susceptible of the impression
of heat. - The currents arising from its
motions, constitue Winds. One of its
elements is the most active substance in
nature; & it is equally subservient to
the purposes of vitality, in its direct
operation upon living Beings, & in its
more remote effects on the surface which
they inhabit. -
The Atmosphere is the great Theatre of
Electrical Changes; the grandeur &
magnificence of which are displayed
in the thunder Storm; & which are
efficient in a more tranquil series of
operations, belonging to the daily & constant
Order of Events. -
- All the phenomena of Geological
changes, & amongst them, even, Earthquakes

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00004|dnp04a504pp|88271107[/page]
& subterraneous fires, seem to be connected
with the agency of Heat, Electricity, Air,
& water, in the solid materials of
the Globe. -
- Gravitation & Cohesion, tend to
preserve the [underline]permanency[/underline] of the System;
Heat, Electricity, & Chemical attraction,
are constantly disposing its elements, to
new arrangements: But the opposing
powers are balanced, their equilibrium
is preserved, & though the parts
continually change, the whole appears
immutable. -
- It will be necessary to illustrate
these general ideas, by particular
instances, & to shew in what manner
so many different causes co-operate
in producing a joint effect
- Rocks in their interior preserve
a temperature which is about the mean
temperature of the Atmosphere, but
superficially there is a continual
variation. - Their parts in general
are non-elastic, but are expanded by
heat, & contracted by Cold. - And
such agencies operating, in the long course
of Ages, there is every reason to believe,
must at last alter the texture of the
surface, & diminish the aggregation
of its parts. -

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00005|dnp04a505pp|88271108[/page]

- Take, for instance, a mass of [chemical]chemical_099|grauwacke[/chemical]
or [chemical]chemical_347|Trap[/chemical], composed of parts, unequally
expansible, suppose it cooled in [insertion]a[/insertion] March
night to 32°, the freezing point. -
In the Morning by the Sun beams, the
degree may be raised to 60° on the surface,
whilst the interior remains unaffected. -
this would occasion a considerable expansion,
which must tend on the common Laws of
Mechanics, to separate, or at least to
diminish the [underline]cohesion between[/underline] the exterior
& the interior parts. -
This cause however can scarcely ever
exert an independent operation; And
it is usually connected with what
may be called the expansive agency
of water. -
- All Rocks in proportion as their
texture is more or less solid, are less
or more permeable to moisture; &
even the hardest & most crystallized
have pores susceptible of receiving it.
- This piece of compact [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] is
apparently dry, another piece of the same
kind, & as free from moisture is acted
upon by Heat - vapour is given out
from it, I perceive it distinctly.
Instance
& this moisture existed in its pores & was
derived from the atmosphere
- The case would be similar

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00006|dnp04a506pp|88271109[/page]
with any other Rock, but the quantity would
differ in different specimens. Soft [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical]
would produce more than [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]. -
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] more than [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical]; & the
secondary soft [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], more than the
primary hard [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], which, least
of all exhibits this property. -
- The water found in Cavities of
the interior of [underline]many[/underline] stones, particularly
 of [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical], seems to be owing to their
permeability to the moisture of the
Atmosphere. - I have seen a loose
[chemical]chemical_223|columnar basalt[/chemical] near Portrush, in
the [place]place_437|North of Ireland[/place], which when
broken, affords considerable portions
of water, which has all the characters
of rain water, & that its texture
is permeable to vapour, I proved
by a very simple experiment. -
A small column was broken into
two parts - one immediately examined
afforded cavities, almost all of which
were filled with water, the other
was kept under a fireplace, for two
or three days, where the temperature
must have been often about that
of the boiling point of water. -
there was no explosion, or mechanical
disintegration of the stone, but when
it was [underline]broken, no water[/underline] was found,
it all [underline]had [deletion]evaporated[/deletion] escaped[/underline] through
the pores, in consequence of the
evaporating agency of Heat. -

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00007|dnp04a507pp|88271110[/page]
- |_ In the great series of Natural
operations, [underline]the moisture[/underline] included in stones,
or adhering to their surfaces in a fluid
form, has its volume altered by every
 change of temperature, in a much greater
degree, than the Stoney matter.
- The sudden impression of heat from
the Sun beams, causes it to expand, &
this expansion must be usually connected
with a slight alteration in the texture
of the Rock. -
When the water is converted into ice,
there is a still greater enlargement of
its volume, the surface in this case
when fully permeated with fluid, is
often separated into parts, & the whole
arrangement destroyed. -
- The destructive operation of ice is
particularly distinct upon those rocks, which
present in their Character as masses, small
& numerous apertures - in which the sides
are so approximated as to admit of the
adhesion of water. - [underline][chemical]chemical_099|[deletion]Grauwacke[/deletion][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical].[/underline]
[chemical]chemical_120|[underline]Shist[/underline][/chemical]
In [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] for instance, the blocks are
usually too large, & the orifices too wide
to admit of the agency, but in [chemical]chemical_125|porphyry[/chemical],
in [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical], in [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical], & in Marble,
there is in the transverse fractures a
space, & such rocks are often [underline]considerably[/underline]
changed, & degraded, even in a single
winter by the operation of ice.
[underline]Instance.[/underline]

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00008|dnp04a508pp|88271111[/page]
- In the great mass of primitive
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], which forms the [place]place_508|Land's End[/place] in [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place]
there have been scarcely any instances
remembered of degradation, - but the
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] of [place]place_523|Cape Cornwall[/place] to the West of it
scarcely a season passes, without producing
considerable alterations of the surface
exposed to the Sea - And the case
[deletion]must be[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] similar in the [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical]
of [place]place_509|The Lizard[/place]. The shelving
nature of the upper part of the
Shistose & [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical] Cliffs, & the
immense fragments forming their
bases, announce in a distinct
language, the gradual decay of
their surfaces & the cause that
has been stated, is certainly a
prime cause.
- For the same reasons that [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical],
& [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical] are more decomposable
by the expansive agency of water
than [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], the secondary Rocks
generally speaking are more destructible
than the primary - From their looser
texture, from their stratified forms;
& the nature of their fracture they
easily yield to this species of agency
Instance [place]place_1010|Mamtor[/place], or the Shivery
Mountain in [place]place_085|Derbyshire[/place]. -
- |_ The [underline]extensive[/underline] dissolving [underline]powers[/underline]
of [underline]water[/underline] are much more generally
known, than its expansive energies

[page]9|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00009|dnp04a509pp|88271112[/page]

as resulting from temperature & these
powers operate to a great extent in the
 Mineral Kingdom, & are constant sources
of the decomposition of Rocks.
- The Solution of siliceous & aluminous
earth by the heated & slightly alkalized
waters of Volcanic Springs, was referred
to in a former lecture. - [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical]
are little acted [insertion]upon[/insertion], but few stones contain
them pure, & [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] [deletion]& [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] are[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion]
exceedingly soluble in water, particularly
when it holds in solution [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
or fixed air. -
- The [underline]Water[/underline] poured down from the
Atmosphere in rain, or mist or in dew
is uniformly combined with certain portions
of this Elastic substance. And it acts
on stones containing calcareous matter
& on the calcareous Earths when it
exists in loose combination, as a
constituent part of compound Rocks. -
- The water that flows through
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] Strata uniformly carries
with it in solution, a certain portion
of [chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical]: And the
[chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] & the [chemical]chemical_405|Shiller spar[/chemical] of [chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical]
are often de[deletion]m[/deletion][insertion]c[/insertion]ons[deletion]trated[/deletion][insertion]posed[/insertion], in consequence
of the [underline]solution of small quantities[/underline] of the
[underline][chemical]chemical_081|Calcareous [/chemical]& magnesian earth[/underline] that
they [underline]contain[/underline]
- At the foot of [place]place_456|Cader Idris[/place] in
[place]place_436|N. Wales[/place], there is a rock of [chemical]chemical_099|grauwacke[/chemical],
the basis of which is partly calcareous,

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00010|dnp04a510pp|88271113[/page]
, & this rock wherever is has been
exposed to the agency of water, has
undergone decompositon. The soluble
material has been washed out from it,
& the remainder has formed a mass
which appears as a mixture of finely
divided siliceous sand & gravel. -
[underline]Interesting instance in [place]place_047|Donegal[/place].[/underline] -
Instance
- There are many Rocks which
contain in some of their parts a fixed
alkali as a Chemical Element. - &
this substance acted on by the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] (which as has been shewn in former
lectures always exists in Air) has
its affinity for the earths destroyed -
& in its state of union with [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical], it is highly soluble in water. -
An exp[superscript]t[/superscript] will elucidate - & will
supply an analogy by which the fact
will appear more distinct. -

- [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] in the states in
which it has been minutely examined
has been discovered to contain fixed
alkali (& it has been shewn that
no substance is found in greater
abundance in Rocks. - It forms
a constituent part of all Granites,
[chemical]chemical_125|Porphyries[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_347|traps[/chemical], [chemical]chemical_099|grauwackes[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_105|Basalts[/chemical];
& the alkali that it always

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00011|dnp04a511pp|88271114[/page]
contains in larger or smaller quantities, is
a general source of decomposition. -
- In the Secondary Granites, [chemical]chemical_125|Porphyries[/chemical],
& [chemical]chemical_347|traps[/chemical], the [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] [underline]seems[/underline] to abound in
[chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical], or the fixed vegetable alkali - And
the parts of these Rocks acted on by air &
water soon lo[deletion]o[/deletion]se their cohesion, the
[chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] [underline]is at last converted[/underline] into a fine
Clay; the [underline]alkali is washed[/underline] out, & the
earthy parts remain. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Porcelain Clay of [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place]. -
The porcelain Clay of [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place] is from
a decomposing [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], & the [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical]
& [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical] remain unaltered & the Clay
is washed from them. -
I have analysed a specimen &
- The porcelain Rock of [place]place_461|Anglesea[/place] is a
Porphyry - &
[underline]Instance[/underline].
- Primitive Granites & [chemical]chemical_125|Porphyries[/chemical] have
not been chemically analysed, there is here
great room for discoveries; Most likely
they would be found to contain little
or no alkali. -
- No principle is more generally
diffused in our Rocks & Stones than
[chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical]. - It enters abundantly into
the composition of most of their elements
particularly [chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_074|Chlorite[/chemical]
& in its state of combination, it is

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00012|dnp04a512pp|88271115[/page]
scarcely ever united to a full proportion
of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], or pure air
[underline]Instance[/underline].
green Sulphate of iron precip[superscript]d[/superscript] by [chemical]chemical_003|Am[/chemical]. -
- When Rocks in the process of decomposition
become yellow, or deep brown, the presence
of green [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] is amongst the causes
of their decomposition
there are many instances. -
[chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] -
[chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical].
- I noticed that in the last family
of the Secondary Rocks - Bituminous
& inflammable matters are sometimes
found - & these substances in their
combined states when exposed upon
a great surface to the action of water
& air seem susceptible of forming
new Compounds. -
[chemical]chemical_397|shale[/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]
May owe decomposition to these sources. -
- The chemical agencies of water
& of air so obvious in these cases
are in many instances assisted,
there is great reason to believe
by the operation of Electrical powers. -
Under all common circumstances, the
atmosphere is Electrical. If a School
boy's Kite be raised even in a clear

blue sky, having a card containing
metal attached to it, marks of Electricity
will be usually exhibited, & the effect
is much more distinct when Clouds are
present & there is a Law of Electricity
by which all surfaces contiguous to
electrified bodies gain an opposite
Electricity
[underline]Instance[/underline].
And Electricity is a great agent of Chemical
change. This is exemplified in the
[chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] apparatus, & has been explained
in the chemical Lectures
[underline]Instance[/underline].
So that the surfaces of Rocks in a
moist state may undergo change, from
the tendency of Electricity to evolve some
of their principles & a gradual
decay & degradation would result
from such an operation. -
- |_ It is difficult to discriminate
accurately between the effects of all
these diversified agencies; & it is only
by the minute study of the aspect of
Rocks, that fair conclusions can be drawn. -
- In the [underline]same class of Rocks[/underline], a slight
variety in species, a minute difference
in chemical composition or in texture
will exceedingly affect the tendency to be
operated on, by the different powers

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00014|dnp04a514pp|88271117[/page]
of decomposition. - I have already
mentioned, that in general the
primary Granites, yield of all
rocks the least to the operation of
the external elements - & suffer
in the lapse of ages, only a slight
degradation of surface. but yet
I have seen a [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] apparently
primitive, [deletion]in [place]place_018|Ireland[/place][/deletion], [insertion]near [place]place_1011|Morton[/place] in [place]place_235|Scotland[/place][/insertion] which
being formed in smaller blocks
than usual, was in a state of
degradation, principally, I believe
from the agency of ice, of water
& of air. -
- [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] from the form of its
fracture, & from the nature of
its composition (it containing [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical],
soda iron & inflammable matter)
is in general exceedingly liable to
decay; - |_ Yet in [place]place_1035|Fingal[/place]'s Cave &
at the [place]place_126|Giant's Causeway[/place], from the
compactness of texture of the
pillars - It wonderfully resists
decomposition. & no marks of
destruction can be perceived upon it. -
Whilst at [deletion]Bengavenee[/deletion] [insertion][place]place_479|Pleskin[/place][/insertion] where the
pillars are looser in their texture,
it is in a continued state of
degradation.

[page]15|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00015|dnp04a515pp|88271118[/page]
- The causes of decomposition, |_ evidently
from what has been said,) must be
exceedingly influenced by [underline]Climate[/underline]. -
And in the temperate regions, a [underline]great[/underline]
[underline]cause[/underline], the inequality of heat
becomes almost [underline]inefficient[/underline]. - Yet
in this case even from the height
of the mean degree the chemical
agents of decay act perhaps more
powerfully & sooner or later, by
slow but [underline]sure operations[/underline], the
purposes of Nature are attained. -
- The causes of the decomposition
of Rocks are wonderfully complex,
the [underline]effects[/underline] are exceedingly simple,
& the end obvious. - The finely
divided matter on the surface becomes
a [underline]soil[/underline] - |_ From the decomposing
agencies assisted by the force of
[underline]Gravitation[/underline], rude precipices & Crags
before inaccessible, become gentle
slopes |_ & sooner or later the [underline]surface[/underline]
is prepared to become the abode
of [underline]vegetable life[/underline].
- As soon as the Rock begins to
be softened - the seeds of lichens, which
are constantly [underline]floating in the air[/underline], make
it their resting place. Their generations
occupy it, till a finely divided Earth
is formed, which becomes capable of
supporting mosses & heath. -
Acted upon by light & heat, these

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00016|dnp04a516pp|88271119[/page]
plants drink in the [underline]dew[/underline] & convert
the constituent parts of the air into
nourishment: - Their death &
decay afford food for a more
perfect species of vegetable, & at
length a [underline]mould[/underline] is formed, in
which even the Trees of the Forest
can fix [underline]their[/underline] roots, & which is
[underline]capable[/underline] of rewarding the labours
of the [underline]cultivator[/underline]. -
- The greater part of the surface
of the Globe must have become
the bed of vegetation, soon after
the Epoch of the formation of
the Secondary Rocks; |_ but [underline]since[/underline]
that period, the materials of soils
must have been often changed.
& that even in cases when they
have remained in their natural
state. -
- The fertility of Soils is determined
in a great measure by climate, by
situation & their relation to moisture.
And the most productive lands in
 different parts of the Globe, & in
different latitudes, [underline]differ very much[/underline],
in composition. -
- But in general it may be said
in considering their Chemical nature,
that the Soils of [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] & calcareous
Countries are the most fertile. -

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00017|dnp04a517pp|88271120[/page]

- Their texture is equable, & of a proper
degree of permeability with regard to water.
- Some of [deletion]our[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] English [chemical]chemical_112|marles[/chemical] produce
alternately crops of wheat & beans
for years together, without manure. -
The soils in which mild [chemical]chemical_504|magnesian[line]earth[/chemical] is found are likewise productive. -
And the lands situated upon [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical],
particularly when their colour is red
which indicates the presence of much [chemical]chemical_166|oxide[line]of iron[/chemical], are in general more profitable
than the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] soils. -
- In the same district, & in similar
situations, a most important difference,
may be often observed in the nature
of the vegetables produced upon soils
differing in Chemical composition. -
Thus the [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] hills in [place]place_085|Derbyshire[/place]
produce only heath & peat moss,
whilst the [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] hills are usually
covered with short grass, & afford
a pasturage for Sheep. - & a similar
difference is observed between the
uncultivated [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] & shistose hills
of [place]place_162|Devonshire[/place] & [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place]; & the
Chalk strata of the [place]place_440|South Downs[/place] of
[place]place_1012|Dorseshire[/place] & [place]place_300|Wiltshire[/place]. -
[underline]Instance[/underline].
- Of all Soils, that produced
from the decay of large grained siliceous
[chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical], is the most difficult of
improvement - it affords no support

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00018|dnp04a518pp|88271121[/page]
for the roots of plants & it is often
transported by the wind, & altered
in surface & position. - The Soil
of [place]place_294|Bagshot Heath[/place] is of this kind. -
I have collected & analysed some
specimens of it & its texture
& composition indicate the extreme
of Barrenness.
[place]place_320|[deletion][underline]Norfolk[/underline][/deletion][/place] [place]place_1013|Cambridgeshire[/place]
- The siliceous sands of [place]place_161|Sussex[/place],
& of [place]place_320|Norfolk[/place] are of the same kind.
but much finer in texture - &
consequently more easily fertilized. -
In the arrangement of the Secondary
Strata, it is a happy circumstance
that there is an [underline]alternation[/underline] of
[underline]Rocks[/underline] |_ & the siliceous, aluminous,
& calcareous classes are seldom
very remote from each other. -
- No substance is so proper
for improving siliceous Sands as
[chemical]chemical_112|Marle[/chemical] or Chalk. - & they often
occur beneath the Sand Strata. -
- In [place]place_161|Sussex[/place] the Chalk Hills
of the [place]place_440|South Downs[/place] are immediately
connected with the Sand. - &
[chemical]chemical_112|Marle[/chemical] pits are abundant in [place]place_320|Norfolk[/place].
& in [place]place_028|Berkshire[/place]. - In such cases,
[underline]Sterility[/underline] serves to call forth the
energies of [underline]industry[/underline] & the factitious
soil produced by human labour
is often superior in fertility to that
which has owed its existence merely
to the operations of Nature. -

The variety of Rocks gives use to the
variety of soils; & different vegetables
grow to the greatest advantage in different
mixtures of the Earths. A denser & more
compact soil is required for grain, than
for bulbous roots; but in the same
district, almost all the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] varieties
occurs. |_ Nature, inexhaustible

- |_ By the decomposition of Rocks, Soils
are not merely [underline]produced[/underline]; but are
likewise renovated. - |_ From the agency
of water, there is often a transportation
of the materials of Mountains into vallies
& plains. -
- Those torrents that are the sources of
Rivers generally deposite the materials that
they have [underline]collected in the Mountains[/underline], on
the lower grounds - And whilst their beds
in the higher regions are becoming deeper
& narrower |_ in the Lowlands they are
constantly diminishing in depth, but

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00020|dnp04a520pp|88271123[/page]
increasing in extent - |_ by the
continual depositions of mountain
streams in [underline]Lakes[/underline] they gradually
diminish in size |_ & wherever accurate
observations have been made for a
 long course of years, the effect is
perfectly distinct. -
- The rivers which rise beneath
the Glaciers of [place]place_198|Switzerland[/place] are
almost uniformly turbid. The immense
masses of ice are in a continued state
of motion & of change. |_ And from
the melting of their lowest parts, a
declination or sliding down is produced. -
|_ In their progress , there is a constant
mechanical attrition of the strata
beneath |_ & the stream produced
from their thawing is loaded with
Earths, & [underline]stoney matters[/underline], reduced
into a state of minute division. -
- |_ The [place]place_355|Rhone[/place] rises below the
Glacier, which bears its name &
at its origin is turbid; but it
becomes clearer in its course, till
it receives the [place]place_945|Arve[/place], which is
exceedingly troubled |_ but all their
solid matter is deposited in the [place]place_241|Lake[line]of Geneva[/place], & the river flows out
perfectly limpid: & of a bright blue
green colour when seen by transmitted
light; & the beach of the [underline]Lake[/underline]
annually increases, at the [underline]place[/underline] where

it receives its supply of [underline]water[/underline]. -
Many analogous instances of the
diminution of Lakes are to be found in
this Country. - The Lakes of [place]place_453|Capel Curig[/place],
in [place]place_436|N. Wales[/place] are said to be constantly
diminishing: & the fact may be easily
illustrated by a sketch |_ which has
been already exhibited for the purpose
of shewing [place]place_451|the Snowdonian Chain[/place] of
[underline]Mountains[/underline]. -
[underline]Instance[/underline].
Dim. - Shores - junction torrents
from [place]place_790|Snowdon[/place]. -
- [place]place_1014|Derwentwater[/place] in [place]place_079|Cumberland[/place] affords
a similar instance. - There is great
reason to believe that this lake was
once joined to [place]place_1015|Bassenthwaite[/place], though
they are now more than a mile &
half asunder. - In the course
of one year only, I have had an
opportunity of observing myself a
considerable diminution in the upper
part of [place]place_1014|Derwentwater[/place]. - |_ Near the point
of [place]place_1016|the water fall of Lodore[/place] in 1804
I observed a deep & considerable pool,
but in 1805 I found it filled up by
gravel stones. Debris accumulated by
the winter torrents flowing through
[place]place_1017|Borrowdale[/place]. -
- Almost all the streams which

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00022|dnp04a522pp|88271125[/page]
feed the great Scotch Lakes are strongly
impregnated with vegetable matter.
& usually flow on, brown & turbid. -
But the streams that [underline]proceed[/underline] from
the Lakes are all of them much
 clearer. Thus [place]place_402|the Leven[/place] which
passes from [place]place_497|Loch Lomond[/place] is exceedingly
pellucid when compared with its
parent springs. -
- And the Awe, which flows
into [place]place_1018|Loch Awe[/place] [underline]perfectly brown[/underline] passes
out of it, scarcely tinted & the
greatest part of the solid matter
which was diffused through it, is
subservient to the slow increase
of the shores, & diminution of the
depth of the Lake. -

In this process of increasing the
Lowlands at the expence of the
mountains - |_ a certain quantity
of [underline]solid[/underline] matter is however carried
into the Sea - And whilst some
part of it is employed in raising low
Islands at the mouths of the great
rivers, yet another part is wafted
by currents into the depths of the
Ocean. -
- |_ The Delta has been produced
from the depositions of the Nile; &
at the entrance of the [place]place_518|Ganges[/place], a
number of small Islands have been
raised, from the accumulation of solid

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00023|dnp04a523pp|88271126[/page]
matter; but a portion of the debris
brought down by these great rivers must
have passed into the Sea, & must occupy
a place distant from the Shore . -
- It was the fact of the transportation
of solid materials from the Land into the
Sea by rivers, which led to that
hypothetical idea of [person]person_266|Buffon[/person] & of [person]person_125|[person]person_125|Hutton[/person][/person]
mentioned in a former lecture, [underline]"That a [/underline]
[underline]time will arrive, when the present land[/underline]
[underline]must disappear, from constant degradation[/underline]
[underline]by water, & be washed into the abyss[/underline]
[underline]of the Sea[/underline]

- It has usually happened that Men
possessed of that strong imagination which
is the principal Element of Genius, -
endeavour to make every series of facts
subservient to some grand law, or
[underline]universal principle.[/underline] & this practice
which often leads to sublime discoveries,
is sometimes the source of mistaken views
& erroneous interpretations of Nature. -
- And this |_ if we can reason with
propriety only from what is known;
from the present order of things), this
has happened in the construction of the
hypothesis that has just been mentioned. -
- For supposing the degradation
of [underline]Mountain peaks[/underline] - As [underline]these peaks[/underline]
from [underline]their low[/underline] temperature are the
sources of torrents - |_ with their constant

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00024|dnp04a524pp|88271127[/page]
diminution, there must be likewise a
correspondent diminution of the degrading
cause. - 
The [underline]beds[/underline] of torrents likewise in
cases when they are seated in the
hard rock, become defended from the
action of the atmosphere & from very
rapid changes of temperature, & from
the agency of ice; by the waters which
they contain - & in this case their decay
becomes almost imperceptible. -
- One of the most rapid torrents in
[place]place_159|Britain[/place] is that of the [place]place_409|Monach[/place]
in [place]place_1036|Cardiganshire[/place]. It rises under
[place]place_410|Plinlimmon[/place] - & by a continued series
of falls is poured into the [place]place_411|[underline]Rhediol[/underline][/place]
near [place]place_563|Hafod[/place] under a bridge called
[place]place_1019|the devils bridge[/place]. - At the bottom
of the fall is a considerable bason
into which the torrent pours from
a height of at least 70 feet. - I
visited this spot in 1802 & accurately
ascertained the depth of the bason. -
5 years after I repeated the trial
but I found no perceptible difference. -

The rock is a siliceous [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] which
contains no elements soluble in water. - The
mechanical force of the torrent acting
principally perpendicularly does not affect
its texture, & it is defended by the water
from the action of the air & from ice. -
- The small quantities of Materials,
carried into the sea by rivers are principally
brought down in floods, & are often partly
produced from peat and from decaying
vegetable matter & consequently in this case
were remotely derived from the Atmosphere. -
And great floods |_ supposing the [underline]degradation[/underline]
of the highest mountain peaks, to the level
of ordinary hills, must necessarily altogether
cease. -
- At one of the greatest waterfalls in
the [underline]World[/underline], that of [place]place_557|Tekendana[/place] in South
[place]place_878|America[/place]. - Where a river said to be twice
as large as the [place]place_825|Thames[/place] at [place]place_071|London[/place], pours
itself from the plain of [place]place_1020|Santa Fe[/place] into the
valley of [unclear]Madrilena[/unclear], by a continued
series of great falls, from an elevation of
at least a mile & half, the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
Rocks at the bottom are still [underline]pointed[/underline]
& unequal. -
- This wonderful phenomenon is very
little known. I shall read a short abstract
from the account of it by [person]person_465|M. Le Blond[/person]
"Nothing" he says, "can be more astonishing
than the scenery of the [place]place_1021|Bogota[/place]. -

Immense Rocks [underline]are seen below[/underline], rising
 amidst a sea of Clouds. - Above, are
the great [misc]misc_402|Cordilleras[/misc], forming as it
were a new & independent World
 beyond the Clouds - [place]place_1022|The river Bogota[/place]
after flowing quietly through the plain
moves more rapidly towards the valley, -
In its first fall it is stopped by an
immense block of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], & from this
rock it precipitates itself into an
unfathomable abyss & is obscured
in Clouds of vapours. -
It falls from a cool climate, &
is received in a warm one, by far
the greatest part of the waters are lost
by evaporation in its descent: but even
in the [place]place_1023|valley of the Madalena[/place] it is
still as large as [place]place_1024|the Seine[/place] at [underline]Paris[/underline]
after the Winter floods. -
- |_ The [underline]general[/underline] degradation of
Rocks and Mountains, can only be
conceived by a fancy that combines
the most remote circumstances.) &
in the present Order of Nature, an
Eternity seems almost insufficient for
the decay of the [place]place_247|Alps[/place] or the [misc]misc_402|Cordilleras[/misc] -
Mountains - having their bases of [deletion][chemical]chemical_125|Porphyry[/chemical][/deletion]

Wherever vegetables have fully
covered decomposing strata, they

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10405-000-00027|dnp04a527pp|88271130[/page]
defend the surface below them from a new
action of the Elements, & prevent to a
great extent any further decay, & by the
agency of their [underline]roots[/underline] they preserve the
light & finely divided Earth from being
carried away by rains, or scattered by
winds - Vegetables likewise
accumulate considerable proportions of their
inflammable matter from the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
in the Atmosphere & from water -
Trees decaying in their natural state, -
from the common directions of currents
of air or winds, against the ridge or in
[underline]front of[/underline] Hills and Mountains usually fall
with their branches towards the summit -
& the power of vegetation to collect &
elevate [underline]solid matter[/underline] is fully shewn
in the formation & increase of peat

- Amidst the changes produced
during the long succession of Ages, in

to be fully compensated for by the
effects of vegetation & of volcanic
fires; a subject which will be fully

Without referring to the labours of
Man, [underline]civilized[/underline] & [underline]reasoning[/underline], [underline]great[/underline]
effects, will be found to be produced
by many of the most inferior Classes
of living Creatures. -
Insect tribes in the bosom of the
ocean, insignificant in their individual
agencies, are enabled after a blind
but [underline]wise & wonderfully directed instinct[/underline],
to accumulate calcareous matter, &
raise it above the waves -
And many of the low & fertile Islands
under the Tropics are mere rocks
of [underline]Coral[/underline] covered by Soil - & in
the [place]place_1395|Pacific[/place] Ocean, such Islands
are abundant & are said to be
constantly increasing. -
- In the next Lecture I shall
enter further upon the detail
of the operations by which the
beautiful Cycle of terrestrial events
is preserved in an uniform order. -

It will be [deletion]further[/deletion] [insertion]then[/insertion] seen that whilst the
arrangements of Matter are continually modified
Its great forms are unalterable . -
in the grand Cycle of Events, nothing
can be said to be accidental, or without
design. -
The principles in the Earth, the
Sea & the Air are in continued

constantly made subservient to the
permanency of Life. -
 "By ceaseless [underline]motion[/underline], all that is Subsists:
Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel
That Nature rides upon - maintains
Her health, her beauty, her fertility
She dreads a moments pause - and
Lives but while she moves. -

All feel the freshening impulse - All are cleansed
By countless undulations." -
