- I shall ask your leave to wave all
discussions concerning the remote causes
of subterranean fire, till the [underline]general[/underline]
facts which constitute the [underline]present order[/underline]
of Nature have been fully stated.-
- I shall reserve all the problematical
& hypothetical views which appear worthy
of investigation [underline]for the conclusion[/underline] of
the course.- After [insertion]having fortified our judgements with[/insertion] the sober details
of the History of Nature [deletion]have been[/deletion]
[deletion]concluded[/deletion]; we may then venture [deletion]to amuse[/deletion]
[deletion]our selves[/deletion] without any danger of bewildering
our fancy, to amuse ourselves with
some few sketches of the romances of
Nature; but what is [underline]known[/underline]
& what is merely imagined should
always be preserved distinct, pure,
& unmixed [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]with[/insertion] each other.-
-. [deletion]Whatever may be[/deletion] [insertion]How ever obscure may be[/insertion] the origin of Volcanoes,

sufficiently [deletion]distinct[/deletion] obvious, [insertion]new effects[/insertion] as directed
towards the production [deletion]or[/deletion] & the
increase of solid land -
