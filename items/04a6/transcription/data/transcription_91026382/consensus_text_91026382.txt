the feldspar is at last converted
into a fine clay - the alkali
is washed out the earthy
parts remain -
Instance Porcelain clay
of Cornwall
The porcelain clay of Cornwall
is from a decomposing granite - &
the feldspar & Mica remain unaltered
& the clay is washed from them
- I have analysed a Specimen "
&c.-
"- The porcelain rock of Anglesea"
is a porphyry.- &c.
Instance
- |_ primitive Granites & porphyries have
not been chemical analysed - there
is here great room for discoveries
Most likely, they would be found to
contain little or no alkali
- No principle is more generally
diffused in our Rocks and Stones than
Oxide of Iron - It enters abundantly
into the composition of most of their
elements, [deletion]of Stones[/deletion], particularly Hornblende
