The [deletion]great[/deletion] [place_1022]river Bogota[/place_1022] after
flowing quietly through the plain
moves more rapidly towards the
Valley -. In its first fall
it is stopped by an immense
block of granite; & from
this Rock it precipitates itself
into an unfathomable abyss
& is [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] obscured in a cloud & vapour.-
It falls from a cool climate,
[deletion]into a warm one[/deletion]
& is received in a warm one.
by far the greatest part
of y[superscript]e[/superscript] waters are lost by evaporation in its
descent; but even in the
Valley of the Maddelenea
is it still as large as
the Seine[underline] at paris[/underline] after
the winter floods.-
