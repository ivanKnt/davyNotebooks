Lecture 5
[underline]Geology 1811[/underline]
In the preceding Lecture
the solid parts of the surface
of the globe have been considered
in what they may be regarded as
their states of permanency, in
their great & general arrangements.
[deletion]connected with the oeconomy[/deletion]
[deletion]of things[/deletion]
It has been seen that the
foundations of our Earth are
constituted by immense irregular
masses of consolidated materials
of a different kind; affording the
variety of mountain valley hill
& plain; forming the basins of
the ocean & of lakes & the
bed of rivers & intersected by

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10406-000-00002|dnp04a602pp|91026360[/page]
veins containing the metallic
ores & other substances which
have been made subservient
to the [deletion]wants[/deletion] [insertion]purposes[/insertion] & comports
of Man.
The [underline]natural order[/underline] of [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]investigation[/insertion]
leads to the examination of
the [underline]Laws[/underline] of the [underline]alterations[/underline]
of the surface of the Globe.
to an enquiry concerning the
powers by which the mechanism
of Nature is [deletion]made subservient[/deletion] [insertion]preserved[/insertion]
[deletion]to the purposes of life.[/deletion]
Change is the characteristic
of all terrestrial things; &
the most refined philosophy
of the subject, consists,
in tracing the order of events
by which[insertion] [underline]change[/underline] is made subservient to [/insertion]the [deletion]imprint[/deletion] [insertion]harmony[/insertion]
of our system [deletion]is preserved[/deletion]
& to the purposes of life.

[deletion]to the purposes of life.- [/deletion]
- In taking a view of the
[deletion]changes[/deletion] [insertion]alterations[/insertion] of the Globe connected
with Geology, it is necessary to
examine all the circumstances
that can operate; & all the
[deletion]change[/deletion] [insertion]agents[/insertion] concerned whether chemical
or mechanical.
- Our Globe by a beautiful
& wonderfully intelligent arrangement
is made to revolve round its
own axis & round the Sun,
in such a manner; that
its different parts are unequally
supplied with light & heat.;
That changes of temperature
are continually taking place
& all the variety of seasons
produced.

|_All water is ultimately
derived from the ocean which
occupies nearly 2/3 of the surface
of the Globe & which according
to the calculations of  [person]person_130|La Place[/person]
cannot possess a [unclear]mean[/unclear] depth
of less than four miles.-
Acted on by the attractions
of the Sun & Moon, this
great Body of [deletion]water[/deletion] [insertion]fluid[/insertion] is

- I shall ask your leave to wave all
discussions concerning the remote causes
of subterranean fire, till the [underline]general[/underline]
facts which constitute the [underline]present order[/underline]
of Nature have been fully stated.-
- I shall reserve all the problematical
& hypothetical views which appear worthy
of investigation [underline]for the conclusion[/underline] of
the course.- After [insertion]having fortified our judgements with[/insertion] the sober details
of the History of Nature [deletion]have been[/deletion]
[deletion]concluded[/deletion]; we may then venture [deletion]to amuse[/deletion]
[deletion]our selves[/deletion] without any danger of bewildering
our fancy, to amuse ourselves with
some few sketches of the romances of
Nature; but what is [underline]known[/underline]
& what is merely imagined should
always be preserved distinct, pure,
& unmixed [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]with[/insertion] each other.-

Here begins 2[superscript]d[/superscript] part
The alterations (which we have now
to consider) are of a very different
order; " & the [underline]principles[/underline] by
which they are produced, are
in a great measure exterior to
the rocks & mountains in
which they occur " - & exist
in the atmosphere or are derived
from the general laws of the
planetary system.- They operate
[underline]more slowly[/underline]; but their effects are
more certain & more uniform; &
all their results are more
immediately & more intimately
connected with the phaenomena
of living nature -
The parts of the surface
exposed to Heat to light & to
air, are in a continued state
of [underline]change[/underline];- |_ the causes of
their modifications are very
complicated; but the laws by
which they are governed; are
constant & unalterable; Here

[deletion][deletion]In[/deletion] - In "describing the various families[/deletion]
[deletion]of Rocks, I mentioned some of[/deletion]
[deletion]the facts relating to their[/deletion]
[deletion]changes of texture & different [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]forms[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]I stated generally that some were very easy of destruction[/deletion]

[deletion]that all yield more or less, rapidly & evidently or[/deletion]
[deletion]were brought forward - no alternate[/deletion]

[deletion]:- One of the most general of[/deletion]
[deletion]the causes of decomposition[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]decomposition[/deletion] alterations of Rocks "is which[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]change[/deletion][insertion]alterations[/insertion]of temperature to which[/deletion]
[deletion]they are exposed." exposed.[/deletion]
[deletion]In consequence of the annual &[/deletion]
[deletion]diurnal motions of the earth" the[/deletion]
[deletion]heat of the surface is in a[/deletion]
[deletion]constant state of change; & though[/deletion]
[deletion]in their most interior parts; rocks[/deletion]

[deletion]& maintains pressure & temperature which[/deletion]
[deletion]is about the mean of the temperature[/deletion]
[deletion]of the atmosphere, yet superficially"[/deletion]
[deletion]there is a continual variation. -[/deletion]
-" Their parts in generall are nonelastic"
but are expanded by Heat & contracted
by cold" - |_ & such agencies operating
in the long course of ages" there is
every reason to believe must at
last alter the texture of the
surface" & diminish the aggregation
of its parts" -
- Take for instance a [underline]mass[/underline] of [chemical]chemical_099|grauwacke[/chemical]
[deletion][unclear][chemical]chemical_075|Serpentine[/chemical][/unclear][/deletion] or [unclear]marls[/unclear] composed of parts unequally
expansible, suppose it cooled in a
March night to 32° the freezing
point - in the morning by the
sun beams " the degree may be raised
to 60 - on [deletion]it[/deletion] the surface - [insertion]while the interior remains unaffected[/insertion] this
would occasion a considerable expansion
which must tend " in the common
laws of mechanics to [unclear]separate[/unclear], or
at least to diminish cohesion between
the exterior [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] the interior parts.

"- This cause however [deletion]is rarely susceptible[/deletion] [insertion]can scarcely ever exert[/insertion]
[deletion]of an[/deletion] [insertion]an[/insertion] independent operation" - And it
is usually connected with "what"
may be called the expansive agency
of water" -
- All rocks in proportion as
their texture is more or less solid
are [deletion]more[/deletion] [insertion]less[/insertion] or [deletion]less[/deletion] [insertion]more[/insertion] permeable to
moisture - ; & even the hardest
& most chrystalised have pores susceptible
of receiving it" -
- This piece of [deletion]hard[/deletion] [insertion]compact[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] is apparently
dry, another piece of the same
kind & as free from moisture
is acted upon by Heat" - Vapour
[deletion]moisture[/deletion] is given out from it I perceive
it distinctly.-
Instance
& this moisture existed in its
pores & was derived from the atmosphere.
- The case would be similar
with any other rock but the quantity
would differ in different specimens

[page]14|MS-DAVY-10406-000-00014|dnp04a614pp|91026372[/page]
Soft [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] would produce
more than [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] - [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical]
more than [chemical]chemical_075|serpentine[/chemical] & the
secondary soft [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] more
than the primary hard [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
which" least of all exhibits
this property.
-: The Water found in cavities
in the interior of [underline]many[/underline] stones
particularly of [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]. -" seems _|
to be owing to their permeability
to the moisture of the atmosphere,
- I have seen in loose columnar
[chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] near " Portrush in the
[place]place_437|North of Ireland[/place]" which when
broken affords considerable portions
of water, which have all the characters
of rain water.- |_& that its
texture is permeable to vapour I
proved by a very simple exp[superscript]t[/superscript].-
A [deletion]piece of[/deletion] small column was broken
into two parts "one [insertion]immediately examined[/insertion] afforded cavities
[insertion]almost[/insertion] all of which were filled with water
the other was kept under a [deletion]grate[/deletion] [insertion]fireplace[/insertion]
for two or three days, where the

that of the boiling point of water"
there was no explosion or mechanical
disintegration of the stone" - but
when it was broken no water
was found it [deletion]had[/deletion] all [insertion]had[/insertion] escaped
through the pores," in consequence
of the evaporating agency of Heat.-
- [underline][unclear]Instance[/unclear][/underline]
- /_In the great series of Natural
operations, [underline]the moisture[/underline] included in
stones, or adhering to their surfaces
in a fluid form," has its volume
altered by every change of temperature;
in a much greater degree than
the strong matter.-
- The sudden impression of Heat
from the sun beams " causes it to
expand -" & this expansion must be
usually connected with a slight
alteration in the texture of the Rock"
- When "the water is converted
into ice" there is a still greater
enlargement of its volume"

[page]16|MS-DAVY-10406-000-00016|dnp04a616pp|91026374[/page]
the surface in this case when
fully permeated with fluid is
often separated into parts - & the
whole arrangement destroyed
- The destructive operation of ice
is particularly distinct upon those
rocks which present in their
character as masses small &
numerous apertures - in which the
sides are so approximated as
to admit of; the adhesion

the Blocks are [insertion]usually[/insertion] too large & the

The [underline]causes[/underline] of the decomposition
of Rocks are wonderfully complex

& the end obvious " - |_The finely

in which [insertion]even[/insertion] [underline]the trees[/underline] of the

& which is capable of
rewarding the labours of the

- The greater part of the surface

the bed of vegetation, soon

the fertility of soils is determined in a great
measure by climate by situation and their
relation to rivers and moisture - And
the most productive lands in different
parts of the Globe and in different
latitudes differ [underline]very much[/underline] in composition.
But in general it may be said
in considering their chemical nature " that
the soils of [deletion]volcanic countries are by far[/deletion] [insertion][chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] and calcerous[/insertion]
the most fertile - They contain usually
[chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] and calcarious [deletion]matter[/deletion] [insertion]earth[/insertion] their
texture is equable and of a proper
degree of permeability with regard to
water [deletion]|_ and carbonaceous matter a substance[/deletion]
[deletion]capable of becoming the food of plants[/deletion]

[deletion]- I " exhibited in a former lecture a Sketch[/deletion]

In the same district and in

One of the most rapid torrents
in [place]place_159|Britain[/place] that that of the [place]place_409|Monach[/place]

At the bottom of the fall
is a considerable basin

I visited this spot in 1802
