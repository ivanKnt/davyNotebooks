Most of the changes that now<lb/>
take place in the solid parts of the Earth<lb/>
except those produced by volcanic fires<lb/>
were discussed in the last lecture. I<lb/>
shall now ask permission to direct your<lb/>
attention to this part of the subject, which<lb/>
demands an extensive discussion.<lb/>
To persons who inhabit countries, happily<lb/>
not liable to these grand &amp; awful operations,<lb/>
they may appear rather as <hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

But their extent, their constancy, &amp; the<lb/>
ultimate tendency of their effects lead<lb/>
to a very different conclusion; &amp;<lb/>
inevitably prove to us, their importance<lb/>
their efficacy, &amp; even their utility in the<lb/>
great series of the phenomena of Nature<lb/>
Volcanic fires have operated to a<lb/>
great extent in all quarters of the Globe,<lb/>
&amp; they appear to have occurred in the<lb/>
earliest ages of which we have any<lb/>
authentic records. -<lb/>

The Mountain had been <add>remarkably</add> quiet for<lb/>
seven Months, nor did the usual<lb/>

at times it emitted Clouds, that<lb/>

a fountain of bright fire, attended with<lb/>
a very black smoke, &amp; a loud report<lb/>
was seen to issue, &amp; rise to a great<lb/>

Cone of Vesuvius. - And soon after<lb/>
another of the same kind broke out at<lb/>

impossible that any description can<lb/>

of the Ocean during a violent<lb/>

it is scarcely possible for us to<lb/>

at a distance; &amp; from their awful<lb/>
nature, it is scarcely possible for the<lb/>

precision. -<lb/>
- These circumstances have induced<lb/>
many Philosophers to give up the<lb/>
enquiry as hopeless; |_ but we<lb/>
are possessed by the <hi rend="underline">discoveries</hi> of<lb/>
Modern Chemistry of many analogies<lb/>
on the Subject. - &amp; as far as these<lb/>
can be our guides, it is certainly fair<lb/>
to pursue the <hi rend="underline">investigation</hi>. -<lb/>

the beginning of the last century<lb/>

of being applied, discovery should never<lb/>
be despaired of. - I do not mean<lb/>
to insinuate that we shall probably<lb/>
gain the same power of averting the<lb/>

we have done those of Thunder Clouds -.<lb/>

the active imagination<lb/>
One of the earliest Hypotheses<lb/>
formed to account for the origin of<lb/>
Volcanoes is, that a permanent<lb/>
central fire occupies the interior<lb/>
of the Earth; &amp; that the apertures<lb/>
of burning Mountains are the places<lb/>
by which it finds vent, by which<lb/>
it is sometimes discharged into the<lb/>
Atmosphere. -<lb/>
- This notion would be admirable<lb/>
from its simplicity, if it did not<lb/>
interfere with all our established ideas,<lb/>
&amp; all known facts concerning the nature<lb/>
&amp; communication of heat. -<lb/>
Heat in all its states is capable<lb/>
of being transferred from body to body<lb/>
&amp; if the interior of the Globe had<lb/>
been from all time in a state of<lb/>
ignition; the effects must have been<lb/>
long ago communicated to the surface<lb/>
which would have exhibited, not<lb/>
a few widely scattered volcanoes,<lb/>
but one glowing and burning mass.<lb/>
- The Philosophers who have defended<lb/>
this opinion have gone further even<lb/>

- We can reason only by induction<lb/>
or analogy from facts that we are<lb/>
acquainted with, &amp; all the common<lb/>
phenomena of fire occurring on the<lb/>
surface of the Globe are connected<lb/>
with Chemical changes, with the<lb/>
mutual agencies of different substances<lb/>

Volcanic Mountain after eruptions<lb/>

effects in the same district &amp; the<lb/>
different intensity of the effects at<lb/>
