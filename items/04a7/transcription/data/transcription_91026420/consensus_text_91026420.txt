The passage is one of the finest in
[underline]the Odes[/underline] - I shall read a few lines
of it in West's Translation
- "Now under Sulphurous Cumas sea seabound Coast
And vast Sicilia, lies his shaggy breast
By snowy Etna nurse of endless frost
The Eternal prop of heaven for ever fresh
Forth from whose nitrous caverns issuing, rise
Pure liquid fountains of tempestuous fire
And veil in ruddy mists the noon day skies
Whilst clothed in smoke the eddying flames aspire." -
- In South America, in the
[underline]Cordilleras[/underline] the highest [underline]Mountain Chain[/underline]
belonging to the Earth, a number of
Volcanoes now exist in a state of
activity. In Japan, in
Kamschatka & in Iceland, a
great part of the surface has been
formed or modified by the agency
of [underline]Volcanic Fires[/underline]. In Sicily, &
in a number of the Islands of the
Mediterranean Sea, their effects are
equally visible. -
- A terrible eruption of Etna
is recorded by Thucydides to have
taken place 476 years before Christ,
