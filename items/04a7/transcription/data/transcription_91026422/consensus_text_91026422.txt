- Till within the last few years,
[underline]Volcanoes[/underline] had been merely a matter
of wonder & vague narration - &
had little occupied the attention
of philosophical Persons. - Sir
William Hamilton may be said to have
been the first accurate observer
of the Phenomena. - His
magnificent work on the "Phlegraean
fields" is well known, it equally
demonstrates the extent of his knowledge
& the refinement of his Taste. - It
affords the true & picturesque
Character of a great Volcanic region
and the illustrations are the productions
of an elegant & acute mind. -
The path pointed out by our
celebrated Countryman was immediately
followed by [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]an able[/insertion] Philosopher, [deletion]of whom[/deletion]
[deletion]in a former lecture I made honorable[/deletion]
[deletion]mention[/deletion]; by Dolomieu. - In
his work "Sur les isles Ponces" the
most minute observations may be
found combined with the most
enlarged views. & the Author
has enlightened his Geological researches
by the assistance of the most refined
methods of Chemistry known in his
time. -
