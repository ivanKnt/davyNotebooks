exterior bases of Volcanic Mountains, &
which have not been altered by fire,
differ very much in species in different
Countries & their nature is in no
way connected with the changes taking
place in the interior, & lower regions
of the district. -
( - The seat of volcanic fires is deep
in the bosom of the Earth - & they have
often broken out amidst primary as
well as Secondary strata. -
- ( The Rocks that appear at the foot
of [underline]Vesuvius[/underline] are principally [underline]shell limestone[/underline].
The foundations of Etna are said to be
Granite & Porphyry - & these substances
according to the reports of Humboldt
constitute the base of the great Volcanic
Chain of the Andes, [underline]some of the eminencies[/underline]
of which are elevated to the [underline]enormous[/underline]
[underline]height[/underline] of four miles above the [underline]level[/underline]
[underline]of the Sea[/underline].
- The lower region of the Volcanic
Mountains, even when the substratum
of the soil is Lava, are usually
exceedingly fertile & when a long
continued quiet has prevailed in the
[underline]interior[/underline], vegetation is vigorous,
upon all parts of the surface, that
are not raised above the line of
perpetual snow.
- Even in the dreary Climate of
Kamschatka, the lowlands, in the
Summer Months are clothed with [underline]grass[/underline]
