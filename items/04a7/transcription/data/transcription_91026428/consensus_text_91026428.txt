of the Crater is about 3000 feet.
At the bottom is a considerable plain,
from which vapours of different degrees
 of density almost constently issue, &
the sides of it offer the remains of the

- D[superscript]r[/superscript] Van Troil mentions very similar
facts with regard to the different Craters
Of Heckla in Iceland, which having their
exterior covered with snow, constantly
emit from their interior vapours
insupportably hot, & exhibit walls
of Lava having the appearance of
black Glass. -
But of all the volcanic craters
that have been accurately examined,
that of [underline]Etna[/underline] is upon the grandest
& most magnificent scale. The
exterior walls according to Ferrara
are at least 1800 feet high & the
circumference of their edges cannot be
less than a mile & half. They are
composed of rugged pieces of Lava, &
approach to each other internally -
The bottom is a horizontal plane
from which constantly issue immense
columns of smoke. -
