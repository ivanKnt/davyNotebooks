in earlier times, & of the eruptions of
other volcanoes, - Whether the fire
breaks forth amidst the snows of
Iceland or the fertile hills of Italy,
it is announced by the same indications,
accompanied by the same effects, &
has the same termination. -
- In cases where phenomena are so
similar, the same reasonings may
be applied to their causes; (And
the immediate agents in Volcanic
Eruptions are in all cases evident. -
- The trembling of the Earth, the
noise in the Crater, & the loud
explosions are all evidently owing,
to the [underline]energy of elastic vapours,[/underline]
& it is by these, that the stones & ashes
are raised, the ground opened, &
the torrent of Lava poured forth. -
This explanation is so evident that
it did not escape the genius of the
Ancients. - Lucretius has given it in
his 6[superscript]th[/superscript] Book, in some lines that may
be thus translated
"In Etna's Caves expanded by her fires
With mighty force the imprisoned air aspires,
And whilst escaping from the vast profound
Shakes the firm earth, & scatters rocks around
O'er the green fields, & fertile vineyards pours
Ashes & sand - in desolating showers."
