The elastic matter given off in
volcanic eruptions is principally
steam mixed with inflammable
air with carbonic acid & some
other acid vapours. Sulphur likewise
is raised in the volatile state, for
it condenses sometimes on the
sides of the Crater; & the torrents
of rain which follow eruptions
& which are often more destructive
to the labours of the husbandman
& more extensive in their desolating
effects than fire, are owing to
the condensation of aqueous vapour. -
Sometimes Primary or Secondary
Rocks are thrown out by the force
of explosions unaltered by fire;
but the great products are matters
in igneous fusion, principally
consisting of the earths in intimate
combination with oxides of iron & alkali;
& mixed with more or less of the
unaltered materials of the Mountain. -

(It is from the products of the agencies
of volcanic fires alone, that we can
reason concerning their causes. - And
a number of difficulties undoubtedly
oppose themselves to the investigation. -
