the active imagination
One of the earliest Hypotheses
formed to account for the origin of
Volcanoes is, that a permanent
central fire occupies the interior
of the Earth; & that the apertures
of burning Mountains are the places
by which it finds vent, by which
it is sometimes discharged into the
Atmosphere. -
- This notion would be admirable
from its simplicity, if it did not
interfere with all our established ideas,
& all known facts concerning the nature
& communication of heat. -
Heat in all its states is capable
of being transferred from body to body
& if the interior of the Globe had
been from all time in a state of
ignition; the effects must have been
long ago communicated to the surface
which would have exhibited, not
a few widely scattered volcanoes,
but one glowing and burning mass.
- The Philosophers who have defended
this opinion have gone further even
than the [insertion]ancient[/insertion] Priests of Vesta, who though
they attributed a divine nature to
fire; yet knew that without fuel
the flame on their altars would
be soon extinct. -
