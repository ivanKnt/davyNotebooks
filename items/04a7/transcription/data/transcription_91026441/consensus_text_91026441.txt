- We can reason only by induction
or analogy from facts that we are
acquainted with, & all the common
phenomena of fire occurring on the
surface of the Globe are connected
with Chemical changes, with the
mutual agencies of different substances
on each other; & by the quiet of a
Volcanic Mountain after eruptions
the cessation & renovation of the
effects in the same district & the
different intensity of the effects at
different times, all point out to
Chemical Changes as the probable
cause for these grand occurrences.
- But what Chemical agents
are capable of producing such
effects? -
- If an operation of Combustion
has taken place, & I wish to
ascertain the causes, I examine
the results, & form my conclusions
entirely upon their peculiar nature
- Here is a vivid Combustion: -
suppose a white powder is produced
- I examine it, & find it
phosphoric acid. - Of course
I conclude that the effect
depended upon Phosphorus
