What the results of a Volcanic
Eruption? Lava. principally the
Earths & alkalies in a state of
ignition aqueous vapour, inflammable
gas which burns as it rises. -
But from what can these products
have arisen? - I have
mentioned the experiments which
shew that the Earths & alkalies
are capable of being reduced into
Metals which are amongst the most
combustible bodies in nature, so
that they even burn in contact
with water. -
- And if it be supposed
that the interior of the Earth contains
Alloys of these Metals with common
metals a supposition which is
warranted by the observation of
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Maskelyne & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish
on the mean density of the Earth;
the phenomena of Volcanic fires
might be easily explained
(Water it seems is always
connected with the effect. -
Most of the great Volcanoes
are near the Sea or extensive
Lakes, & aqueous vapour as
I have said is one of the
products, & inflammable air
which would result from the
decomposition of water by the
Metals - The elastic substances
