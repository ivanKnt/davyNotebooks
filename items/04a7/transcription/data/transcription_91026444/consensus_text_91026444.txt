(On the idea of the subterranean
fire being produced by the action of
water & air upon the Metals of the
Earths as I hinted in the Introductory
Lecture, / a general hypothesis of Geology
[underline]may[/underline] be founded. -
- Water & Air in certain operations
decompose & degrade Rocks. - but in
these operations, they may be considered
as acting a contrary part, as
consolidating & elevating them. -
- Electricity has been the great agent
for producing metals from Earths &
alkalies, & if it can be supposed
that Electricity acting under the
pressure of the Ocean, or in the great
subterraneous Laboratory of the Mineral
Kingdom is capable of separating
the inflammable bases of the Earths
from their oxygene - then these
might be assumed a perfect equilibrium
a consistent [underline]balance of powers[/underline]
in the [underline]system of[/underline] terrestrial Changes;
& a completion of that Order to which
so many other [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]causes[/insertion] as was
stated in the last lecture contribute. -
- The analogy of Nature likewise
is in favour of such a supposition
[underline]Vegetables[/underline], absorb principles from the
Atmosphere which are again evolved
into it, at the time of their decay. -
