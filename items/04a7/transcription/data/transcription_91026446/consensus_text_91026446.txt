Sir James Hall by a series of
beautiful experiments has shewn that
Basalt & even Limestone after being fused
will assume the crystalline form by
slow congelation [insertion]but in the [underline]specimens[/underline] of reproduced crystalline basalt that I have seen the crystals were only of one species whereas in the original, they were of two distinct kinds.[/insertion] but (Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] similar
to those of Sir J. Hall were made by
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Gregory Watt. he fused some hundreds
weight of Basalt, & by suffering it to
cool in a mass, examined the results
by breaking it into pieces. The
largest crystals were found in the interior
where the congelation must have been
comparatively slow. - His paper on
this subject is published in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of
London; & abounds in acute observations
& sagacious inferences . -
It was the first & only Geological
production of a Mind full of talent
& enthusiasm for Scientific pursuits. -
Of a Mind which promised much for
the Philosophy of this Subject; but
death cut off this bloom of promise
& hope for the Scientific World at
the moment it was brightest. -
No person attached to truth can
read his paper without a feeling
of regret, & I hope I may be
excused for the strong expression
of this regret, for whilst I admired him
as a Philosopher, I loved him as a
Man. He was the earliest & one of the
dearest of my Scientific Friends. -
