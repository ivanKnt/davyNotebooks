[underline]Lecture 1[/underline] Dublin Nov[superscript]r[/superscript] 5. [underline]1811[/underline]
-. I feel, [underline]very considerable[/underline] pleasure
in [underline]being again[/underline] permitted to
address an audience in this
Laboratory, on the subject
of Electrochemical Philosophy. -
[deletion]-. If there existed no [underline]other[/underline] motives;[/deletion]
[deletion]for calling forth my best [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]efforts[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]on this occasion - The [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] kindness[/deletion]
[deletion]the indulgence; with which my[/deletion]
[deletion]feeble labors were received[/deletion]
[deletion]last year would be more than[/deletion]
[deletion]sufficient to command all my[/deletion]
[deletion]best exertions on the present[/deletion]
[deletion]occasion[/deletion]. - [deletion]but[/deletion] I venture
to hope "[underline]that this[/underline] course of
lectures may tend, to the extension
& [underline]advancement[/underline] of an important
branch of [underline]Science[/underline]. |_If however there
[deletion]a[/deletion] existed no other motives |_the

[page]2|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00002|dnp04b102pp|77333702[/page]
kindness the indulgence with my
feeble efforts were received last
year would be more than
sufficient to call for my best
exertions. -
-[underline]In[/underline] expressing [underline]the grateful[/underline]
pleasure that I experience on
this occasion. |_I can not however
avoid saying [insertion]likewise[/insertion] that it is mingled
with [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]a degree of[/insertion] anxiety; the novelty
of the subject [insertion]to a certain extent[/insertion] will [deletion]in some[/deletion]
[deletion]measure of[/deletion] have passed away.
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] experimental elucidations
of Science cannot be infinitely
varied & its principles are
always the same. - & here
may be a diminution of 
the interest of the subject
to those who attended in
this laboratory last year,
from the similarity or
even identity of some of

[page]3|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00003|dnp04b103pp|77333709[/page]
the details. - [deletion]Yet[/deletion] [insertion]I venture to however to[/insertion] [deletion]I[/deletion] hope this will
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] in [deletion]some[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] measure be
compensated for by the general
improvement of the arrangement
 of the Science - -  I trust I
shall be able to prove to
you that some progress
has been made in discovery
even within the last twelve months,
& that the [deletion]properties[/deletion] [insertion]elements[/insertion] of
this branch of knowledge;
have attained a state in
which they are much more
worthy the attention of
accurate & judicious thinkers;
[insertion]more simple &[/insertion] more intelligible to students;
& more [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] capable of
being applied to the
profit or amusement of
general enquirers. -
[deletion]-[/deletion]
-: The objects of [deletion]chemical[/deletion] Electrochemical
Philosophy are all the known
substances belonging to our globe.

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00004|dnp04b104pp|77333716[/page]
The Ends of this Branch
of Knowledge are the
applications of natural substances
to [underline]new uses[/underline]; for increasing
the comforts & enjoyments
of them "& [insertion]for[/insertion] the demonstration
of the order, harmony &
intelligent design of the
system of the earth. -
[deletion]II[/deletion] - slow
- The foundations of
Electrochemical Philosophy
like those of every other
department of Natural
Science are observation
experiment & analogy. -
By Observation, facts are
distinctly & minutely
impressed in the mind.
-. By analogy, similar facts

are connected - By experiment
new facts are discovered. And
in the progression of Knowledge,
Observation guided by analogy, leads to
experiment; & [underline]analogy[/underline] confirmed
by [underline]experiment[/underline], becomes scientific
truth.
- To the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion][unclear][deletion]xxxxxxxxx[/deletion][/unclear][/insertion] philosophical
mind these ideas are familiar
but to the student or
illustrator may not be without
advantage. -
Whoever considers with attention
the slender green vegetable filaments
([misc]misc_270|Conferva rivularis[/misc]) which in the
summer exist in almost all streams
lakes & pools, under the different
circumstances of shade & sunshine
will discover globules of air upon
the filaments exposed under water
to the sun, but no air on
the filaments that are shaded - He will
find that the effect is owing to the

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00006|dnp04b106pp|77333730[/page]
presence of light- This is an
observation but it gives
no information respecting
the nature of the air.
Let the [misc]misc_271|confervae[/misc] be included
in a glass globe- filled
with water. & let the
app[superscript]s[/superscript] be exposed to the
sunbeams, the air
will collect in the
upper part. - - And
[deletion]if[/deletion] when the neck of
the globe is filled with
water; the air may
be passed into the neck.
An inflamed taper
introduced will burn
with more brilliancy than
in the atmosphere -
as in this instance -
- This is an expt-
- If the phaenomena are

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00007|dnp04b107pp|77333738[/page]
reasoned upon & the question is
put whether all vegetables of
this kind in fresh or salt
water do not produce
such air under like circumstances
the enquirer is guided by
analogy - & when this
is determined to be the
case by new trials a
general scientific truth is
established - that all [misc]misc_271|confervae[/misc]
in the sunshine produce
a species of air that
supports flame in a superior
degree which has been
shewn to be the case by
various minute investigations -
- & [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the general[/insertion] scientific truth
admits of numerous applications
to the oeconomy of nature, such as
the deterioration & renovation
of the atmosphere & the uses of
even the humblest forms of vegetable

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00008|dnp04b108pp|77333741[/page]
In the general system of things. -

-- These principles of research &
combinations of methods have
been little understood except
in late times : [deletion]but[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] in
[deletion]consequence of their application;[/deletion]
[deletion]without allmost all the great[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] & almost the whole
of the great future of
modern science has been
raised [deletion]in consequence of[/deletion]
[deletion]their application[/deletion] upon them.-
- A few important discoveries
indeed have been owing
to [underline]accident[/underline]; but their application
& connections [insertion]have entirely depended[/insertion] upon experimental
researches, guided by just analogy.
- It is by experiment [deletion]the only[/deletion]
[deletion]guide to truth[/deletion] that the
different species of matter have
been made to act upon each

other, their relations determined
& their hidden properties discovered;
[deletion]& experiment may not be unaptly[/deletion]
[deletion]compared to the chain in a mythological[/deletion]
[deletion]fable which binds down the[/deletion]
[deletion][misc]misc_057|Proteus[/misc] of Nature, which oblige[/deletion]
[deletion]him to declare himself[/deletion]
[deletion]& to display his real form.-[/deletion]
But [deletion]chemistry[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]the sciences[/deletion] facts[/insertion] have arisen from
the workshops of the artisan
or from the furnaces of the
alchemists [insertion]to become parts of[/insertion] an extensive &
profound science, that they have
[deletion]become[/deletion] [insertion]gained their[/insertion] [underline]connection[/underline] with electricity;
[deletion]that [unclear]xx & xx xx[/unclear][/deletion] offered new
views of the operations
of Nature & exalted the
resources of art And experiment
may not unaptly be compared
to the chain / in my mythological
Romance which binds down the
[misc]misc_057|Proteus[/misc] of Nature & [deletion]exhibits[/deletion]
[deletion]him[/deletion] obliges him [insertion]to confess[/insertion] what He is,

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10421-000-00010|dnp04b110pp|77333747[/page]
to renounce his monstrous & mishapen forms,
& to exhibit himself in his orderly,
comely, & divine [deletion]form[/deletion]. [insertion]lineaments[/insertion]. -
I cannot perhaps better
introduce to you the
elements of electrochemical
Philosophy; than by giving
a general view of the
objects of these lectures.
& offering some preliminary
illustrations respecting them.
- In such a view; I shall
be able to point out the
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] peculiar arrangements
that will be adopted; & the
circumstances which have led
to their adoption.
