 condition: - A freedom of
motion in the parts of
Bodies, or a want of

as an [deletion]chemical[/deletion] axiom "That
Bodies cannot act chemically
on each other unless one
of them be fluid or aeriform
& this proposition is still
retained in many elementary
treatises
There are however
a number of instances
contradictory to it
