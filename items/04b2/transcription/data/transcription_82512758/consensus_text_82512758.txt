or by great force of contact.-
- In almost all the chemical
arts [underline]solution[/underline] is an
essential circumstance; &
in the phaenomena of
external Nature, the
commencement of chemical
operations may in almost all
cases be traced to the agencies
of fluids, or aÃ«riform
substances.- (Thus in the
Bosom of our Rocks & Mountains
where air & water is
in capable of penetrating, all
is permanent & still, without
change or motion. Wherever
Water is capable of acting
decomposition slowly goes on,
& this agent gradually degrads,
or undermines the strata exposed
to its operation.)
