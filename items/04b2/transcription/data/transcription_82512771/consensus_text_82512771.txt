[deletion]still more decisive[/deletion]
- If two perfectly neutral
salts are mixed together
which naturally decompose
each other; The mixture
remains perfectly neutral; there
is no excess of acid or
of alkaline matter.- Consequently
[deletion]the same[/deletion] [insertion]one[/insertion] quantity of [deletion]one[/deletion][insertion]one[/insertion] alkali
or earth will uniformly separate
the same [insertion]relative[/insertion] quantity of another
whatever be the acid in which
it is dissolved - . & one acid
in like manner will separate
one proportion of another so
that all neutral salts
must contain definite
proportions.-
