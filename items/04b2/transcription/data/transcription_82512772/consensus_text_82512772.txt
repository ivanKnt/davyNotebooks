On M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollets views
it would be scarcely
possible to command uniform
proportions in any compounds.-
 - Salts chrystalizing in alkaline
solutions ought uniformly
be alkaline salts; the proportions
varying according to the
quantity of alkali in
the solution. & in like
manner any excess of
acid ought to be
capable of combination
with an alkali which
is known not to be
the case.
- It would not be a
difficult task to combat.
