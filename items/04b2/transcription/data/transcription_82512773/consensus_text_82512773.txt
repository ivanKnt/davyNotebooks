many other of the views
develloped in "the new
researches on the Laws
of Affinity.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollet in the
commencement of his enquiries
justly considers cohesion
as the same power as
chemical attraction; yet
in the course of his work
 He continually opposes it
to affinity as a counteracting
cause.-
- He regards those Bodies as
having the most powerful
attractions for acids which
saturate the largest quantities:-
supposing Magnesia & alumine [deletion][insertion]& [chemical_035]Soda[/chemical_035][/insertion][/deletion] possessed
of higher affinities than Potash
which instantly disengages them
from their combinations.
In short if M Berthollets
views were to be adopted there
