as surface not as mass.
Instance
If we suppose two
elements combining according
to the laws -
they would retain their
[underline]peculiarity[/underline].
& if solids by
attracting other solids
might give rise to
regular chrystals.-
- Magnetism offers
a parallel case.
Instance
- [underline]Tourmaline[/underline] Boracite
electrical in the
 axis of the chrystal.
