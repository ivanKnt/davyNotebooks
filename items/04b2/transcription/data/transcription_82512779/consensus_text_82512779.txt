- If proportions are definite
& powers of attraction; these
forms must be determined
by them; & the ingenious
modern system of chrystallography
will at once elucidate
& be enlightened by Chemistry.

great humility; - there
may be generalizations of
a still higher kind unknown.-
- yet when on awakening
from sleep we see a gleam
of light on the horizon, it
is not easy to avoid
the conclusion that it is
the harbinger of day.
