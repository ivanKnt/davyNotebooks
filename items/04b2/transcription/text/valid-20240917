In considering the active powers
which produce the phaenomenon
of Nature, it is not necessary
to enter upon any abstract
disquisitions upon the essence
of matter, or upon the
manner in which our sensations
are affected by the parts
of the external universe.-
We constantly [deletion]perceive[/deletion] [insertion]witness[/insertion]
a series of motions & changes
in the system of the earth
& an order & an arrangement
resulting from them which [deletion]requires[/deletion]
[deletion]as soon as it is understood[/deletion]

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00004|dnp04b202pp|82512742[/page]
[deletion]excites our warm admiration[/deletion]
to be admired requires only
to be perceived (the object
of Science is to ascertain
the Laws which govern these
motions & changes & [deletion]which[/deletion] the
powers which produce this
beautiful arrangement.-
The phaenomenon which
is most constantly before
our eyes is the Attraction
of Matter.
- A stone thrown into the
atmosphere rapidly descends
to the earth.

condensed into drops in the
upper regions of the atmosphere
falls [underline]in rain[/underline].-
These effects are in [underline]consequence[/underline]
of the [underline]attraction of[/underline] the
[underline]earth[/underline]. or Gravitation.-
- It is the power which
acts upon masses. The
planets are retained in their
orbits by it. - The earth
if not in rapid motion
would be determined to
the Sun by its operation.-
- Gravity acts at a distance
& its influence combined with
that of the primary
motions of the celestial
bodies is the cause of the

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00006|dnp04b204pp|82512744[/page]
conservation of the grand
system of the universe.
- When two polished
plates of [deletion]glass[/deletion] [insertion]marble[/insertion] are closely
pressed together a considerable
effort is required to
separate them & the
phaenomenon is independent
[deletion]upon their attraction[/deletion] of the pressure of
the air or any external
force. - It results
from that attraction
which is called cohesion
& which is exercised at
no [underline]sensible distance[/underline]; &
which depends upon the

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00007|dnp04b205pp|82512745[/page]
surface & not on the
mass. for if several pounds
of [deletion]glass[/deletion] [insertion]Marble[/insertion] were to be added
to each of these plates.
the cohesion of the surfaces
would neither diminish or
increase -
The [underline]same power[/underline] gives
the globular form to small
portions of mercury.
- And under the name
of the attraction of
aggregation is the cause
of the permanent regular
forms of solid bodies

[page]8|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00008|dnp04b206pp|82512746[/page]
& almost solid bodies in fact
may be resolved into a few
[underline]regular forms;[/underline] attached to each
other by like sides; & on
these forms of aggregation
or of Attraction the
theory of chrystalization depends
to which I shall often have
occasion to refer &
which is a striking
instance of the sagacity
of its founders, Bergman,
Rom√© d lisle & above all [underline]Hauy[/underline].
- This cohesive attraction,
This attraction of Aggregation
cannot with propriety
be distinguished from Chemical
Attraction - It preserves

bodies as aggregates; - & it
produces their composition.-
- they act alike at insensible
distances.- Gravity is considered
as the [underline]same[/underline] force whether
it preserves the coherence
of a mountain & keeps it
fixed to the earth, or
causes a heavy body to
descend.- & The attractive
force which acts at insensible
[underline]distances must[/underline] be considered
as the same, whether it
produces new aggregates
or preserves them.
I mentioned in the
introductory lecture, that
the most important of the

[page]10|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00010|dnp04b208pp|82512748[/page]
chemical phaenomena of
nature & of Art depend
upon chemical attraction
or [underline]chemical affinity[/underline] -
(It will be necessary therefore
to consider with some
attention, its [underline]general[/underline]
[underline]laws[/underline], & to witness
their efficacy, & to illustrate
their operation [underline]by experiments[/underline]
(I fear that in this
part of the course I shall
often have occasion to
exercise your patience. The
most important experiments
on attraction are not
those most calculated to

[page]11|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00011|dnp04b209pp|82512749[/page]
impress the eye;- And the
propositions except when
examined in their relations
to the facts appear as
a collection of obscure &
abstract terms.- (These
propositions form however the
basis of the Science & before
it is possible to build
[underline]either a lasting[/underline] or an
[underline]elegant edifice[/underline]; good &
sound foundations must be laid
& they cannot be ornamental
use must be looked for
in them & not beauty.-
[deletion]In explaining the phaenomena[/deletion]
[deletion]of Attraction I shall sometimes[/deletion]
[deletion]have occasion to refer to[/deletion]
[deletion]numbers; but I shall not[/deletion]
[deletion]attempt to enter into any[/deletion]
[deletion]arithmetical calculations. I hope[/deletion]

[page]12|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00012|dnp04b210pp|82512750[/page]
[deletion]to be able to exhibit the[/deletion]
[deletion]a series of numbers to[/deletion]
[deletion]which I referred in my[/deletion]
[deletion]last lecture in a manner[/deletion]
[deletion]in which they will require[/deletion]
[deletion]little attention to be understood[/deletion]
[deletion]& which I trust will render[/deletion]
[deletion]the science much more[/deletion]
[deletion]simple & much more[/deletion]

- [underline]The first general expression[/underline]
of facts with respect to
chemical attraction is
that when bodies combine
chemically they always undergo
a change in their form or
volumes, or a general
alteration in their properties
- (Every part of the operative
Science will furnish illustrations
of this principle - It is in

- The more slowly the

soil or absorbed from the
air are newly arranged
in the plant, take an
infinite variety of forms;
are employed for food
or modified or changed
in various ways for the
purposes of y[superscript]e[/superscript] arts.-
 - As Chemical attraction
was defined in the last
lecture to be a power acting
only at insensible distances,
it is obvious that those
substances which exert it must
be brought in apparent
contact. - This is an essential

[page]18|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00018|dnp04b216pp|82512756[/page]
 condition: - A freedom of
motion in the parts of
Bodies, or a want of
cohesion, marvellously assists
combination [insertion][unclear]Eg; lavender[/unclear][/insertion] but does not
appear to be essential
to it,- fluids & gasses act
more readily than solids
for their parts possess
more mobility
- It was formerly considered
as an [deletion]chemical[/deletion] axiom "That
Bodies cannot act chemically
on each other unless one
of them be fluid or aeriform
& this proposition is still
retained in many elementary
treatises
There are however
a number of instances
contradictory to it

[page]19|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00019|dnp04b217pp|82512757[/page]
 - Dry Muriate of Lime & powdered
ice [underline]or snow[/underline] liquify by being
rubbed together
An amalgam of lead
& an amalgam of Bismuth
are in the same case
instance.
And if Phosphorus
& oxy[superscript]e[/superscript] of Potash be
gently rubbed together
an explosion with light
& heat loudly appeals
against the truth of
the principle.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- In general however solid
Bodies can be made to
act on each other
only with great difficulty

[page]20|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00020|dnp04b218pp|82512758[/page]
or by great force of contact.-
- In almost all the chemical
arts [underline]solution[/underline] is an
essential circumstance; &
in the phaenomena of
external Nature, the
commencement of chemical
operations may in almost all
cases be traced to the agencies
of fluids, or a√´riform
substances.- (Thus in the
Bosom of our Rocks & Mountains
where air & water is
in capable of penetrating, all
is permanent & still, without
change or motion. Wherever
Water is capable of acting
decomposition slowly goes on,
& this agent gradually degrads,
or undermines the strata exposed
to its operation.)

The History of Nature
likewise [deletion]is an[/deletion] [insertion]offers [underline]innumerable[/underline][/insertion] instances
of [deletion]compound[/deletion] such compositions;-
- (Most of our rocks
& Stones, & metallic
ores, contain more
than two or three constituents

[page]23|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00023|dnp04b221pp|82512761[/page]
& in the vegetable & animal
kingdoms the variety is
almost infinite; & compounds
possessing different forms consistence
colours & properties, arise
from the different combinations
in different proportions of
three or four substances
supposed to be elementary.
- The next law of affinity
to which I shall ask
permission to direct your
attention is the most
important of all & yet
it is capable of a very [insertion]short &[/insertion] simple
expression.-
- It is that different
bodies combine according
to different degrees of force

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00024|dnp04b222pp|82512762[/page]
& with a selection according
to that force.-

} Sulphuric acid
- Potash

up first -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] may be easily
made; but the results would
be imperceptible without
near inspection - I dare
say you will take the
fact for granted & the
fact is proved by a phaenomenon
which may be easily exhibited
& easily seen for a solution
of [deletion]Lime[/deletion] Magnesia is readily precipitated
by a solution of Potash
in water.

- Instances -
Instances might be multiplied to any
extent.- And most of
the operations of chemistry
depend upon this law.-
- Solids are thrown down
from fluids or gasses -
- & gasses disengaged from
solids or fluids.-
- Instance
fluoboric gas
water in air
- Carbonic acid in chalk

- Phaenomena of this kind
led the same great Genius
who first discovered the

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00026|dnp04b224pp|82512764[/page]
laws of the planetary system
to adopt the expression
of chemical attraction
& to point it out as
a force belonging in
different degrees to the
different species of matter.-
- And the election or choice
of one body by another
to the exclusion of a
third led Geoffry of
the Academy of Sciences of
paris, to adopt the
term [underline]elective[/underline] affinity
which has been since generally
used, though I confess
the term elective attraction
appears a more unexceptionable

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00027|dnp04b225pp|82512765[/page]
& significant word & one
equally intelligible & equally
simple.-
- Bodies unite with different
degrees of force & hence one
body is capable of
separating another from its
combinations; & in consequence
of the same circumstance
mutual decompositions of
different compounds take place,
- This has been called double
affinity or complex chemical
attraction.

there are few cases
[deletion]of[/deletion] in the decompositions
of the neutral salts in
which [deletion]they do not occur[/deletion]
in which if the influence
of water be not excluded;
there is not an
operation of this kind.-
Thus when Lime is thrown
down from a solution by

Potash the Lime is in
combination with water;
& this attraction must
assist its precipitation;
& in the s[deletion]t[/deletion]lacking of Lime
it may be seen with
what avidity it absorbs
& consolidates water. -
- Geoffry constructed tables
of affinities in which He
endeavoured to arrange Bodies
according to their relative
attractive powers for others,
& Bergman enlightened by
the examination of a
number of ye processes,
of double decomposition,
improved & extended these
arrangements, which for a

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00030|dnp04b228pp|82512768[/page]
while were referred to by
Chemists as certain guides
to the [underline]more refined[/underline] parts
of the science.
- (In 1798 M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollet
at that time accompanying
the french expedition in Egypt
read a [insertion]series[/insertion] paper to the Institut
of Cairo in which He
endeavored to overturn
all the established ideas
upon chemical affinity
& to shew that it was
a power extremely variable
influenced by a number
of circumstances; but more
particularly by the quantities
of the acting bodies.-
- If says this enquirer
two Bodies in different quantities

[page]31|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00031|dnp04b229pp|82512769[/page]
& having different affinities

will be divided between them
in proportion to their quantities
& their relative attractive
powers.-
I mentioned in the last
lecture that it was my
intention to combat, these
opinions of this celebrated

[deletion]still more decisive[/deletion]
- If two perfectly neutral
salts are mixed together
which naturally decompose

remains perfectly neutral; there
is no excess of acid or
of alkaline matter.- Consequently
[deletion]the same[/deletion] [insertion]one[/insertion] quantity of [deletion]one[/deletion][insertion]one[/insertion] alkali

french school.- [deletion]& render[/deletion]

On M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollets views
it would be scarcely
possible to command uniform
proportions in any compounds.-
 - Salts chrystalizing in alkaline
solutions ought uniformly
be alkaline salts; the proportions
varying according to the
quantity of alkali in
the solution. & in like
manner any excess of
acid ought to be
capable of combination
with an alkali which
is known not to be
the case.
- It would not be a
difficult task to combat.

many other of the views
develloped in "the new
researches on the Laws
of Affinity.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollet in the
commencement of his enquiries
justly considers cohesion
as the same power as
chemical attraction; yet
in the course of his work
 He continually opposes it
to affinity as a counteracting
cause.-
- He regards those Bodies as
having the most powerful
attractions for acids which
saturate the largest quantities:-
supposing Magnesia & alumine [deletion][insertion]& [chemical]chemical_035|Soda[/chemical][/insertion][/deletion] possessed
of higher affinities than Potash
which instantly disengages them
from their combinations.
In short if M Berthollets
views were to be adopted there

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10422-000-00036|dnp04b234pp|82512774[/page]
could be no certainty in Chemical
Science; no confidence in
the results of analysis;-
Combinations would be infinitely
complicated, (& no uniformity
could be expected in the
productions of Nature, or in
the results of Art.
- In adopting the idea of
definite proportions &
definite attractive powers
the phaenomena are such
as might be [deletion]expected[/deletion]
conceived to result; from

- If proportions are definite

forms must be determined
by them; & the ingenious

great humility; - there
may be generalizations of
a still higher kind unknown.-
