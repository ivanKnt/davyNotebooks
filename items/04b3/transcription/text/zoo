- I have ventured in the papers
which I have published on
this subject to adopt the
name of the earth with
a termination in um
as the nomenclature
for those new metals
taking the derivation
from the latin - Thus
Strontium Barium Calcium
alumium Silicium signify
the metals from Strontites
Barytes, Lime, alumine & silex. -
- These names may be considered
as independent of any
hypothetical views;" or of
any properties which 
on investigation [insertion]may not[/insertion] be found
characteristic; & these

[page]6||dnp04b306pp|72106203[/page]
were my reasons for adopting
them; names are less likely
to be changed, in proportion
[underline]as they are[/underline] simple [unclear]and[/unclear]
[underline]unequivocal - & taken in[/underline]
[underline]their original application[/underline]

These facts of the
Metallization of the earths
may serve to explain
[deletion]some[/deletion] various [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion]phaenomena[/insertion] in
metallurgy.

[deletion]I have already spoken of the[/deletion]
[deletion]possible use of some of the[/deletion]
[deletion]new alloys[/deletion] -
Besides applications to the
arts these facts may have
some applications to phaenomena
in Nature. In the infancy
of the investigation I can
merely throw out a few
hints; which very possibly
hereafter upon into
theoretical views.-

the metals of the earths cannot exist
at the surface of the globe but [insertion]they may[/insertion] prob-
-ably form part of the interior( and
such an assumption would offer a
theory for the origin of Volcanoes and
earthquakes the formation of Lavas, &
would probably lead to a general
Hypothesis in Geology. -
It appears from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Mr
Cavendish and the observations of
D[supercript]r[/superscript] Maskelyne that the specific
Gravity of the whole earth is at
least twice as great as that of
the known surface.-
This alone might lead one to

[page]10||dnp04b309pp|72106209[/page]
Suspect that it contained metallic
matter; The specific gravity is above
that of the earths and below that
of the common [underline]metals[/underline]; about the
mean which would be produced
by alloys of the metals of the earths. -
[The eruptions of volcanoes are proved
by numerous facts to be connected
with the flowing in of water thro'
Some subterranian cavities, - And
the results of Volcanic fires, the new
products, are the earths in a state
of fusion ( and all the effects are
such as may be easily conceived,
if we suppose them to be the conse-

[page]11||dnp04b310pp|72106212[/page]
-quence of the action of moisture & air
[underline]upon metallic bodies, bodies[/underline], capable of being conc-
-erted into earths by oxydation.-
Upon no other principle, [insertion]is it[/insertion] can we accou-
-nt for the cessation and renovation
of Volcanic fires; for the enormous quan-
-tity of stony matter that they pour
forth; or for the [underline]intense inflamma[/underline]
- [underline]tion[/underline] where there is no [underline]indication[/underline]
of the presence of common combustible
materials, or of the usual results of
combustion.-
There is in this mass of dry clay a
[insertion]a little potassium[/insertion] and
Strontium.-
As long as it is dry it undergoes

[page]12||dnp04b311pp|72106214[/page]
no change, but let it be acted upon
by moisture.-
The clay is rent in pieces and actual
combustion occurs.-
This minute effect can give only
a feeble idea of what [underline]might[/underline] be pro-
-duced by operations on a great
scale in Nature.- In which the
waters of the sea or of lakes acted
upon immense masses of the metals
of the earths. - (In such cases the effects
of the explosion might be well concei-
ved to be felt throughout a whole
continent - and the Lava poured
fourth might cover miles of country.-
Islands might be raised, and Hills
and mountains elevated.-

[The influence of air and water upon
our existing land is continually tend-
-ing to degrade and decompose it
and our rivers are constantly car-
-rying the divided matter of soils into
the sea.-
For this principle of [underline]decay[/underline] there
must be in nature some correspond-
-ing principle of renovation.- (And
if we suppose the interior of the globe
to be chiefly constituted by
the metals of the earths; this principle
will be obvious.-
As the surface above is destroyed the
interior must become exposed and
from the action of water and air

[page]14||dnp04b313pp|72106218[/page]
new soils and new earthly substances
[underline]must result, in the place of those[/underline] which
had been degraded or carried off -/-
[and in the general oeconomy of
nature, electrical currents probably
the same as [underline]those exhibited[/underline] in the
[underline]Aurora Borealis & Australis[/underline], may
be the means of disuniting inflam-
-mable matters from oxygene, and
separating metals from their combin-
-ations, (so as to preserve a constant
[underline]and uniform relation[/underline], between the
solid, the fluid, and the aeriform
parts of the globe, | rendering them
fitted for the purposes of animated

[page]15||dnp04b314pp|72106221[/page]
being, and [underline]giving them[/underline], [underline]a harmony[/underline]
which must have arisen from [underline]design[/underline];
and which connected with [underline]life[/underline] and
with [underline]happiness[/underline], could, [deletion][unclear]must[/unclear][/deletion], flow [insertion]only[/insertion] from
infinite wisdom & [deletion]unbounded[/deletion] [deletion][insertion]enforcible[/insertion][/deletion] goodness. -
( Besides the Geological speculations to
which the new facts apply, they may
afford elucidations of some extraordi-
-nary phenomenon of Meteorology
Amongst the various mysterious cir-
-cumstances connected with the fall
of [underline]meteoric[/underline] stones, no one has more
perplexed Naturalists than their igni-
tion and their apparent combustion
in the atmosphere, and the vivid
light they emit.-

[page]16||dnp04b315pp|72106223[/page]
But these phenomena may be easily account-
-ed for on an Hypothesis which flows from
the ideas which have been just developed -
(The meteoric stones all of them consist
principally of the earths in a loose state
of aggregation, and if we suppose that
they come into our atmosphere in a
metallic [deletion]state[/deletion] [insertion]form[/insertion] - Their combustion would
be a necessary effect of their combination
with oxygene; and [deletion]their combustion[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion]
would become more vivid; in their
descent, in [underline]proportion[/underline] [underline]as they passed[/underline]
[underline]thro' a denser air[/underline].
[deletion]All the accounts of the great [unclear]meteors[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]which have been best observed are[/deletion]
[deletion]conformable to such a motion, and that[/deletion]
[deletion]which passed over part of N. America[/deletion]

Upon so new and extraordinary
a subject, it may not perhaps
be wholly uninteresting that I
should [insertion]detail [unclear]x[/unclear][/insertion] some historical
[insertion]views[/insertion]. - It is possible
that a part of my audience
may not be aquainted with
them, - [deletion]& I shall likewise[/deletion]
[deletion]devellope some of the[/deletion]
[deletion]hypothetical [insertion]general[/insertion] views concerning[/deletion]
[deletion]respecting these subjects[/deletion]
[deletion]the origin of meteors.[/deletion]
They will enlighten the
general discussion.-
