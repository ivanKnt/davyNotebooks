- On Augt. 18. 1783 a great
Meteor was seen to pass
over Britain connected with
the same phaenomena as
that of 1758 but smaller
in size - From the most
accurate data, it was evidently
[deletion]above[/deletion] [insertion]nearly[/insertion] 50 [underline]miles [deletion]in[/deletion] high[/underline], in
all parts of its course, observed
in [deletion]this island[/deletion] [insertion]England[/insertion] | & from the
comparison of the observations
made there, with those made
in the continent; it must
have described an arc in
the heavens not less than
[deletion]a[/deletion] 1000 miles in [deletion]ex[/deletion] extent.
- This is a sketch made
of the appearance of the
Meteor of which some accurate
engravings have been published, &
the [deletion]appearance[/deletion] [insertion]phaenomena[/insertion], & the effects
in the explosion were such
as could not well be attributed
to any other cause than that
