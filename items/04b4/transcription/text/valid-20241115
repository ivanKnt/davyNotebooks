Two very ancient Authors

- . . |_In modern times the first fact

is by an eye witness the
celebrated [underline]Gassendi[insertion]a[/insertion][/underline] a Man
equally free from vulgar
superstition & vulgar prejudice.
On the 27 of Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 1627. This
philosopher states "that the Sky
being quite clear He saw a
burning stone fall on the
Mountain Vaisir in Provence.-
It appeared [deletion]to[/deletion] about 4 feet

by a circle of light; &
produced a loud report
like that of Cannon -- |_ On
examining the spot where

mountain - The fact
was insulated & He
thought that its [deletion][unclear]x xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]falling Body[/insertion]
[insertion]was[/insertion] the product of the Eruption
of some of the Italian
Volcanoes. -
|_ - In 1672. a similar
narration was published
[deletion]of a the account[/deletion] of the
fall of [deletion]two stones[/deletion] two ignited
masses near Verona one
weighing 300 & the other
400 pounds & the phaenomenon
was authenticated by the
testimony of three or
four Hundred Persons
In 1756 . de la
Lande [deletion]published[/deletion] brought forwards

an analogous History of
a stone that fell in 1753
in the neighborhood of
Pont de Visle. that
weighed 20 lb & that
had buried itself in the
Earth to the depth of
more than half a foot. -
- In 1758. on Nov[superscript]r[/superscript] 26;
a great Meteor appeared in
England which was generally
described as of the size
of the full moon but much
brighter, which was accompanied
by a luminous train & burst
with a great explosion [deletion]&[/deletion]
producing a [deletion]long train of[/deletion] [insertion]most vivid light[/insertion]
[deletion]light[/deletion] "- No [deletion]heavy[/deletion] Stones
[deletion]Bodies[/deletion] were found after
this event; but several
Philosophers reasoning merely
from the phaenomenon of

[underline]its motion & [deletion]app[/deletion]form[/underline], concluded
that it must have been
[deletion]h[/deletion] a heavy Body which at
its first appearance was
more than 70. miles from
the Earth
- In the year 1768 no less
than three stones were presented
to the Academy of Sciences at
paris, all of which were
authentically stated to have
fallen in different parts
of France one in the Cotentine
another in Artois & a third
in the [unclear]Maine[/unclear]; they were
all similar in their external
& internal characters as far
as the examination was
carried -". And they were
described as having fallen
in the day time with
explosion

- On Augt. 18. 1783 a great
Meteor was seen to pass
over Britain connected with
the same phaenomena as
that of 1758 but smaller
in size - From the most
accurate data, it was evidently
[deletion]above[/deletion] [insertion]nearly[/insertion] 50 [underline]miles [deletion]in[/deletion] high[/underline], in
all parts of its course, observed
in [deletion]this island[/deletion] [insertion]England[/insertion] | & from the
comparison of the observations
made there, with those made
in the continent; it must
have described an arc in
the heavens not less than
[deletion]a[/deletion] 1000 miles in [deletion]ex[/deletion] extent.
- This is a sketch made
of the appearance of the
Meteor of which some accurate
engravings have been published, &
the [deletion]appearance[/deletion] [insertion]phaenomena[/insertion], & the effects
in the explosion were such
as could not well be attributed
to any other cause than that

to have been faintly
perceived at Rome; -.
-/_ The more ancient testimonies
of the fall of Stones [insertion]from [deletion]these[/deletion] Meteors[/insertion] might
be doubted.-" the recent ones
have been brought forward
with a degree of evidence
which it is impossible
for a candid mind to resist.
- On the 18[superscript]th[/superscript] of Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] 1795
the weather being cloudy, several
persons in the neighborhood
of Cap[superscript]n[/superscript] Tophams House in
Yorkshire heard a loud noise

sound & afterwards felt a
shock as if a heavy body
had [underline]fallen to the[/underline] ground
at a [underline]little distance from them[/underline]
|_ one of these a ploughman saw
a large stone falling towards
the Earth, eight or [underline]nine yards[/underline]
from the place where He stood,
It threw up the mold on every
side, & buried itself 21 inches
- This Man assisted by the others
who were near the spot
at the same time immediately
raised the Stone; & found
that it weighed [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] 56 lbs
- This stone [insertion]is the specimen[/insertion] [deletion]is now in possession[/deletion] of
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Sowerby of Lambeth " I have
examined it more than once" &
it differs from any of the common
productions of the Earth.- | externally
it is black as if it had been
rapidly passed through a strong
fire [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]so as to be[/insertion] partially vitrified. internally
it is loose in texture & composed

partly of earth & partly of ferruginous
Matter. -
|_ - On the 19 of Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] 1798
a great Meteor appeared
at Benares in India at
eight oClock; & at Krackhut
14 miles off the Inhabitants
saw the light heard a
loud explosion & immediately
after [deletion]heard[/deletion] a noise as
of stones falling" - The next
[deletion]Soil[/deletion] Morning the soil was
found in many places
torn up; & a number
of stones were taken out
of the apertures; & those
pieces that have been
sent to this country have
exactly the same character
as the stone that fell
in Yorkshire.

by a transmutation of [deletion]the[/deletion]
highly rarified aeriform matter

lithologie Atmospherique of
M. Izarn but [underline]in defending[/underline]
it the Author has proved
his ignorance " of refined Chemistry
& of the [underline]Laws of composition[/underline]
& attraction. . -
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Halley calculated that

notion which even the wildest

"That the Meteoric stones may

Whatever speculations we may

[deletion]be little doubt but[/deletion] [insertion]some reason to believe[/insertion] that [underline]falling[/underline]
[underline]stars[/underline], belong to the same
class of phaenomena -
- They cannot be electrical
[deletion]phaenomena[/deletion] [insertion]appearances[/insertion]; for Electricity moves
in no sensible time "&
the course of [deletion]the[/deletion] falling stars
may be [deletion][unclear]on[/unclear][/deletion] measured by moments -
- Nor can [deletion]be[/deletion] [deletion]they be[/deletion] [insertion]is it probable that they are[/insertion] owing to
inflammable airs kindled in
the higher regions; for such
a phenomenon would be
evident as a flash, [deletion]or[/deletion] a
corruscation or a Sheet of

- The direction of falling stars
is [deletion]almost[/deletion] uniformly [deletion]downwards[/deletion] [insertion]in curves[/insertion].
& this agrees with the opinion

[page]34|MS-DAVY-10424-000-00034|dnp04b434pp|82514201[/page]
That they are heavy Bodies. - And
assuming that they are [underline]masses[/underline]

but much [deletion]smaller, it is easy[/deletion] [insertion]higher their combustion[/insertion]
[insertion]could be [unclear]very feeble[/unclear][/insertion] [deletion]to conceive " that the materials[/deletion]

- "|_Several Masses of Iron,
have been found in different
parts of our Globe, inbedded

concerning the great mass of [insertion]native[/insertion] Iron found
in Siberia is that it fell
from heaven . - And in
the annals of the Indian
Emperor Jehangire written
by himself an incident of
this kind that happened in
1620 is distinctly recounted -
- The prince relates that a
Violent explosion was heard
at a Village in the Punjaub
& that during the noise a
luminous body fell from
above on the Earth. that
the Fiscal Officer of the district
immediately repaired to the
[deletion]district[/deletion] [underline]spot, where[/underline] the [underline]body was said[/underline] to
[underline]have fallen,[/underline] |_ & having found it to be [underline]still hot[/underline]
& not burnt up, caused it to be dug; when the
heat increasing, he at last came to a lump of iron
violently hot; that this was sent to court, where
the Emperor had it weighed in his presence, & ordered
it to be forged into a sabre, a knife, & a dagger;
that the workmen reported it was not malleable, but
shivered under the stroke; & that it required to be

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10424-000-00036|dnp04b436pp|82514203[/page]
mixed up with one third part of common iron
when the mass was found to make excellent
blades. The Royal historian adds, that upon
the incident of this [underline]iron of lightning[/underline] being
manufactured, a poet presented him with a
distich, purporting that, "during his reign,
the earth attained order & regularity; that
raw iron fell from lightning, & was, by his
world-subduing authority, converted into
a dagger, a knife, & two sabres." -
