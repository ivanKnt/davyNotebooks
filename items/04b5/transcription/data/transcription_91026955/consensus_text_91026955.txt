solitary study;- Apparently without
ambition:- he pursued Science
because his thirst for knowledge
was insatiable; because his
mind was entirely imbued

preserved in activity by the voice of fame; he made discoveries
of the highest magnitude & which will give immortality to his name.
I have been drawn into this
Eulogium; not merely because
it is fully deserved but because
the example of Scheele demonstrates
what great effects may be
produced by small means
how little is required to
extend the empire of knowledge
when Genius is assisted
by industry.
