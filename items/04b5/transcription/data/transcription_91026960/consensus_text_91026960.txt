is dissipated in burning;- the
[underline]acid remains[/underline]; & by heating
the acid with [underline]charcoal[/underline]
the charcoal disappears
& the phlogiston is restored
to the sulphur.-
- This is an excellent specimen
of the nature of the chemical
reasoning of the age-
Stahl neither proved that
the weight of the sulphur
was greater than that of
the acid, nor that the
weight of the charcoal was
added to that of the
acid; & yet, though Boyle
advanced [underline]an opinion[/underline] of
the same kind as that
of Hooke & defended it
