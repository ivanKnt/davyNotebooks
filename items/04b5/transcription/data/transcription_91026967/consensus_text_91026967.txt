Charcoal converts sulphuric
acid [underline]into sulphur[/underline] &
there is a loss of weight
The disciples of Hall
supposed [underline]charcoal[/underline] to
be pure Phlogiston; therefore
charcoal should have
no weight which is
known to be absurd.-
And M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish
ascertained that Charcoal
burnt in oxygene
produced carbonic acid
weighing exactly as much
as the charcoal &
oxygene consumed.
