it forms earths. - Oxygene
therefore or the producer of
acid is a very improper
name for it; - For there are
very powerful acids that do
not contain it; - And it
exists in the most energetic
alkalis; - It might be
called with more propriety
Hydrogene, the producer of
water, or [unclear]alkalige[/unclear]
or [unclear]geogen[/unclear]; but all these
names are equally exceptionable
at present it is better
to continue the name of
oxygene & to wait
for a more mature period
of the science for -
reform of the nomenclature.
