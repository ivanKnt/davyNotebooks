- I mentioned [insertion]in the introductory lecture[/insertion] that when
ever electrified surfaces
from the Voltaic apparatus
were made to act upon
Water; - Oxygene is [insertion]evolved[/insertion] produced
at the positive surface
& Hydrogene at the negative
& exactly in such quantities
as to produce water
by their combustion
[underline][deletion]- 2 of Hydrogene[/deletion] Instance[/underline]
- If we compare their relative
weights; - the weight of the
Hydrogene will be 1 that
of oxygene 7.5, & if those
weights be symbols of attractive
powers, then the + electricity
of that of 1 of Hydrogene will
ballance that of 7.5 of oxygene
