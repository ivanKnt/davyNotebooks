Science

extension & progression.-
- The whole series of discussions
that have been brought forward
upon the fire air, prove
that it is a body very
prone to enter into [underline]combination[/underline];
& with great energy & usually
producing light; & always heat.
- The compounds that it forms
differ according to the Nature
of the body with which it
combines;- Thus with [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
it forms a neutral compound
with [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical][deletion]ic acid[/deletion] a strong
acid.- With Potassium
a corroding alkali.
- with iron an insoluble
tasteless body & with certain metals

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10425-000-00036|dnp04b536pp|91026979[/page]
it forms earths. - [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
therefore or the producer of
acid is a very improper
name for it; - For there are
very powerful acids that do
not contain it; - And it
exists in the most energetic
alkalis; - It might be
called with more propriety
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical], the producer of
water, or [unclear]alkalige[/unclear]
or [unclear]geogen[/unclear]; but all these
names are equally exceptionable
at present it is better
to continue the name of
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & to wait
for a more mature period
of the science for -
reform of the nomenclature.

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10425-000-00037|dnp04b537pp|91026980[/page]
- I mentioned [insertion]in the introductory lecture[/insertion] that when
ever electrified surfaces
from the [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] apparatus
were made to act upon
Water; - [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] is [insertion]evolved[/insertion] produced
at the positive surface
& [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] at the negative
& exactly in such quantities
as to produce water
by their combustion

- If we compare their relative
weights; - the weight of the
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] will be 1 that
of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] 7.5, & if those
weights be symbols of attractive
powers, then the + electricity
of that of 1 of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] will
ballance that of 7.5 of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]

[deletion]- In the School of [person]person_182|Democritus[/person][/deletion]
It is a very important circumstance
& there will be many opportunities
for illustrating it; that
whenever [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] enters into
combination it [deletion]may[/deletion] is [deletion]be[/deletion] in
[deletion]always[/deletion] a proportion that
may be expressed by this
number [insertion]or[/insertion] of some multiple
of it that is either
7.5 15 22.5 30 & so

[deletion]by this weight; & a very[/deletion]
[deletion]ingenious Gentleman.[/deletion]
- I referred in the introductory
lecture to the Atomic hypothesis
which I am far from being
disposed to adopt. I am
much more inclined to believe
that definite proportions will
be found to depend; upon
the identity of the matters really
acting upon each other;
& that the true solution of
this most important part
of Philosophy will be found
in a great simplification
of elementary materials; but

[page]40|MS-DAVY-10425-000-00040|dnp04b540pp|91026983[/page]
the discussion of this [deletion]part[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] Doctrine properly belongs to
a more advanced part of
the course.- When it
