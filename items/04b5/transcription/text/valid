whilst yet unknown to the world neither excited nor

I have been drawn into this

an admirable hypothesis on

says He is nothing more than

This doctrine of Beccher

exp[superscript]t[/superscript].-
Sulphur in burning produces

How Stahl said Sulphur
consists of [underline]an acid united [/underline]
to Phlogiston; - the Phlogiston

[page]17|MS-DAVY-10425-000-00017|dnp04b517pp|91026960[/page]
is dissipated in burning;- the
[underline]acid remains[/underline]; & by heating
the acid with [underline]charcoal[/underline]
the charcoal disappears
& the phlogiston is restored
to the sulphur.-
- This is an excellent specimen
of the nature of the chemical
reasoning of the age-
Stahl neither proved that
the weight of the sulphur
was greater than that of
the acid, nor that the
weight of the charcoal was
added to that of the
acid; & yet, though Boyle
advanced [underline]an opinion[/underline] of
the same kind as that
of Hooke & defended it

[deletion]- When D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley discovered[/deletion]
[deletion]oxyg oxygene gas[/deletion] The influence

referred these phenomena
to the fixation of air

- It is a principle of

renders bodies lighter by
uniting to them.-
- But this vague

contradicted by some very

The disciples of Hall
supposed [underline]charcoal[/underline] to
be pure Phlogiston; therefore
charcoal should have
no weight which is
known to be absurd.-
And M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish
ascertained that Charcoal
burnt in oxygene

- The whole series of discussions
that have been brought forward
upon the fire air, prove
that it is a body very
prone to enter into [underline]combination[/underline];
& with great energy & usually
producing light; & always heat.
- The compounds that it forms
differ according to the Nature

combines;- Thus with Hydrogene
it forms a neutral compound

acid.- With Potassium
a corroding alkali.

it forms earths. - Oxygene
therefore or the producer of
acid is a very improper

very powerful acids that do

exists in the most energetic

called with more propriety
Hydrogene, the producer of
