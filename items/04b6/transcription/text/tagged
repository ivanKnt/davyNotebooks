myself experienced great

The History of the enquiries
made concerning the substance
which has been the subject
of this lecture shews the
danger of this mode of
proceeding.
- The confidence of the
French enquirers closed for nearly
a third of a century this noble
path of investigation, - which
I am convinced will lead
to many results of much
more importance than those which

[page]30|MS-DAVY-10426-000-00030|dnp04b630pp|88270821[/page]
I have endeavored to exhibit
to you. -
Nothing is so fatal to
the progress of the human
mind as to suppose that
our views of Science are ultimate
[deletion]complete[/deletion]; - That there
are no [deletion]enigmas[/deletion] [insertion]mysteries[/insertion] in Nature; -
[insertion]that our triumphs are complete & that there[/insertion]
[insertion]are no new worlds to conquer.[/insertion]
These who have fixed
the firm foundations of a
human knowledge, who
have most enlarged the

[page]31|MS-DAVY-10426-000-00031|dnp04b631pp|88270822[/page]

labored in the opposite toil

has been humility. -
