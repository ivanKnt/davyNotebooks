[deletion]I cannot perhaps explain to you the[/deletion]
[deletion]nature of the new arrangements in[/deletion]
[deletion]Chemical Philosophy which it is my[/deletion]
[deletion]intention to adopt in a more simple[/deletion]
[deletion]manner; than by entering into a[/deletion]
[deletion]detail of the different objects in this[/deletion]
[deletion]course of Lectures, & of the order in[/deletion]
[deletion]which they will be presented. -[/deletion]
If in this sketch I shall advance
opinions contradictory to those which are
[deletion]advanced[/deletion] [insertion]found[/insertion] in the most esteemed elemen
-tary books - I trust [deletion]from formed experience[/deletion]
[deletion]of your indulgence[/deletion] that you will not be
prejudiced against them because they
are novel or reject them because they
are extraordinary. -
If I should combat the doctrines of some
of the greatest masters of the Science -
It never will be in consequence of mere
speculative views, but from a conviction
