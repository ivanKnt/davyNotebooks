|_From the time of the early Greek
school, when water was considered as
the grand principle of all things,

have been sects of Philosophical
enquiries. -

agreed "[underline]to[/underline] consider [underline]as elements[/underline]
such substances only as they are
incapable of compounding or decompound
-ing; making the arrangement only
a temperary generalization - liable
to change with new aquisitions of facts
expressing only the existing state of
knowledge; and in no wise pretended
to be a standard of the resources of Nature
