|_Amongst the substances which are
undecomposable [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] there are remarkable
differences but such analogies as enable
us to divide them into two distinct
classes opposed to each other in their
powers of combination and in electrical
habitudes. -
The first class includes the [underline]bodies[/underline]
which may be called prime sup-
-porters of combustion - & they possess
that electrical relation corresponding
to the negative energy. -
The second class comprehends the
substances which are inflammable
and which possess the positive
electrical power with respect to
those of the other class -
