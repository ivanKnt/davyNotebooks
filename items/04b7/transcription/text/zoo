[deletion]Chemical Philosophy which it is my[/deletion]
[deletion]intention to adopt in a more simple[/deletion]
[deletion]manner; than by entering into a[/deletion]

[deletion]which they will be presented. -[/deletion]
If in this sketch I shall advance
opinions contradictory to those which are
[deletion]advanced[/deletion] [insertion]found[/insertion] in the most esteemed elemen
-tary books - I trust [deletion]from formed experience[/deletion]
[deletion]of your indulgence[/deletion] that you will not be
prejudiced against them because they
are novel or reject them because they
are extraordinary. -
If I should combat the doctrines of some
of the greatest masters of the Science -
It never will be in consequence of mere
speculative views, but from a conviction

[page]2||dnp04b702pp|82512782[/page]
of minute and repeated effort -
|_It is not necessary in doing justice to
the illustrious men who have laid the
foundations of chemistry to assert their
infallibility - No genius howeve sagacious
can anticipate all the instruments &
powers of Discovery; the progressive
nature of science in one of its noblest
characteristicks & the true Philosopher
will exult in the idea that the fabric
to which he had furnished materials
should be adorned & rendered more
perfect even by the hands of others.

matter by the agency of moisture & air,
in which [deletion]Chemistry[/deletion] [insertion]Nature[/insertion] as it were takes
to [deletion]itself[/deletion] [insertion]herself[/insertion] those elements which had been
for a while employed as the instruments
and agents of a Superior principle
for the uses and purposes of life. -
|_What it will be asked are the causes [deletion]&[/deletion]
of these and [underline]other like[/underline] effects? -
The prime causes Philosophers have [deletion]a[/deletion]
agreed to call chemical attraction
or chemical affinity. -
The power [insertion]by[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion] which different kinds
of matter, approach to and blend
with each other -
Thus it is said that there is a
chemical attraction between sugar
and water, between the air and
the inflammable matter of taper
in consequence of which they mix
intimately together, and produce

[page]6||dnp04b706pp|82512786[/page]
a new and more compounded form of
matter.
The nature of the operation of this power
of attraction and the laws by which it
acts will be the first objects for our
investigation in this course of Lectures. -
It will be shewn that it operates at
no sensible distance that it is a
power invariable in the same forms
of matter; uniformly producing the
same effects. -
I shall have to combat an idea which
has been generally received in these
countries adopted from the french
school of Chemistry namely that its
agency like that of gravitation is
influenced by the mass or quantity of
matter, and that however weak the
attraction of one species of matter for
another the power is capable of being

[page]7||dnp04b707pp|82512787[/page]
exalted by increase of its quantity so as to be
made equal to the power of different limited
quantity however strong. -
I once received this hypothesis because
I [underline]trusted fully[/underline] in the authority by which
the facts were brought forward. -
I am however convinced by experience of
their want of perfect exactness - The process
-es are of a very minute & difficult
nature, and the appearances I believe
have in some instances deceived and
in others are explicable by principles
more consonant to the other analogies
Science. -
If matter indeed acted chemically
by its mass, the agency of the ocean &
the atmosphere upon the earth would
 be irrisistible there would be no operating
upon limited quantities by exp[superscript]t[/superscript],
For the powers of the great arrangements
of the globe would be throught predominant
till an equilibrium was produced connected

[page]8||dnp04b708pp|82512788[/page]
with a quescence and an eternal sleep in
Nature -
In adopting the simpler view that I have
refer[insertion]r[/insertion]ed to; the laws of affinity are capable
of being estimated; and the forces expressed
and the powers that counteract them
and the changes that they produce
made subjects of distinct knowledge. -
|_In the pheaenomena of lightning &
the thunder storm; - we witness the
magnificent effects of Electricity, but
there are [deletion]an[/deletion] a [deletion]infinite[/deletion] variety of
results dependent upon [underline]the same[/underline] agent
less [underline]impressive[/underline]; but more obvious &
& constant in their occurence; and
no less important in the order of
Nature. -
Certain bodies when heated or rubbed
together attract light [insertion]substances[/insertion] such as ashes or
feathers or pith-balls - And light

different bodies [insertion]they[/insertion] become differently [deletion]electrified[/deletion]

attract each other; -
Quere [underline]glass[/underline] and [underline]silk[/underline]
In these [underline]minute and apparently triffling[/underline]
results, there is no [deletion]apparent[/deletion] [insertion]distinct[/insertion] relation to the
phenomena of chemical change, yet this
relation exists and may be developed
in a distinct and striking manner. -
Bodies that most powerfully attract
each other chemically are likewise
such ast act upon each other
electrically. -
Thus mercury and Zinc which
easily combine chemically when
heated together likewise act electri-
-cally - [underline][nonenglish_009]Quere[/nonenglish_009] tongue[/underline]
 Positive - & Negative -
And bodies that act electrically

[page]10||dnp04b710pp|82512790[/page]
are likewise capable of being made to
act chemically. -
An acid and an alkali which
are in different electrical relations of
positive and negative unite to form a
[underline]neutral salt[/underline].
And by the power of a highly
positive electrical surface the acid may
be attracted from the alkali
or by a negative surface the
alkali from the acid. -

These extraordinary phaenomena
of the connection of two powers so
remote in these obvious relations

|_From the time of the early Greek
school, when water was considered as
the grand principle of all things,
up to the present day, there have
been almost as many successions
of opinions on this subject as there
have been sects of Philosophical
enquiries. -
Modern chemists have however
agreed "[underline]to[/underline] consider [underline]as elements[/underline]

called oxymuriatic gas are the only known
undecompoundable bodies which can with
propriety be opposed to the inflammable

combustion to respiration to animal
life and [deletion]as[/deletion] is a principal motive

of science in France. That the bodies

were compounds of Hydrogene with

the continent except by the Philosophy
of Sweeden. - I stated likewise
that this opinion [deletion]When given up[/deletion] after being given

Oxygene or oxymuriatic gas will
separate at the positive surface; Acids
likewise will be determined to the

About 25 centuries ago in Greece
The Philosophical sect which has been
called the atomic, brought forwards

[page]28||dnp04b727pp|82512808[/page]
the Hypothesis that matter was not infinite
-ly divisible, but that it was constituted
by small particles or atoms indestructible
in their essence and which by their
arrangements and motions produced
all the phenomena of Terrestrial
changes. -
This opinion founded by Democritus
adopted by Epicurus & supported by
the tal[deletion]l[/deletion]ents and adorned by the
fancy of Lucretius; was applied to
chemistry by some of the mechanical
Philosophers who flourished in the
the beginning of the last century;
but in the progress of a science at
that time [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]scanty[/underline] in facts (so
[underline]universal a hypothesis was[/underline] but little
regarded; for as yet the foundation

of knowledge were to be laid in exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
|_The first modern chemist as far as my
information extends who endeavoured
to explain the enlightened doctrines

[deletion]Higgins[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]your[/deletion] the[/insertion] professor of Chemistry [deletion]Dublin[/deletion]
[insertion]in this Institution[/insertion]
who in a very ingenious work
published in 1789 [deletion](comparative view[/deletion]

[deletion][unclear]some[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] [deletion]plausible[/deletion] comparative view of the
Phlog- and antiphlogi [deletion]views[/deletion] [insertion]theories &[/insertion] of the
manner in which the union of
bodies may be explained by supposing
the compounds formed by different
particles of matter combining as
 1 & 1 or 1 & 2 or as 1 and 3. -
A similar view was developed
[deletion]last year in this Theatre[/deletion] [insertion]in 1805 [deletion]by M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion] Dalton[/insertion] by a very

[page]30||dnp04b729pp|82512810[/page]

ingenious enquirer [insertion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton[/insertion] who in a work since published
has endeavoured to connect all the phenomena
of chemistry with the peculiar notions of atomic
arrangements and has even undertaken
to measure & weigh the ultimate
particles of matter to ascertain their
distance from each other & to determine
the nature of the atmosphere of heat
by which they are surrounded. -
I shall sometimes have occasion to refer
to [underline]his[/underline] views but it will be generally
to oppose them - not because they are
dif[deletion]f[/deletion]icient in inginuity but because
I am convinced that they are contradicted
by refined observation and opposed by
the results of minute and accurate
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] -
Whether matter consist of indivisible
corpuscles or of physical points endowed

[page]31||dnp04b730pp|82512811[/page]
with active power[deletion]s[/deletion] or [deletion]of [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] possessing
attraction and repulsion are questions
which it is not perhaps within the
power of human sagacity to solve. -
But the forces by which the different
species of matter are acted upon, [deletion]&[/deletion]
the proportions in which they combine
are facts, independent of all conjectur[deletion]e[/deletion]al
[insertion]principles[/insertion] of the science. -
I shall present to you approximations
to the numbers which appear capable
of representing the proportions in
which the different agents of Chemistry
combine - And [unclear]these[/unclear]
numbers by a few simple combinations
may be made to typify the different
artificial arrangements of matter

[page]32||dnp04b731pp|82512812[/page]

estimated new ones may be learnt
from calculation. -
It seem probable from the [unclear]past[/unclear] progress
of discovery - That Chemistry at no very
distant [underline]period[/underline] will like [underline]astronomy[/underline]
become a science founded upon
mathematical principles - That the
number of elements will be diminish
-ed: & that arrangements of a very
simple nature will explain those
phenomena[deletion]s[/deletion] which are now referred
to complicated and diversified agents.
(I shall shew in the conclusion of the
course that if it be assumed the
two electrical powers or substances are

the same species of matter - the
