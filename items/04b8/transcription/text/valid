the [insertion]particular[/insertion] influence that science must

amelioration of [underline]a soil[/underline] is merely
the chemical change of some
of its materials - And in
the cultivation of a peat
moss, the most important principles
are chemical. The metallurgical
arts, soap making, bleaching
dyeing also depend for their
improvement upon scientific
principles, & the greater
progress that has been made
& perfection that has taken place
in particular manufactures, in
late times may also be traced
to the same source.

I shall mention one remarkable

any progress should be made
in science without being sooner
