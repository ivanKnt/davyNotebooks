The great capacity of such highly rarefied
matter is an obstacle to the indication
of temperature; but supposing [deletion]the[/deletion] a
communication of heat, the laws must
be analogous to those of heat communicated
to common air. If a long [underline]cylinder[/underline] of
metal, placed perpendicularly, be
heated in the middle, the warmest
part will be above, from the ascent
of heated particles of the elastic
medium; but if a [underline]sphere[/underline] be
heated in the middle, the hottest
portion will be below, as the heated
elastic matter must remain longer
in contact with the inferior than
with the superior portion. -
- I do not think we
have at present any
means of deciding upon this
