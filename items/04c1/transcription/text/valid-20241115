The great forms of matter in
the external world are constantly
impressing themselves upon [deletion]the[/deletion] our
senses, & a very superficial
observation only is necessary for
their [deletion]arrangement[/deletion][insertion]classification[/insertion]. -
[deletion][unclear]We xx[/unclear][/deletion] A solid body of
land which constitutes the
great part of the globe &
which is [deletion]com[/deletion]comparatively permanent

continued motion [deletion]& agitation[/deletion]
& an atmosphere constantly [deletion]agitated[/deletion]

or the clouds & vapours which
it supports;- give [deletion]rise[/deletion] sufficient
evidences of the existence
of three distinct states of
matter: - Besides these
there are phaenomena which
depend upon [deletion]the presence[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] the sun & the heavenly
bodies: - & The effects of
light & heat [deletion]are derived[/deletion] it
[deletion]either from matter that[/deletion] [insertion]is well known are connected[/insertion]
[deletion]they emit [unclear]a[/unclear] matter that[/deletion] [insertion]with their presence.[/insertion]

[deletion]This paper was covered [deletion]with[/deletion] yesterday[/deletion]
[deletion]with a substance named hornsilver[/deletion]
[deletion]- This white body. - half of it[/deletion]

- Solids fluids, elastic fluids or
gasses - & radiant or etherial
substances constitute the great
classes of natural [deletion]substances[/deletion] bodies
which by their operations or
changes produce the phaenomena
of Chemistry. -
- Of solids the varieties are
almost infinite - metals, inflammable
substances, stones, earths, gems
animal & vegetable productions; -
-.. forms the analogies of which
have constituted distinct sciences
the provinces of the natural
Historian the Botanists, the mineralogist
- are [underline]included in this comprehensive[/underline]
[underline]class of natural bodies[/underline]. -
-|_ Fluids are less numerous - but
water mercury oil, spirits
the pieces of plants & animals
present a sufficient diversity

- . Of gasses the varieties are
still fewer. They are not
contemplated in nature;
& most of them are productions
of modern Chemistry. - . They
are all transparent; but
they differ in density, some
in colour; & decidedly
in their properties. -

- These [deletion]forms[/deletion] [insertion]these classes of Bodies[/insertion] as I stated in the
introductory lecture are

produced on the eye - those
of Heat in organs of feeling;
by matter in motion | & it is

but whether there [underline]are many[/underline]
[underline]distinct species[/underline] or one
subtile fluid under different
modifications or whether
the particles of any kind
of matter in rapid
motion are capable of
producing the phaenomena
are [deletion][unclear]mak[/unclear][/deletion]subjects for
discussion. - & besides
- Heat & light radiant
matter produces other
effects [deletion]which may be[/deletion]
intimately connected with
the phaenomena of Chemistry
- This paper was covered
yesterday with a substance
named Hornsilver - Half of
it was exposed to day light
- the other half was preserved
in darkness - one is black
the other unaltered - At first
it must be supposed that the same
matter or impulse from

the sun which causes light produces
likewise this phaenomenon: . but
it is not so.- if / a beam
of the sun be admitted through
a hole in [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] dark
room - it will produce [deletion]se[/deletion]
a coloured image. . & a piece
of paper [deletion]in[/deletion] exposed to the beam
will be affected [deletion]by matter[/deletion]
where there is no visible
light. -
- There may be other influences
as yet undiscovered exerted by
[deletion]the[/deletion] rays from the celestial bodies
or from substances on the
surface of the earth -- a
few years only are passed
since we have become acquainted
with the varieties of gaseous
Bodies; |_ & still more refined
methods are required for
operating upon [underline]those subtile[/underline]

forms of [deletion]Matter[/deletion][insertion]bodies[/insertion]; the series
of events in the History

is necessary [insertion]as I mentioned in the introductory lecture[/insertion] to consider
the active powers belonging
[deletion]to bodies[/deletion] to Matter &
the laws of their operation.
-.By active powers are
understood those powers which
cannot be separated from the

|_ Active powers must be considered
as [underline]belonging to Matter[/underline]:- but
it is not necessary to [deletion]consider regard[/deletion] [insertion]suppose[/insertion]

may be regarded [underline]itself[/underline] as inert
& all effects produced upon it
as flowing from the same
original [deletion]source[/deletion][insertion]cause[/insertion] which as it
is intelligent must be divine.
- The same power of gravitation -
which [deletion]causes the planets to revolve[/deletion] [insertion]produces the revolutions of the planets[/insertion]

- The [underline]different powers[/underline] in nature
as harmoniously cooperating must
be referred to one source - . When
we perceive a great & magnificent
[deletion][unclear]builing[/unclear][/deletion] & magnificent [insertion]Building[/insertion] we know
that it must have been
the result of the labours
of various hands;- but we
are secure that the perfect
design by which its parts have
been arranged must have
been the [deletion]result of the[/deletion]

which I shall ask permission

constantly exerted & it is
equally important in the
oeconomy of Nature; [deletion]&[/deletion] in the
processes & arts of Social
life. & [deletion]as an instrument[/deletion]
[deletion]of [unclear]an[/unclear][/deletion] in the experimental
departments of Science.
-. -. The sensible; [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] phaenomena
of Heat require little illustration
- The effects of bodies [insertion]in this respect[/insertion] depend
not only upon the state of
Heat but upon the states of our
organs: [deletion]&[/deletion] if one hand has
been kept for some time in
cold & the other in hot
water; the same body that
feels hot to the one will
appear cold to the other.
- The sensations of heat like
those of vision are not perfectly

exposed to sunshine will not
perceive objects in a room where
the light would be dazzling
after [deletion]the day[/deletion] [deletion]being[/deletion] [insertion]it had been[/insertion] long
accustomed to darkness -
- The word Heat in philosophical
language is used to express
the [underline]cause[/underline] of the sensations
of heat & of the effects
connected with them & it
is the same as the "[underline]Caloric[/underline]
of the French nomenclature
[deletion]- I do not[/deletion] employed in most of the
elementary books on Chemistry.
- I do not adopt this word
because there appears to [deletion]me[/deletion] be
no necessity for it. -
Science can be nothing more
than the refinement of

common sense; - & its
language should be as nearly

- . One of the most [deletion][unclear]important[/unclear][/deletion] obvious
& important agencies of Heat is
the increase of volume which it
gives to bodies. -

[deletion]2[/deletion] It is evident that the density of
bodies must be diminished by
[deletion]the[/deletion] expansion [deletion]of their parts[/deletion] & in
the case of fluids & gasses the
parts of which are mobile, many
important phaenomena depend
upon this circumstance. - If
heat be applied to fluids or
to gasses, the heated parts
change their places & rise; [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] &
the colder parts descend & occupy
th[deletion][unclear]em[/unclear][/deletion]ose places.- . |_Currents are

- The [deletion]warm[/deletion][insertion]heated[/insertion] water rises to the surface

colder ones 'thus the warmth of the
gulf stream is felt [deletion]for an[/deletion] a
thousand miles from its source; &
deep currents pass from the colder
to the warmer parts of the sea; &
the general tendency of these changes
is to equalize the [deletion]temperature [insertion]heat[/insertion][/deletion] temperature
of the [deletion]globe[/deletion] - globe

- In the atmosphere, heated air is
constantly rising & colder air rushes
in to supply its place; & this event
is the principal cause of winds;
- the air that flows from the poles
[deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]towards[/insertion] the equator [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]in consequence [deletion]of[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]the rotati circumstances[/deletion]
of the rotation of the earth, has
less motion than the atmosphere into
which it passes, & occasions an
easterly current; the air [deletion]rising[/deletion] passing
from the equator towards the [deletion]pole[/deletion]
poles [deletion][unclear]in[/unclear] an opposite[/deletion] having more
motion occasions a westerly current;
& by thee variations of the heat
of the globe; the different parts of
the atmosphere, are mixed together,
cold is [underline]subdued[/underline] by heat -: moist air
from the sea is mixed with dry air
from the land & the great mass of
elastic fluid surrounding the globe preserved
in a state fitted for the purposes of
vegetable & animal life. -
{[deletion]When equal volumes of the same substance[/deletion]

law of the [underline]expansion[/underline] of bodies at

exceptions seem[deletion]s[/deletion] entirely to depend upon
some chemical change in the consti-

a similar number of [deletion]spheres[/deletion] cubes

-[deletion][superscript]5[/superscript][/deletion]- The expansion of water during its

these circumstances are of great
importance in the oeconomy of
Nature -: Water congeals only at
the surface where it is liable
to be acted upon by the sun
& by warm currents of air which
tend to [deletion]be[/deletion] [deletion]not[/deletion] restore it to the

liable to most of the affections which the
particles of common matter are assumed
to possess, to account for the phenomena;
such as losing its motion when combining
with bodies, producing motion when
transmitted from one body to another,
& gaining projectile motion, when
passing into free space: so that
many hypotheses must be adopted to
account for its mode of agency, which
renders this view of the subject
less simple than the other. Very
delicate experiments have been made
which shew that bodies when heated
do not increase in weight. This,
as far as it goes, is an evidence
against a specific subtile elastic
fluid producing the calorific expansion;

but it cannot be considered as decisive,
on account of the imperfection of our
instruments; a cubical inch of inflammable
air requires a good balance to ascertain
that it has any sensible weight,
& a substance bearing the same relation
to this, that this bears to platinum
could not perhaps be weighed by any
methods in our possession. -
Some arguments have been raised in
favour of the existence of a specific
fluid of heat, from the circumstances
of the communication of heat to bodies
in exhausted receivers, & from the
manner in which they are affected
by this heat; but there are no
means known to experimental science
of producing a perfect vacuum; even
the best Torricellian vacuum
must contain elastic matter.

The great capacity of such highly rarefied
matter is an obstacle to the indication
of temperature; but supposing [deletion]the[/deletion] a
communication of heat, the laws must
be analogous to those of heat communicated
to common air. If a long [underline]cylinder[/underline] of
metal, placed perpendicularly, be
heated in the middle, the warmest
part will be above, from the ascent
of heated particles of the elastic
medium; but if a [underline]sphere[/underline] be
heated in the middle, the hottest
portion will be below, as the heated
elastic matter must remain longer
in contact with the inferior than
with the superior portion. -
