Again, when Muriatic acid
gas is made to act
is made to act
upon oxide of [underline]Mercury[/underline]. -
- Mercury [insertion]The chlorine of the acid[/insertion]
[insertion]combines with the metal[/insertion]
oxygene & hydrogene
combine to [underline]form water[/underline].
 - It is in consequence of this
simple law that whenever
one body precipitates another
- from different [insertion]acid[/insertion] solutions
the same quantity of
one always precipitates
the same quantity of the
other. -
- And hence the different
chemical elements may be
expressed by numbers &
all their combinations
represented by [insertion]simple[/insertion] additions of
these numbers. -
