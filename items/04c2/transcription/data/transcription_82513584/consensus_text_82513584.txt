 - To find the number representing
an element it is necessary
only to find the smallest
proportion in which it
combines; - Thus one
volume of Hydrogene unites
to 1 of Chlorine & their
weights are as [deletion]3[/deletion] 1 to 33.5.
let Hydrogene be represented
by unity & Chlorine by
33.5 - (Then water
contains 2 of Hydrogene
in volume to 1 of [deletion]Hy[/deletion] oxy[superscript]e[/superscript]
& their relative weights are
1 to 15; suppose two proportions
of Hydrogene in Water; then
the number representing
oxygene will be [underline]15[/underline]. - &
15 of Oxygene with 2. 33.5
of Chlorine forms [underline]Euchlorine[/underline];
