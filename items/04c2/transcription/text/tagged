[underline]Chemical Attraction[/underline]
I have already spoken of [underline]chemical[/underline]
[underline]attraction[/underline] as the power opposed
to expansion or the [underline]agencies[/underline] of
Heat. - I have stated that
the most important phaenomena
of chemical change depend
upon the operation of these
two forces.: the one tending
to unite the other to
separate the particles of
Matter.
- It will be necessary to
enter into a discussion of
[deletion]upon[/deletion] - the Laws of Chemical
Attraction & to illustrate them

[page]4|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00004|dnp04c202pp|82513360[/page]
by experiments. - On this
occasion should I be
minute & tedious & dwell
too long upon familiar
instances I must beg you
 to pardon me. - (The
subject forms as it were
the scaffolding by which
the edifice of Chemical
Philosophy is to be erected;
- And it is necessary that
it should be constructed
with care; - that its
parts should be firm &
well connected. - In
some cases it is not
possible to adorn the
truths of the Science; &

[page]5|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00005|dnp04c203pp|82513372[/page]
[deletion]there are some [insertion]important[/insertion] propositions which[/deletion]
[deletion]will not [insertion]connect [unclear]also[/unclear][/insertion] admit either of novel[/deletion]
[deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] or[/deletion]
they must be studied for their
own sake; - (Whenever it is
in my power to bring forward
novel experiments - or
general philosophical views
or illustrations connected
with the order of nature
or the processes of the
Arts. - I shall not fail
to make the attempt;
& if I should be unsuccessful
in awaking interest or giving
amusement in the development
of the didactic principles of
the Science, I must pray
you to have the indulgence
to attribute it

[page]6|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00006|dnp04c204pp|82513382[/page]
not to my [deletion]want of[/deletion][insertion]deficiency in[/insertion]
zeal or of desire; not
 to an [deletion]deficiency[/deletion] of indisposi-
tion to exertion; but to
a want of ability.
Chemical Attraction is
the power by which the
parts of different bodies
unite: & stand with
each other & form a
new & a different substance
- Some Bodies are possessed
of no Chemical Attraction
for each other - Others
exert it with different
 degrees of force. -

[page]7|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00007|dnp04c205pp|82513398[/page]
- I shewed in the introductory
lecture that the Alkali called
[underline][chemical]chemical_035|Soda[/chemical][/underline] united with great violence
[insertion]of action[/insertion] to [chemical]chemical_087|oil of Vitriol[/chemical]; & that
[chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical] has a stronger Attraction
for aquafortis or [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical]
than [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] has so that
it is thrown down from its
solution by it.
-: The Law of [underline]combination[/underline] or
the union by chemical
 Attraction applies to all
the different ponderable
forms of Matter. - fluids
not only produce solid
matter; but [insertion]in some cases[/insertion] likewise gaseous
matter; & Gasses are condensed
into [underline]fluids or[/underline] solids; -

- Illustrations of chemical attraction
may be found in a variety
of the common processes &
arts of life . -
- The saccharine or [insertion][misc]misc_192|mucilaginous[/misc][/insertion] [deletion]astringent[/deletion]
matters in the vegetables & the
gelatinous [deletion]fluids[/deletion] substances from
animals are dissolved for
the purposes of food; - &
even culinary processes are
within the dominion of
Chemistry . - In the Art
of tanning; the organized substance
of skin is slowly combined
with astringent [deletion]& extractive[/deletion] [insertion]matters[/insertion]
[deletion]substances[/deletion]; which have been
extracted from the bark
of the oak by [deletion]boil[/deletion] Water:

& comparatively indestructible
- In dyeing colours are
immediately fixed upon 1 cloth
as when [misc]misc_810|silk[/misc] is plunged
into solution of indigo; &
in this case the colouring
matter has a stronger attraction
for the [deletion]clo[/deletion] stuff than for
its solvent; or made
to unite as in the case
of the reds of [misc]misc_506|Madder[/misc] by
the intervention of some
other body, such as

[page]13|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00013|dnp04c211pp|82513451[/page]
salts having a basis of clay;
& by the triple combination colours
are not only made brighter
but likewise less liable to
change. -
- In bleaching colouring matters

[deletion]the action[/deletion] of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion][chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical][/insertion] air & washed
out by water. -
- In the [underline]soap[/underline] manufactury
[misc]misc_372|tallow[/misc] & fossile alkali are
combined; & a substance of
great importance in civilized
life is the result of the
mere chemical attractive
forces between two bodies
- In the manufacture of true

formed in a similar
manner by a mixture
of alkali [deletion]&[/deletion] sand &

powers it is essential to their
[deletion]life[/deletion]. existence
- I mentioned in the introductory
lecture that [underline]bodies[/underline] which
attract each [underline]other chemically[/underline]
[underline]unite[/underline] in [underline]definite proportions[/underline].
This Law [deletion]is[/deletion] perhaps the
most important belonging to
our [underline]Science[/underline]; [deletion]It will[/deletion]
[deletion]therefore be proper & it[/deletion]
admits of elucidation
by a number of experiments.

Thus in whatever manufactory
[chemical]chemical_492|[underline]alum[/underline][/chemical] is made - it contains
identical quantities of alkali

are eight sided figures.
- [chemical]chemical_015|common salt[/chemical] whether formed

[underline]the alphabet[/underline] by which [deletion]the chemical[/deletion] [insertion]her chemical[/insertion]
[underline]language[/underline] [insertion][deletion]of Nature[/deletion][/insertion] [insertion][deletion]of the terrestrial system[/deletion][/insertion] is to be decyphyred.
& it is not composed of

of a few simple characters;
[deletion]& the language of Nature[/deletion]
[deletion]is as it were the an[/deletion]
[deletion]archetype, of[/deletion] [insertion]coincident with[/insertion] the best
[deletion]language[/deletion] [insertion]combinations[/insertion] of human reason
When two bodies combine
the relations "of their quantities
are always definite" but
the sometimes combine in
more than one proportion
& it is a very important
law of combination; that

[page]21|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00021|dnp04c219pp|82513535[/page]
the second proportion is always
a [underline]multiple[/underline]; or a divisor
of the first. -
- There is a substance called
[chemical]chemical_374|[underline]fluorboric acid[/underline][/chemical] - - combines
with two portions of [chemical]chemical_003|[underline]Ammonia[/underline][/chemical]
- one in volume - [underline]& 2[/underline]
in [underline]volume[/underline].
So that the first salt
[underline]contains half as much[/underline] alkali

other instances

[page]22|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00022|dnp04c220pp|82513544[/page]
- Iron burns in [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]

found in a certain proportion
[insertion]then[/insertion] when[deletion]ever[/deletion] it enters into
combination with another
body it is either in
the same proportion, or
a multiple; such as twice

& 2 of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] in volume
combine with one of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_022|[insertion]oxygen[/insertion][/chemical]
 - & - [underline]one of[/underline] [chemical]chemical_303|[deletion]Chlorine[/deletion][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
combines with [deletion]a half[/deletion] two
[chemical]chemical_022|[deletion]a volume of oxygene.[/deletion][/chemical]
of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical].
[underline]Instance[/underline]
It is in consequence
of these circumstances that

[page]24|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00024|dnp04c222pp|82513567[/page]
whenever compounds decompose
each other [deletion]in consequence[/deletion] [insertion]by[/insertion]
of double attraction or
double affinity: there
is always [underline]merely[/underline] a
new arrangement of their
[underline]elements[/underline] & none of
the substances are found
in excess or deficiency.
- Thus when the salt
called [chemical]chemical_375|Nitrate of Barytes[/chemical]
is mixed with the salt
called [chemical]chemical_077|Sulphate of Potash[/chemical];
- The [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] unites to the
[chemical]chemical_143|Nitr[deletion]ous[/deletion]ic acid[/chemical]: the
[chemical]chemical_042|barytes[/chemical] to the Sulphuric
acid & the mixture
is as neutral as
before.

[page]25|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00025|dnp04c223pp|82513577[/page]
Again, when [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical]
gas is made to act
is made to act
upon oxide of [chemical]chemical_012|[underline]Mercury[/underline][/chemical]. -
- [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] [insertion]The [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] of the acid[/insertion]
[insertion]combines with the metal[/insertion]
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
combine to [underline]form water[/underline].
 - It is in consequence of this
simple law that whenever
one body precipitates another
- from different [insertion]acid[/insertion] solutions
the same quantity of
one always precipitates
the same quantity of the
other. -
- And hence the different
chemical elements may be
expressed by numbers &
all their combinations
represented by [insertion]simple[/insertion] additions of
these numbers. -

[page]26|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00026|dnp04c224pp|82513584[/page]
 - To find the number representing
an element it is necessary
only to find the smallest
proportion in which it
combines; - Thus one
volume of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] unites
to 1 of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] & their
weights are as [deletion]3[/deletion] 1 to 33.5.
let [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] be represented
by unity & [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] by
33.5 - (Then water
contains 2 of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
in volume to 1 of [deletion]Hy[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_022|oxy[superscript]e[/superscript][/chemical]
& their relative weights are
1 to 15; suppose two proportions
of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] in Water; then
the number representing
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] will be [underline]15[/underline]. - &
15 of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] with 2. 33.5
of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] forms [chemical]chemical_307|[underline]Euchlorine[/underline][/chemical];

[page]27|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00027|dnp04c225pp|82513595[/page]

- & when ever [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_022|[insertion]or oxygene[/insertion][/chemical] combine
[deletion]xx[/deletion] they will always be to each
other as 15 to [deletion]33[/deletion] 67. -
- I shall have numerous opportunities
of illustrating [underline]these principles[/underline]; -
some of which will perhaps
appear abstruse; - but if the
propositions be considered as uniform
parts or particles, there can
be no difficulty in understanding
the doctrine
Instance
- On
this part of the Science
it is necessary to gain
distinct ideas; - [deletion]It is the[/deletion]

of [deletion]the[/deletion] our experiments;
& their coincidence, or

depended upon chance or
upon multiplied exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
[deletion]or diversified trials[/deletion]
or upon manipulations

from one [deletion]race of man[/deletion] generation of

- The knowledge of the true

- The [underline]doctrine[/underline] of definite
proportions is a work of
recent origin - I have
I fear already taken up
too much of your time

rudiments of this important
elucidation of Chemistry.
The alchemists & the early

the celebrated Professor of
Chemistry of [place]place_283|Upsal[/place]

- During the progress of
the pneumatic Chemistry; - The
[person]person_036|Newtonian[/person] Doctrine of Elective
affinity [insertion]or the selection of one body to the exclusion of a third[/insertion] was taken for granted.
- the manner in which the
gasses combined shewed that
[underline]the results[/underline] of their attractions
[underline]were uniform[/underline]. [person]person_165|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Higgins[/person]
now professor of Chemistry
in Dublin in 1789. endeavored
to [deletion]shew[/deletion][insertion]prove[/insertion] that "bodies combined
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] according to a corpuscular
arrangement." - one particle
with one or one with
two or in some definite
number; - but the idea
was develloped in an
imperfect manner; & not with

[page]36|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00036|dnp04c234pp|82513697[/page]
little attention from the
greater number of Chemists
who at this time were
employed rather in collecting
facts & combatting respecting
hypothetical substances; than
in refining & arranging
the Science; & [person]person_165|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Higgins[/person]
views were develloped in
a controversial book respecting
[chemical]chemical_046|Phlogiston[/chemical]. -
In 1795 - [person]person_341|Richter[/person]
shewed that when two
neutral salts mutually
decomposed each other
there was no excess of
acid or base. - He
likewise shewed that when
one metal precipitated another

[page]37|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00037|dnp04c235pp|82513709[/page]
from its solution; the metal
only changed so that the
same relative proportions
of acid & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] existed in
all metallic salts. - This
discovery founded upon precise
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] offers the true devellopment
of the law of definite [underline]proportions[/underline].
& [person]person_341|Richter[/person] formed upon it a
series of numbers representing
the alkalies & acids.
In [deletion]17[unclear]0[/unclear][/deletion] 1804. M[superscript]r[/superscript]
[person]person_066|Dalton[/person] [deletion]develloped[/deletion] [insertion]brought forwards[/insertion] in this
theatre what He called the
atomic system of Chemistry.
- In which He supposes
the chemical elements
to be indestructible particles
- which by their different
arrangements produce the

[page]38|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00038|dnp04c236pp|82513722[/page]
different secondary compounds. -
- In 1808. - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Gay
[person]person_012|Lussac[/person] endeavored to
shew that in the
combination of gaseous
bodies, the volumes were
always in some
simple ratio, one &
one or one & two or
one three; & that
the condensation in combi
nation is likewise in
a ratio; of half the
volume or a third of
the volume.
- In the last year
Mr [person]person_349|Berzelius[/person] [place]place_977|[insertion]of Stockholm[/insertion][/place] published
a paper on definite

proportions following the
views of [person]person_341|Richter[/person] &
applying them to the
combinations of elements
 with each other; & making
the combination of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
the measure of [underline]all quantity[/underline].
- The views which have
arisen from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
[person]person_341|Richter[/person] have been opposed
by [deletion]one Chemist[/deletion] M[superscript]r[/superscript]
[person]person_005|Berthollet[/person] of the Institut
[deletion]of[/deletion] [place]place_897|[underline]France[/underline][/place] & [insertion]He has been fo[/insertion] followed by the
[insertion]greater number of the Disciples of[/insertion] French School of Chemistry.
He supposes that combinations
depend not merely upon y[superscript]e[/superscript]
attraction of the acting
bodies; but likewise upon

[page]40|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00040|dnp04c238pp|82513739[/page]
their quantities & that
in truth no elective
[underline]attractions exist[/underline]. - I
shall have occasion in
the course of these
lectures to refer to some
of his exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] - the
results when they are
correct [deletion]I shall to shew[/deletion] [insertion]appear to me[/insertion]
[deletion]are[/deletion] favorable to the
system they are meant
to oppose - (& not
even the efforts of

[page]41|MS-DAVY-10442-000-00041|dnp04c239pp|82513746[/page]
the results of her

- It is not necessary
to suppose with M[superscript]r[/superscript]
[person]person_165|Higgins[/person] & [person]person_066|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton[/person]
that Matter consists
of [deletion]ind[/deletion] Atoms capable

- Or with Mr [person]person_349|Berzelius[/person]
that one element governs
all [deletion]com[/deletion] the proportions of

whatever theory be framed
of the ultimate nature
of matter; still its
powers may be estimated
in the same manner
& their results submitted
to calculation. - We
are [underline]not[/underline] acquainted with
[underline]the nature[/underline] of the matter
