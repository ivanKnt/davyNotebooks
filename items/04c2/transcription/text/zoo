[underline]Chemical Attraction[/underline]
I have already spoken of [underline]chemical[/underline]
[underline]attraction[/underline] as the power opposed
to expansion or the [underline]agencies[/underline] of
Heat. - I have stated that
the most important phaenomena
of chemical change depend
upon the operation of these
two forces.: the one tending
to unite the other to
separate the particles of
Matter.
- It will be necessary to
enter into a discussion of
[deletion]upon[/deletion] - the Laws of Chemical
Attraction & to illustrate them

[page]4||dnp04c202pp|82513360[/page]
by experiments. - On this
occasion should I be
minute & tedious & dwell
too long upon familiar
instances I must beg you
 to pardon me. - (The
subject forms as it were
the scaffolding by which
the edifice of Chemical
Philosophy is to be erected;
- And it is necessary that
it should be constructed
with care; - that its
parts should be firm &
well connected. - In
some cases it is not
possible to adorn the
truths of the Science; &

[page]5||dnp04c203pp|82513372[/page]
[deletion]there are some [insertion]important[/insertion] propositions which[/deletion]
[deletion]will not [insertion]connect [unclear]also[/unclear][/insertion] admit either of novel[/deletion]
[deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] or[/deletion]
they must be studied for their
own sake; - (Whenever it is
in my power to bring forward
novel experiments - or
general philosophical views
or illustrations connected
with the order of nature
or the processes of the
Arts. - I shall not fail
to make the attempt;
& if I should be unsuccessful
in awaking interest or giving
amusement in the development
of the didactic principles of
the Science, I must pray
you to have the indulgence
to attribute it

[page]6||dnp04c204pp|82513382[/page]
not to my [deletion]want of[/deletion][insertion]deficiency in[/insertion]
zeal or of desire; not
 to an [deletion]deficiency[/deletion] of indisposi-
tion to exertion; but to
a want of ability.
Chemical Attraction is
the power by which the
parts of different bodies
unite: & stand with
each other & form a
new & a different substance
- Some Bodies are possessed
of no Chemical Attraction
for each other - Others
exert it with different
 degrees of force. -

[page]7||dnp04c205pp|82513398[/page]
- I shewed in the introductory
lecture that the Alkali called
[underline]Soda[/underline] united with great violence
[insertion]of action[/insertion] to oil of vitriol; & that
Copper has a stronger Attraction
for aquafortis or Nitric acid
than Mercury has so that
it is thrown down from its
solution by it.
-: The Law of [underline]combination[/underline] or
the union by chemical
 Attraction applies to all
the different ponderable
forms of Matter. - fluids
not only produce solid
matter; but [insertion]in some cases[/insertion] likewise gaseous
matter; & Gasses are condensed
into [underline]fluids or[/underline] solids; -

are changed & their visible
properties in these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
so likewise are their
other sensible qualities

[page]9||dnp04c207pp|82513417[/page]
- The gas from the [underline]aquafortis[/underline]
& [underline]alcohol[/underline]; has a taste
& smell entirely different from
the substances from which it rises.
- This fluid from olefiant
gas which is a [unclear]tastles[/unclear] body
possessed of a [deletion]dis[/deletion] very disagreeable
smell - & from Chlorine
which is acrid & highly
offensive is aromatic &
agreeable in its taste & smell.
- And the neutral salt
from the acid gasses has
a mild flavour & no perceptible
odour; - Though [insertion]all of[/insertion] its elements
could not have been safely
applied to the palate or the

[page]10||dnp04c208pp|82513425[/page]

- Many different bodies are
capable of uniting into one

[page]11||dnp04c209pp|82513433[/page]
- Illustrations of chemical attraction
may be found in a variety
of the common processes &
arts of life . -
- The saccharine or [insertion]mucilaginous[/insertion] [deletion]astringent[/deletion]
matters in the vegetables & the
gelatinous [deletion]fluids[/deletion] substances from
animals are dissolved for
the purposes of food; - &
even culinary processes are
within the dominion of
Chemistry . - In the Art
of tanning; the organized substance
of skin is slowly combined
with astringent [deletion]& extractive[/deletion] [insertion]matters[/insertion]
[deletion]substances[/deletion]; which have been
extracted from the bark
of the oak by [deletion]boil[/deletion] Water:

[page]12||dnp04c210pp|82513440[/page]
 & two substances [deletion]wh[/deletion] both soluble
[insertion]in water &[/insertion] liable to decay & decompose
become in their union -
[deletion]permanent[/deletion] as leather insoluble
permanent [deletion]& capable of[/deletion]
[deletion]resisting the action of air[/deletion]
& comparatively indestructible
- In dyeing colours are
immediately fixed upon 1 cloth
as when silk is plunged
into solution of indigo; &
in this case the colouring
matter has a stronger attraction
for the [deletion]clo[/deletion] stuff than for
its solvent; or made
to unite as in the case
of the reds of madder by
the intervention of some
other body, such as

[page]13||dnp04c211pp|82513451[/page]
salts having a basis of clay;
& by the triple combination colours
are not only made brighter
but likewise less liable to
change. -
- In bleaching colouring matters
are [deletion]dissolved by[/deletion] [deletion]changed by[/deletion] [insertion]are combined with[/insertion]
[deletion]the action[/deletion] of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]oxygene[/insertion] air & washed
out by water. -
- In the [underline]soap[/underline] manufactury
tallow & fossile alkali are
combined; & a substance of
great importance in civilized
life is the result of the
mere chemical attractive
forces between two bodies
- In the manufacture of true
China two earths are called
[underline]Petunse[/underline] the other [underline]Kaolin[/underline]

- molded into the appropriate form

in consequence of the

formed in a similar
manner by a mixture
of alkali [deletion]&[/deletion] sand &
litharge; a perfect fusion
is produced, 1 & the form

whilst it is soft. -
- (These instances might be
multiplied to a great extent
& the oeconomy of Nature
would furnish abundant illustrations

of another kind :/- Water is
constantly dissolving saline
& organizable matters; which
[deletion]become[/deletion] [insertion]are converted into[/insertion] the food of plants.
& elements that would be
noxious on the surface of
the earth or in the atmosphere
[deletion]are rendered[/deletion] become in the
organs of vegetables salutary
& useful & form a
part of the [deletion]food[/deletion] [insertion]subsistence[/insertion] of
Man. -
One of the elements of
the air is constantly entering
into new combinations its
attractions are exerted upon
a number of forms of
dead matter; which it renders
subservient to the purposes of

[page]16||dnp04c214pp|82513481[/page]
life; & it acts upon living
beings; (& by its chemical
powers it is essential to their
[deletion]life[/deletion]. existence
- I mentioned in the introductory
lecture that [underline]bodies[/underline] which
attract each [underline]other chemically[/underline]
[underline]unite[/underline] in [underline]definite proportions[/underline].
This Law [deletion]is[/deletion] perhaps the
most important belonging to
our [underline]Science[/underline]; [deletion]It will[/deletion]
[deletion]therefore be proper & it[/deletion]
admits of elucidation
by a number of experiments.

- In all well defined chemical
compounds there is the same
principle of combination [insertion]Different [deletion]Variations[/deletion] [insertion]specimens[/insertion] of the same[/insertion]- . Salts
consisting of the same elements

[page]18||dnp04c216pp|82513498[/page]
contain them in the same
proportions & exhibit the
same chrystaline forms;
Thus in whatever manufactory
[underline]alum[/underline] is made - it contains
identical quantities of alkali
earth & acid & its chrystals
are eight sided figures.
- Common salt whether formed
from sea water, or from rock
salt or from salt springs
always appears in cubes
& consists of the same
elements. - In the
variety of forms in nature
there is a similar
relationship. - Thus this
 substance [deletion]though[/deletion] fluor spar
whether found in Derbyshire
in Cornwall or in [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]

[page]19||dnp04c217pp|82513509[/page]

Saxony in Asia or America
is always cubical or [underline]Octaedral[/underline]
& the same in compaction. -
[deletion]common[/deletion] [insertion]And all our[/insertion] [underline]Calcareous spars[/underline] whatever may
be [deletion]their[/deletion] diversity of appearance
may be resolved into the Rhomboidal
form; & the proportions of its
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]elements are invariably[/insertion] eight & a half of
Calcareous earth & 6 & a half
of acid gas. - In all
the well defined chrystalline productions
of the mineral kingdom there
is the same principle of
uniformity. - similarity of
appearance indicates similarity
of composition; - [deletion]Nature Chemistry[/deletion] [insertion]Nature[/insertion]
acts by this [underline]fixed[/underline] &
 [underline]immutable law[/underline]; & [deletion]her[/deletion] her
arrangements however diversified

[page]20||dnp04c218pp|82513520[/page]
follow a [deletion]simple[/deletion] [insertion]certain[/insertion] order; - . The
circumstances of chrystalization
& definite proportion form
[underline]the alphabet[/underline] by which [deletion]the chemical[/deletion] [insertion]her chemical[/insertion]
[underline]language[/underline] [insertion][deletion]of Nature[/deletion][/insertion] [insertion][deletion]of the terrestrial system[/deletion][/insertion] is to be decyphyred.
& it is not composed of
numerous hieroglyphics: but
of a few simple characters;
[deletion]& the language of Nature[/deletion]
[deletion]is as it were the an[/deletion]
[deletion]archetype, of[/deletion] [insertion]coincident with[/insertion] the best
[deletion]language[/deletion] [insertion]combinations[/insertion] of human reason
When two bodies combine
the relations "of their quantities
are always definite" but
the sometimes combine in
more than one proportion
& it is a very important
law of combination; that

[page]21||dnp04c219pp|82513535[/page]
the second proportion is always
a [underline]multiple[/underline]; or a divisor
of the first. -
- There is a substance called
[underline]fluorboric acid[/underline] - - combines
with two portions of [underline]Ammonia[/underline]
- one in volume - [underline]& 2[/underline]
in [underline]volume[/underline].
So that the first salt
[underline]contains half as much[/underline] alkali
[underline]as the second[/underline]
[underline]- Carbonate of Potassa -[/underline]
[deletion]half[/deletion] [underline]equal weights[/underline] - [underline]half[/underline]
[underline]twice as much -[/underline]
Mercury - 1[deletion]0[/deletion]10 - parts - 4
& 8. -
other instances

[page]22||dnp04c220pp|82513544[/page]
- Iron burns in oxygene
104 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] take [deletion]29[/deletion] 30
of [underline]oxygene[/underline] & [deletion]the 1/2[/deletion] [insertion]15[/insertion] zinc
to become - red . oxide.
- [underline]Whenever[/underline] in combinations of
one kind a body is
found in a certain proportion
[insertion]then[/insertion] when[deletion]ever[/deletion] it enters into
combination with another
body it is either in
the same proportion, or
a multiple; such as twice
as much, thrice - or a
division as half as much
- Thus [underline]Sulphur[/underline] combines
with [deletion]copper[/deletion] [underline]Iron[/underline]; &
with oxygene. And 30 p[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of Sulphur combine with
30 of oxygene [deletion]& - 30 parts[/deletion]
to make an acid gas

& [deletion]3.[/deletion] 10[unclear]0[/unclear] parts of [deletion]oxyg[/deletion] iron combine
with 30 of oxygene to make
 black [underline]oxide of Iron[/underline]. _& 10[deletion]6[/deletion]4
p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of iron combine with
30 parts of sulphur to
 form common pyrites. -
- Again - Chlorine [deletion]as was[/deletion]
[deletion]shewn[/deletion] combines with one
of [deletion]oxygene[/deletion] Hydrogene. - [deletion]in[/deletion] volume
& 2 of Hydrogene in volume
combine with one of Chlorine [insertion]oxygen[/insertion]
 - & - [underline]one of[/underline] [deletion]Chlorine[/deletion] Oxygene
combines with [deletion]a half[/deletion] two
[deletion]a volume of oxygene.[/deletion]
of chlorine.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
It is in consequence
of these circumstances that

[page]24||dnp04c222pp|82513567[/page]
whenever compounds decompose
each other [deletion]in consequence[/deletion] [insertion]by[/insertion]
of double attraction or
double affinity: there
is always [underline]merely[/underline] a
new arrangement of their
[underline]elements[/underline] & none of
the substances are found
in excess or deficiency.
- Thus when the salt
called Nitrate of Barytes
is mixed with the salt
called Sulphate of Potash;
- The Potash unites to the
Nitr[deletion]ous[/deletion]ic acid: the
Barytes to the Sulphuric
acid & the mixture
is as neutral as
before.

[page]25||dnp04c223pp|82513577[/page]
Again, when Muriatic acid
gas is made to act
is made to act
upon oxide of [underline]Mercury[/underline]. -
- Mercury [insertion]The chlorine of the acid[/insertion]
[insertion]combines with the metal[/insertion]
oxygene & hydrogene
combine to [underline]form water[/underline].
 - It is in consequence of this
simple law that whenever
one body precipitates another
- from different [insertion]acid[/insertion] solutions
the same quantity of
one always precipitates
the same quantity of the
other. -
- And hence the different
chemical elements may be
expressed by numbers &
all their combinations
represented by [insertion]simple[/insertion] additions of
these numbers. -

[page]26||dnp04c224pp|82513584[/page]
 - To find the number representing
an element it is necessary
only to find the smallest
proportion in which it
combines; - Thus one
volume of Hydrogene unites
to 1 of Chlorine & their
weights are as [deletion]3[/deletion] 1 to 33.5.
let Hydrogene be represented
by unity & Chlorine by
33.5 - (Then water
contains 2 of Hydrogene
in volume to 1 of [deletion]Hy[/deletion] oxy[superscript]e[/superscript]
& their relative weights are
1 to 15; suppose two proportions
of Hydrogene in Water; then
the number representing
oxygene will be [underline]15[/underline]. - &
15 of Oxygene with 2. 33.5
of Chlorine forms [underline]Euchlorine[/underline];

[page]27||dnp04c225pp|82513595[/page]
7
- & when ever chlorine [insertion]or oxygene[/insertion] combine
[deletion]xx[/deletion] they will always be to each
other as 15 to [deletion]33[/deletion] 67. -
- I shall have numerous opportunities
of illustrating [underline]these principles[/underline]; -
some of which will perhaps
appear abstruse; - but if the
propositions be considered as uniform
parts or particles, there can
be no difficulty in understanding
the doctrine
Instance
- On
this part of the Science
it is necessary to gain
distinct ideas; - [deletion]It is the[/deletion]
[deletion]foundation[/deletion] The Doctrines of chemical
affinity become the instruments

[page]28||dnp04c226pp|82513609[/page]
for comparing the results
of [deletion]the[/deletion] our experiments;
& their coincidence, or
want of coincidence with
the law of proportions; [deletion]become[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion]
tests of their accuracy
& their imperfection. -
- These doctrines are capable
of being made [deletion]no less[/deletion]
the guides in [deletion]Philosophical[/deletion]
Practical as well as
philosophical Chemistry; - They may
teach the artist & manufacturer
what proportions of substances
are necessary for his
combinations: - & enable
him to pursue new processes

[page]29||dnp04c227pp|82513621[/page]
with precision & certainty: -
 - Hitherto the results of
chemical operations have
depended upon chance or
upon multiplied exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
[deletion]or diversified trials[/deletion]
or upon manipulations
transmitted as secrets
from one [deletion]race of man[/deletion] generation of
 manufacturers to another. -
- The knowledge of the true
laws of [deletion]chemistry[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]proportion[/deletion] combination[/insertion] whilst
it fixes the principles
of ancient processes points
out the methods of
improvement. & leads
at once to security; &
enterprise. [deletion]& in this[/deletion]
[deletion]respect it will effect[/deletion]

[page]30||dnp04c228pp|82513629[/page]
[deletion]for the technical Chemistry[/deletion]
[deletion]which astronomy effected[/deletion]
[deletion]for navigation[/deletion] -
- The [underline]doctrine[/underline] of definite
proportions is a work of
recent origin - I have
I fear already taken up
too much of your time
but I will ask for
a few minutes more.
whilst I give an outline
of the progress of this
department of Science whilst
I endeavor to do justice
to the enlightened [deletion]&[/deletion]
[deletion]able[/deletion] Philosophers to
whom we owe the

[page]31||dnp04c229pp|82513640[/page]
8
rudiments of this important
elucidation of Chemistry.
The alchemists & the early
chemists explained all attraction
all chemical changes; by
some rude mechanical ideas
Acids were supposed to
[deletion]combine with alkalies, because[/deletion]
[deletion]their particles were[/deletion] [underline]sharp &[/underline]
[deletion][underline]pointed[/underline][/deletion]; be composed of pointed
particles; which combined with
alkalies because the alkalies
were porous or spongy bodies
fitted to receive these points; -
- Or certain ethers, or soluble
fluids were assumed which give
to bodies, the power of
changing each other; & the sensible

[page]32||dnp04c230pp|82513651[/page]
qualities of [deletion]bodies[/deletion] [insertion]chemical agents[/insertion] were
referred to these Ethers or
spirits. - Towards the
end of the 17 century.
- The same [deletion]great[/deletion] [insertion]illustrious[/insertion] Man who
[deletion][underline]created[/underline] as it were[/deletion]
discovered the Law by
which the great masses
of Matter composing the
universe preserve their
order & perform their
motions; likewise gave
the first distinct view
of the causes of y[superscript]e[/superscript] chemical
phaenomena; - Newton
explained solution & combination
& decomposition by supposing
different attractive forces

[page]33||dnp04c231pp|82513659[/page]
belonging to the different
species of Matter; - (& having
in his [underline]earlier [deletion]works[/deletion][/underline] labours
applied one principle by
the most refined calculations
to the system of the heavens;
In his later works; - He
endeavoured by simple exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
to found a [deletion]system[/deletion] on
a similar basis, the
changes & the [deletion]mechanism[/deletion] [insertion]constitution[/insertion]
of the bodies belonging
to the earth.
- Geoffry of the Royal
Academy of Sciences in
1704 - endeavoured to
express the forces of Attraction

[page]34||dnp04c232pp|82513671[/page]
of bodies for each other; &
[underline]made tables[/underline] which He
called tables of affinity
making use of this
word to express the same
idea as Newtons word
attraction. -
About 17[deletion]6[/deletion]75. Bergman
the celebrated Professor of
Chemistry of Upsal
in Sweden attempted
to express the forces with
which bodies combined
numerically; & He was
followed by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan
who a few years afterwards
published a number of
elaborate exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on
the phaenomena of double
decomposition

[page]35||dnp04c233pp|82513683[/page]

- During the progress of
the pneumatic Chemistry; - The
Newtonian Doctrine of Elective
affinity [insertion]or the selection of one body to the exclusion of a third[/insertion] was taken for granted.
- the manner in which the
gasses combined shewed that
[underline]the results[/underline] of their attractions
[underline]were uniform[/underline]. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Higgins
now professor of Chemistry
in Dublin in 1789. endeavored
to [deletion]shew[/deletion][insertion]prove[/insertion] that "bodies combined
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] according to a corpuscular
arrangement." - one particle
with one or one with
two or in some definite
number; - but the idea
was develloped in an
imperfect manner; & not with

[page]36||dnp04c234pp|82513697[/page]
little attention from the
greater number of Chemists
who at this time were
employed rather in collecting
facts & combatting respecting
hypothetical substances; than
in refining & arranging
the Science; & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Higgins
views were develloped in
a controversial book respecting
Phlogiston. -
In 1795 - Richter
shewed that when two
neutral salts mutually
decomposed each other
there was no excess of
acid or base. - He
likewise shewed that when
one metal precipitated another

[page]37||dnp04c235pp|82513709[/page]
from its solution; the metal
only changed so that the
same relative proportions
of acid & oxygene existed in
all metallic salts. - This
discovery founded upon precise
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] offers the true devellopment
of the law of definite [underline]proportions[/underline].
& Richter formed upon it a
series of numbers representing
the alkalies & acids.
In [deletion]17[unclear]0[/unclear][/deletion] 1804. M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Dalton [deletion]develloped[/deletion] [insertion]brought forwards[/insertion] in this
theatre what He called the
atomic system of Chemistry.
- In which He supposes
the chemical elements
to be indestructible particles
- which by their different
arrangements produce the

[page]38||dnp04c236pp|82513722[/page]
different secondary compounds. -
- In 1808. - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Gay
Lussac endeavored to
shew that in the
combination of gaseous
bodies, the volumes were
always in some
simple ratio, one &
one or one & two or
one three; & that
the condensation in combi
nation is likewise in
a ratio; of half the
volume or a third of
the volume.
- In the last year
Mr Berzelius [insertion]of Stockholm[/insertion] published
a paper on definite

[page]39||dnp04c237pp|82513730[/page]
10
proportions following the
views of Richter &
applying them to the
combinations of elements
 with each other; & making
the combination of oxygene
the measure of [underline]all quantity[/underline].
- The views which have
arisen from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
Richter have been opposed
by [deletion]one Chemist[/deletion] M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Berthollet of the Institut
[deletion]of[/deletion] [underline]France[/underline] & [insertion]He has been fo[/insertion] followed by the
[insertion]greater number of the Disciples of[/insertion] French School of Chemistry.
He supposes that combinations
depend not merely upon y[superscript]e[/superscript]
attraction of the acting
bodies; but likewise upon

[page]40||dnp04c238pp|82513739[/page]
their quantities & that
in truth no elective
[underline]attractions exist[/underline]. - I
shall have occasion in
the course of these
lectures to refer to some
of his exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] - the
results when they are
correct [deletion]I shall to shew[/deletion] [insertion]appear to me[/insertion]
[deletion]are[/deletion] favorable to the
system they are meant
to oppose - (& not
even the efforts of
humour [insertion]ingenuity[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] are capable
of comprising the
arrangements of Nature;
or of altering [insertion]them[/insertion] except
in an uniform manner,

[page]41||dnp04c239pp|82513746[/page]
the results of her
