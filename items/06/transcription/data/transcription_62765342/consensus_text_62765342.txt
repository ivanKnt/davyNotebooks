Oct.[superscript]r[/superscript] 7 [deletion]9[/deletion] [superscript]th[/superscript] About half a pound of some
Basalt from a Dike near Belfast was
distilled sulphurated Hydrogene gas
came over probably half a pint, but 
no carbonaceous matter.
To ascertain {
whether {

the coal {
Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 9 Distilled some shale ale[/unclear] from above
the blind coal strata beneath the great
pillars of Fairhead.
This produced no Bitumen but a very large
quantity of inflammable gas, & sulphuretted
Hydrogene. -
[marginal note]Doubts {
as to {
the results {
of some
Distilled some of the wood coal from
below Basalt. This gave a small
quantity of Bitumen: The apparatus in
all these experiments was merely a
[unclear]retort[/unclear] with a curved neck so that probably
some Bitumen passed over [unclear]with[/unclear] the gas
The experiments shall be carried on
tomorrow by regular distillation

in an open fire Its colour changed very
little but it took a shade nearer to purple.
Heated some of the Fullers Earth in an
open fire its colour changed from [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] brown
to fawn colour & from being very soft
it became sufficiently hard to scratch glass. -
