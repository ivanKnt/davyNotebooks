19 50 grains of flint with . . 100 of Potash
gave a clear glass tinged green -

the Muriatic Sol: of the Alkali & red flint
with Ammoni was a tinge of [unclear]old[/unclear] brown
with precipitate of Potash light [underline]blue[/underline] [unclear]green[/unclear]

The White flint certainly contains less
Lime than the red [underline]flint[/underline] scarcely
any sensible quantity; the iron not
