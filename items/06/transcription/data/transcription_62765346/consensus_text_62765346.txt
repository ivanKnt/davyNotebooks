50 grains of the residual gas were mixed
with 120 grains of oxygene
45 grains more were added
28 150 grains of gas from Basalt left a residuum
of 35 which was inflammable
145 grains of gas
The 40 grains of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] white outside crust of
flint gave 36 grains of Silex -
28 The Basalt about 2 OZ gave [insertion]about[/insertion] 19 cubic inches
Its quantity was 680 grains. -
It consisted of Carbonic Acid
[deletion]x[/deletion] 4 parts. Carbonated Hydrogene 1
100 measures of the Carbon Hydrogene
[insertion]green light[/insertion] with 100 oxy. diminished to 80 - [unclear]noses[/unclear]
gave no indication of Sulph[superscript]c[/superscript] Acid
but gave 41 of Carbonic Acid . - the remaining
gas mixed with 80 of Nitrous gas
diminished to 5 - to that the
residuum was pure oxygene.
[Horizontal rule]
Found to day that Borate of Soda
precipitates [unclear]Argil[/unclear]. -
The green [unclear]S[superscript]e[/superscript][/unclear] oxide of iron slowly
The red instantly - from Sulp
Does not precip[superscript]e[/superscript] muriate of [underline]Magnesia[/underline]
Succinate of Ammoniac acts very slowly
upon Green S[superscript]e[/superscript]. of Iron.-
- Nitromuriate of Platina is a good
test for Sulphate of Potash. It precipitates
it but not sulphate of Soda. -
29 The residium of the 40 grains after sep[superscript]n[/superscript]
of silex weighed 1 3/4
-The 100 grains of red flint gave 93 of Silex -
The residuum of the solution ie the iron & other
earths together weighed 6 grains
