When water was poured upon the residuum of
the dist[superscript]n[/superscript] of Borate of Sod: & Sulphate of Iron
much heat was produced.

The object of this days experiment was to ascertain
whether an alkali [unclear]&[/unclear] or an acid are produced by Gal
vanic Electricity from pure Water exposed to Air for
this purpose different sets of tubes W[superscript]h[/superscript] Platina Wires
were made use of. the connecting substance was
Asbestos.

In the first experiment Acetite of Barytes in
solution Was Electrified in glass tubes, after about
two hours it was found by means of paper tongs

employed in pure Water. The liquid in the positive
tube in a few minutes gave signs of the presence of
an acid, that in the negative tube signs of the
presence of an Alkaline matter
The acid produced no precipitate in the Sulphat
