of Carbonate of Lime that had been so often
experimented upon gave nothing but pure
lime which was evident by its taste &
[marginal note]29.[/marginal note] by its power of precipitating Carbonate
of Ammonia. After repeating this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
several times - a little sulph[superscript]e[/superscript]
of Potash was added when the
fixed alkali was develloped in
a few minutes tried agate tubes
which seem indefinitely to furnish
[marginal note]30[/marginal note] alkali when exposed to [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] quantities
of water in the platina cup - but
which when with their natural
quantity of water only ie when filled
gives no perceptible quantity. Qu?
