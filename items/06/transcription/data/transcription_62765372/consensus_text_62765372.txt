immediately after but in about 3 minutes it
had changed to blue. As blue paper was kept
in contact with the asbest: but no sol: of

[marginal note]Observation[/marginal note] - In these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. it is absolutely necessary
to describe the strength of the Apparatus
& to use for the purpose some definite measure
We will likewise in future note down the

Laboratory & we will transfer a Barometer
here.
