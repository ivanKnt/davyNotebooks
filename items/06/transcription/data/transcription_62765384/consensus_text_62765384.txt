probably the smaller the quantities the more
ready will be the [underline]decomposition[/underline] to try this.
Mem tomorrow the decom[superscript]n[/superscript]. of Am[superscript]a[/superscript]
to see if Nitric acid is formed -
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Zinc when made to strike Sulphur
becomes [underline]positive[/underline] - the melting not against this
 [deletion]5,[unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
When Sulphuric acid was introduced into
one tube the negative, & Strontitic
water placed in [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]: & Distilled
[marginal note]90[/marginal note] water in Pos: - after six Hours there
was very little change the water precipitated
Muriate of Barytes only very slightly indeed - 
- In two gold tubes - [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Sulphuric acid
placed in Negative passed over into positive
[marginal note]91.[/marginal note] but only very slowly & after 12 Hours
there was still much Sulphuric acid
in neg. It would seem as if acid
was only very slowly repelled by the
[marginal note]Observati[/marginal note] negative pole [deletion]& a[/deletion] when pure; but
the presence of alkali [unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] adds to
the repellent agency of this pole.
In all exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] in which acid or alkali
is develloped in the opposite side of the
neutral Salt containing them the acid seems
[marginal note]92[/marginal note] first to appear near the positive pole & then
to collect itself about that pole & [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] is from
it at a point towards the negative pole.
- Made two Experiments - in both of which
[marginal note]93[/marginal note] sulphuric acid seemed to pass through strontites
but certainly in small quantities only. -
[marginal note]94[/marginal note] - Used SiPotas Neg. Ammon. neat - Distilled
water middle - in a minute litmus paper
near the Pos: Pole began to redden . -
