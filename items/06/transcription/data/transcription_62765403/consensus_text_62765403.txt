In Saturated Solution of Potash
containing large pieces of
of pure potash -
[underline]Alkaligen[/underline].- inflamed -
- In Sulphuric Acid very pure
it was very slowly acted upon
as long as it was kept
under the acid sulphate of
Potash apparently & sulphureous
acid being formed ; but when
brought upon the surface
it inflamed - Mem
if much [underline]potash[/underline] the action
will be [underline]more intense[/underline]
Saturated Solution of Potash [deletion]wet[/deletion]
in Ether formed a gaseous
combination when alkaligen
was introduced - 
It cannot be easily generated
under quicksilver because the
platina becomes so soon a non conductor
by being surrounded with dry
Potash .-
The gas produced from alkaligen
confined under mercury by the
contact of Water seemed to
be Hydrogene nearly pure
