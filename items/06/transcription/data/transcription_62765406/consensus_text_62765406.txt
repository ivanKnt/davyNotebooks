The gas from Ether when properly washed
seemed to be [underline]pure Hydrogene[/underline].
ie 1 part of it with 1 of oxygene
diminished to 1/2 & the residuum
gave copious white fumes with
Nitrous [underline]gas[/underline]. -
I examined this day & last night the
effect of Heat on the peculiar substance
when included in glass tubes &
likewise of oxygenation when a
small quantity of it was introduced
into a glass tube & rubbed up
& down upon it with a small
wire - white fumes were perceived
& an absorption of 1/5 took
 place [deletion]& the [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
When it was heated in
glass tubes of this kind
there was an increase of
air & a generation of Hydrogene
I believe -
When one of the Metallic globules
[underline]was produced[/underline] from a mass partly
surrounded by alkali & heat applied
it soon disappeared with a generation
of elastic fluid & a dense black
matter formed [underline]round the tube[/underline] & this
matter whether green glass or white
glass was used & dissolved in
Nitric Acid -
The green glass tube made use
 of when [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] filled with Hydrogene
& Heated red did not considerably
tarnish till it was near the melting
