& the residual gas extinguished flame. -
The fluid was evaporated which
had dissolved the Soda.
The oxygene absorbed equalled
56 grain measures of quicksilver
- Exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on the combustion of
Potagen .-
- The globule of Mercury equal
to the Potagen used weighed a
quarter of a grain & an eighth -
- It was introduced into oxygene
as free from Naptha as possible -
When it then became white on
the surface on applying a gentle
heat it reddened & fused but
without any luminous appearance -
- It became converted into
dry potash or at least Potash
dry to all appearance. - -
The residual gas was oxygene
apparently as pure as at
the commencement [underline]of the operation[/underline]
- The substance seemed converted into
pure [underline]potash[/underline] .-
77 mercurial grain measures of
oxygene were consumed
