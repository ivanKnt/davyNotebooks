When two pure globules-
one of Sodagen
The other of Potagen were [deletion]slowly[/deletion]

In the expt with Sodagen 7 grain
Measures of oxygene were consumed -
- In the expt with Potagen. 28 grain
measures in both cases the residual
oxygene was [underline]pure.[/underline]
The globule of Quicksilver corresponding
to the Potagen weighs 1/8 1/16 & 1/64
The globule from Sodagen weighed
1/8 -
