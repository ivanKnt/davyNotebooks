& a grey substance [insertion]in appearance like artificial[/insertion] [deletion]like[/deletion] sulphuret
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] of Iron is formed -
Which if kept in fusion
rapidly dissolves the glass

When this experiment is made

sealed no gas is liberated
when the tube is [deletion]broken[/deletion] [insertion]opened[/insertion] under mercury
but when it is made in
a tube connected with
a mercurial apparatus a
small quantity of Sulphuretted
hydrogen is evolved -
So that the phaenomena
are similar to the union
