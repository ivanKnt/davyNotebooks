A given quantity of Muriatic Acd
gas was acted upon by dry
charcoal, there was a continued
vivid light in the galvanic circuit
white fumes & metallic fumes ascended
in the tube . The platina wire fused
& became blackened.- The gas after
suffering this intense electrisation for
10 minutes was examined - It
had increased in volume how much culd
not be ascertained as - little escaped.-
When [insertion]a little[/insertion] Water was added no absorption
took place so that all the Muriatic
acid had been decomposed & the charcoal
/ which had not been consumed when
\\ taken out [unclear]tasted[/unclear] not at all.
The solution of Potash added took
up about 8/20 .-
A part of the remainder 1 in measure was
mixed with 2/3 of oxygene The diminution was to
to 1 1/6 more oxy[superscript]e[/superscript] was added but no detona[superscript]n[/superscript]. took
place Nitrous gas of purity 1/12 added
left a residu[superscript]m[/superscript]. of 4/5 all [unclear]visual[/unclear] estimat
In a second experiment upon the
detonation of y[superscript]e[/superscript] Residual Gas; after
the Carbonic Acid [underline]had been absorbed[/underline]
1 Measure was detonated with
1 oxygene - Residuum was 1 & 1/3
Introduced Sol: of Potash - diminution
to 1 . To this was added 1 1/2 of Nitrous
gas diminution to 1/2 & when fresh
[underline]oxygene[/underline] was added no new diminution
