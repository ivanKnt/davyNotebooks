- Tried by [unclear]electrization[/unclear] of Muriatic
acid with pieces of charcoal only
to collect the white or black Matter
but was not successful. -
When the Sparks were taken upon
pieces of charcoal however
there was a most vivid light
sometimes of the purest white
at other times tinted of a rose
red colour. -
