After the amalgams of the basis of Barytes & Stontites & merc[superscript]y[/superscript].
were distilled. there appeared to be about 5/6 merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. remain[superscript]g[/superscript]. to 1/6
of the bases. This proportion seemed to render the merc[superscript]y[/superscript] more fixed
as in both cases it bore a red heat. The basis both of barytes
& strontites appear to be easily separa[superscript]d[/superscript]. from the merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. after the distilla[superscript]n[/superscript]
as above. Though perhaps it is only a partial separation consisting
