Tried the experiments upon the
decomposition of the Earths by Iron wire
- . - with the happiest results. -
- When any of the alkaline
Earths was mixed with red precipitate
& Electrified in this way a
triple compound of iron basis
& mercury seemed to be formed -
& this when [unclear]out[/unclear] of the Sphere
of the - [unclear]U[/unclear]: rapidly [deletion]decomposed[/deletion]
burnt & the Earths were
reproduced -
With Silex & alumine the
results were distinct, but the
action upon water less.-
- [underline]Mem Boracic acid[/underline] & sulphur were
mixed together the acid being
artificially dried - by strong heat
they heated by the action of water
& when negatively electrified, gave to
Iron wire minus violent explosions
with a brilliant yellowi[deletion]ng[[/deletion]sh[/unclear] [underline]green light[/underline]
as if some aeriform matter was
develloped -
