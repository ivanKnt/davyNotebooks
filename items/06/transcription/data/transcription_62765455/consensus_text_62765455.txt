grs of Mercury was detona[superscript]d[/superscript]. with oxy[superscript]e[/superscript]. gas - in vol[superscript]e[/superscript]. to 52 grs of
merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. a diminu[superscript]n[/superscript]. took place = 108 grs of merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. - To the resi[superscript]al[/superscript]
gas oxy[superscript]e[/superscript]. was introduced = 15 grs of merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. but no further diminu[superscript]n[/superscript]. was
perceived by detona[superscript]n[/superscript]. Nitrous gas was then add[superscript]d[/superscript]. = 90 grs of merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. which
appeared to be wholly absorbed. - No further effect was visible when
more Nitrous gas was added. -

merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. suppose the power not suff[superscript]t[/superscript].

a number of globules of gas were distinctly seen. -
The amalgam of [insertion]the basis of[/insertion] Strontites & merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. when distilled exhibit[superscript]d[/superscript].
appearances similar to those before observed. When the utmost
heat of the lamp was given the basis appeared to combine
intimately with the glass. -
The amalgam of the basis of lime & merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. appeared to decompose
water instantly & to have its action greatly increased by the
addition of a little dilu[superscript]d[/superscript]. acid-
The amalgam of the basis of Barytes & merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. afforded similar
results to those before ascertained. -
No distinct effect with Silex the the battery was in great
