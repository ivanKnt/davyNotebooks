The triple amalgam of Potassium M. &
Ammonia may be made in
an [underline]instant[/underline] by [underline]exposing[/underline] Potass: Amalgam
to [deletion]the[/deletion] Muriate of [underline]Ammonia[/underline]. -
but if the Muriate of Ammonia be
perfectly dry, [underline]there is no action[/underline] -
[deletion]When the amalgam of Soda, & mercury & carb[superscript]e[/superscript]. of Ammonia
was introduced into OIl & Naptha no evolution of gas
took place . nor was there any effect - But when
the amalg[superscript]m[/superscript]. was [unclear]fixed[/unclear] from Naptha & [unclear]merely[/unclear] passed over
moistened paper & it then rapidly [deletion]xxxxx[/deletion] acted on the water
& produced a quantity of gas & ammonia in Naptha.
The amalgam of Soda merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. & [deletion]xxxxx[/deletion] ammonia produces much heat
during its formation on Carb[superscript]e[/superscript] ammonia with rapid evolution of
gas. -
Ammoniacal gas is slowly absorbed by oil.[/deletion]
When the amalgam of pot.[superscript]m[/superscript] & merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. was placed on Silex & red precip.
no distinct effect took place - [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]-
No decomposi[superscript]n[/superscript] of water. -
[deletion][unclear]In the amalgam of mercury & Lime water[/unclear][/deletion]
The mercury which was distilled from the amalgam of Lime
decomposed water [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] & continued
for a considerable time to evolve large globules of gas.-
If in the electriza[superscript]n[/superscript]. / of lime & merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. the basis of lime combine
with the merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. - /Would it not seem from the circumstance
that the basis is more volatile than that of Strontites barytes
As those large globules of gas were disengaged from the amalgam
of lime - [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] - they deposited on the surface of the fluid
a film of lime. -
The amalgam of Lime & merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. appears to decompose
Naptha.
