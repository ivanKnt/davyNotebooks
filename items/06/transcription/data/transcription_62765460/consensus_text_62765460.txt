Lime did not succeed so well as heretofore - but it
decomposed water. The effect was not [insertion]sufficiently[/insertion] distinct for distilla[superscript]n[/superscript]
tho' it was acted on for a considerable time when the battery
was in great activity.

Lime not sufficiently decomposed for distillation - tho' it slightly acted

The amalgam of lime distilled left a white metallic

decomposed water & reproduced Strontites. -
