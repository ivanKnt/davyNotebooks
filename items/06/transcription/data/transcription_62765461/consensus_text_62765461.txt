The reason [insertion]why[/insertion] lime did not succeed on the 18[superscript]th[/superscript] & 19[superscript]th[/superscript] seems to have
been in consequence of its particles not being sufficiently small.
for when pulverised it readily decomposed water & after distillation
good results were obtained. - - -
The amalgams of all the Earths hitherto tried as lime
barytes, strontite, magnesia &c seems to enlarge their volume
& evolve gas when placed on muria[superscript]e[/superscript] of ammonia
moistened with ammonia. -
Sulphur when acted on in contact with merc[superscript]y[/superscript].
appears to [deletion]xxxxx[/deletion] form an amalgam. which decomposes
water. - but alkaline matter is formed at the neg. pole
& perhaps interferes with this result. -
The amalgams of Alumine Silex, lime & magnesia
appear to decompose Naphtha. - but perhaps they
have never been introduced into it, in a state perfectly
freed from moisture. So that the evidence of its decomposi[superscript]n[/superscript].
by their agency does not seem to be satisfactory. -
When [insertion]moistened[/insertion] boracic acid is neg. elec[superscript]d[/superscript]. with mercury, the
merc[superscript]y[/superscript]. increases [insertion]considerably[/insertion] in volume [insertion]becomes butteraceous,[/insertion] somewhat similar to
carb[superscript]e[/superscript] or mur[superscript]e[/superscript]. of am: & decomposes water with facility
& a white cloud of boracic acid appears to rise &
remain on the surface of the water. -
It is probable that [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]fire[/insertion] [underline]is generated[/underline] during the action
on boracic acid & mercury - as it seems to be very
intense.[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] When a quantity was put into a glass
of water it decomposed it & white clouds in abundance
appeared rising to the surface. after some time - the action
in the glass became violent & almost immediately after
ceased altogether
A minute quanity of alkaline matter seems
to be present with bora[superscript]c[/superscript]. acid - but could this
occasion such an increase of volume? The effect
of potash & soda on mercury by the agency of galvanism
seems to be not to inlarge its volume but to increase
its solidity. - It would seem then that Boracic acid is
decomposed by this means. May it not be composed
of the same elements as ammonia? only differently
arranged
There seems to be no limit with regard to the formation
of the amalgams of boracic acid & mercury. -
