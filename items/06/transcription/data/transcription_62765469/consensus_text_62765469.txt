a diminution equal to its own [underline]volume[/underline]
- When the retort was broken
exposed to air; - the blackish
metallic mass took fire spontaneously
& burnt into [underline]Potash[/underline]. -
- The other [underline]part of it[/underline] emitted
Ammonia & produced Potash
with a great effervescence
by the action [underline]of water[/underline] -
& in this process
[underline]metallic films[/underline] of the colour
of Plat [underline]separated [/underline] not acted
upon by [underline]water[/underline] but soluble
in [underline]Nitric acid[/underline]; & a black
powder not sol: in Nitric
acid ?

The process was repeated
with [underline]4 grains[/underline] of Potassium
in a like quantity of
Ammonia -
In this after the heat
was applied it was [underline]withdrawn[/underline]
& the Potassium converted itself
into a greyish [underline]green mass[/underline]
& [unclear]about[/unclear] 3/5 of Gas - [unclear]remained[/unclear]
