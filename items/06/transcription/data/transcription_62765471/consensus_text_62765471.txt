When [deletion][unclear]the xxxx of[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Potassium[/insertion] was heated in contact with Am
moniacal gas. - It assumed a beautiful [insertion]light[/insertion] blue colour which
brightened as the heat became more intense . -
Oct[superscript]r[/superscript]. 30. - 1808.
The substance produced by the
action of [underline]Potassium[/underline] on Ammonia
is of a [deletion]tru[/deletion] deep olive colour
black in its interior parts
it is [underline]highly inflammable[/underline] & burns
when gently heated with [underline]vivid scintillations[/underline]
when water is made to act upon it
it effervesces most violently
& throws off [deletion]luminous[/deletion] scintillations
- It produces Ammonia by
[underline]oxydation[/underline]. - & [underline]Potash[/underline] -
Quere whether by combustion Nitrate
of Potash - No - [underline]for the Nitrous[/underline]
[underline]acid[/underline] no red fumes
with [underline]charcoal[/underline]
Seems to be [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]triple[/insertion] [underline]oxide[/underline] of Potassium
[underline]Hydrogene[/underline] & [underline]Nitrogene[/underline]
Heated Potassium about 4 grains
[underline]with[/underline] In Muriate of Am: about 10 .-
Muriate of Potash formed & a black
matter - quere from the Naptha
this looks like [underline]charcoal[/underline] burnt
[underline][deletion]when[/deletion][/underline] after it had been steeped
in aqua fortis with brilliant
scintillations - quere did it form
carbonate or muriate of [underline]Ammonia[/underline]
- Seems to be a compound of
Potassium with [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]something[/underline]
