8 Grains Potassium made to act
upon a quantity of [underline]Ammonia[/underline] .-
Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 4[superscript]th[/superscript]
6 Grains & half of Potassium were heated
in Hydrogen at first fumes were emitted
& the top of the retort became blue gradually
the top of the Potassium [underline]became[/underline] dark
coloured & it was apparently rendered
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] infusible - - there seemed no
absorption of gas in this process
though probably there [underline]was some[/underline] as
[underline]the water of the Hydrogene[/underline]
would have furnished a little
[underline]Hydrogene .[/underline] On applying heat
again the Metal came from
under [underline]its crust[/underline] & seemed
much less fusible than
Potassium in its common
[underline]form[/underline] - & it boiled by
a high [underline]heat[/underline] as if it
was giving off [underline]elastic matter[/underline]
- The Metal [underline]when cool[/underline] seemed
even brighter than pure
Potassium - & I am inclined
to consider it as an
[underline]amalgam[/underline] of Potassium &
[underline]Hydrogene[/underline].
Exhaustion was [underline]made & the[/underline]
metal [deletion]acted[/deletion] [unclear]xx[/unclear] acted on by Ammonia
- It instantly fused & became
converted into the fusible brown matter
5 Cubic Inches of the Gas from deoxygena[superscript]d[/superscript] Amm. were
preserved. one half of this proved to be Ammonia
or absorbable gas - the remainder pure hydrogene
