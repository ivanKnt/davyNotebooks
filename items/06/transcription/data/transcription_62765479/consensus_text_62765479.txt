1. That part of the barrel in the furnace [deletion]on which the[/deletion] [insertion]where[/insertion]
the iron turnings are situated must have a white heat
2. That part in contact with the Soda must be kept
quite cool until the 1[superscript]st[/superscript] process is accomplished.-
when [deletion]it[/deletion] [insertion]the soda[/insertion] must be fused & suffered to run gently down.-

Quere ? [deletion]That[/deletion] As Sodium has never been procured in
quantity - but always in minute particles forming a thin
film round the barrel - May not this be a consequence
of its combination with a minute quantity of iron which lessens
the attraction of cohesion between its particles & disposes them
thus to arrange themselves. Or perhaps it is merely for want
of a sufficient heat in the receiver that the particles of Sodium
do not form a solid mass.- But supposing the receiver was kept
at the fusing point of Sodium Might there not be some danger of its
inflammation ?
7 3/4 Grains of Potassium
November 11
In an experiment made on the ninth, twelve grains
of potassium were made to act on twenty cubic inches
of am[insertion]m[/insertion]onia [deletion]by[/deletion] the substance produced was distilled
in a green glass retort to redness; the retort being
exhausted from hydrogen, a piece of phosphorus was then
introduced an exhaustion was again made and the
whole heated, a violent action then took place
with [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] ignition a gas was disengaged which
possessed the properties of phosphurated azote
This day, seven & three grains of potassium were converted
into an oxyde by twelve cubic inches of ammonia
heat was applied, but the substance was not
heated to redness and this in like manner
