half a cubic inch of gas which
I believe was Hydrogene with
some Nitrogene quere' was
the absorption from the oxygene
or the Nitrogene being
taken up by Hydrogene
I suspect that the substance
perfects ie the conducting black
oxide will form a compound
with sulphur from which

[underline]As was the case[/underline]
in [underline]the[/underline] expt. just made
The gas not absorbed
from Sulphur & the
oxide was about 1/4 Sulphuretted
Hydrogene & the rest
probably Azote -
- 2 of the residual / whole [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
gas - with 2 of oxygene -
gives a [deletion]diminution[/deletion] [insertion]residuum[/insertion] = to
about 1 6/10 by detonation
ergo a mixture of Hydrogene
