3 1/2 Potassium in Phosphoreted
Hydrogene - about 2 . [deletion]6/4[/deletion] cubic
[insertion]about[/insertion] 4 grains of potassium in [insertion][unclear]about 20 xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] sulphuretted hydrogene
being exposed to the heat of a lamp, the bulk of the potassium was
increased, [deletion][unclear]x xxx[/unclear][/deletion] it presently inflamed, dense white fumes
arose, the potassium was converted into a [deletion]black[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] substance
around it was a sublimate of a fine yellow color,
there was an absorption of two cubic inches the [unclear]remain[/unclear]
gas burn'd like [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] sulphuretted[/deletion] hydrogene. [insertion]containing a small quantity of [unclear]sulp[/unclear][/insertion] & was slightly
absorbable in water. The red substance, was a perfect [unclear]sulph[/unclear]
of potash.
[marginal note]2[superscript]d[/superscript] exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/marginal note] When [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] phosphoretted hydrogene was introduced that whatever
[insertion]8 grains[/insertion] oxygene there might be, might be absorbed, it took fire as
before, reassumed it's metallic splendor, but it was soon
converted into a red substance , the [deletion]bottom[/deletion][insertion]sides[/insertion] of the retort
were covered with a fine sublimate. The results
were the same as in the last, except that the whole was not
converted into a [unclear]sulphate[/unclear] of potash, but part into a [unclear]sulpha[/unclear]
of potassium
[marginal note]3[superscript]d[/superscript] exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/marginal note] 4 grains of potassium with [insertion]20 cubic inches of[/insertion] phosphorated, hydrogene.
immediately on the retort being filled with the gas, a fine green
had spread itself over the potassium & green fumes arose, attended
with a violent action, a beautiful yellow sublimate arose, & [unclear]diffused[/unclear]
itself over the whole retort. the potassium seem'd to retain
its metallic lustre,- and there was no absorption.
This Phosphoret, exposed to water, two cubic inches were
generated from it.
3 grains of Potassium being acted on by 14 cubic inches, [insertion]of Olifiant[/insertion]
white fumes arose & covered the inside of tube with a white
sublimate. there was a slight absorption ; the remaining gas
burn'd like heavy hydro-carbonate. The white sublimate was
potash, coal was precipitated, & the Potassium destroyed
