10 1/2 grains of Potassium in about 10 cubical
inches of [underline]fluoric acid[/underline] . When gently heated
copious white fumes [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] probably from
the water [underline]of the gas[/underline]. [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] increase of
[underline]volume[/underline] , some little [underline]expulsion of gas[/underline] .-
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]retort [/underline]again became [underline]quite clear[/underline].
The metal moved from under its
[underline]crust[/underline] tarnished & became almost
black . then inflamed most
brilliantly .- great diminution
about 3 cubic inches of gas only
remaining. 1 [underline]of these fluoric[/underline].
The substance formed dark brown
like chocolate - slight inflammable decomposed
water emitting a smell like that of
phosphoretted Hydrogene. Six of the gas with 11 of
oxygene diminish to 10
[Horizontal rule]
When about 2 1/2 grains of potassium were heated in
pure [insertion]phosphuretted[/insertion] Muriatic acid a vivid inflammation took place
[deletion][unclear]xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] the substance remaining in the retort was of a
blackish Colour & underwent a partial spontaneous
inflammation by exposure to air .- When the substance
was heated in oxygene gas it burnt in a similar manner
to pyrophorus . - [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] / the [deletion]gas[/deletion] [insertion]muriatic acid [unclear]gas[/unclear][/insertion] [/insertion] was almost wholly absorbed
what remained was no more than might be supposed to
to be in the retort ie from exhaustion .
[underline]This substance[/underline] ie the residuum when
thrown upon water , burnt with vivid explosions.-
[Horizontal rule]
The gas from fluoric acid burnt
like p Hyd[superscript]e[/superscript] in the air
but gave a smell of fluoric acid
probably however this was
[underline]from[/underline] the [underline]vessel[/underline]
