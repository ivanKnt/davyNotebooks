- Capital Result from the
[underline]action[/underline] of Potassium on [underline]Ammonia[/underline]
12 cubical inches of Ammonia were acted
upon by 8 grains of Potassium -
- & after being converted into
the olive colored substance [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
the plate glass retort was exhausted
& 3 / 10 ( 3.3 the bottom heated
so as to be softened . -
the consequence was that only
3.3 [underline]66[/underline]
[underline]3.3[/underline] 2.4
6.6
5 only [insertion]two[/insertion] 5 cubical inches of gas were develloped
of which about an inch & half
were absorbable by water
- 15
After as much as could
be separated from the bottom of
the retort 5 had been acted upon
by [underline]10 Naptha[/underline] it gave off
a cubical inch & half of gas
when it was made red [underline]hot[/underline]
a quarter of a cubical inch of
which was absorbable
Likewise another portion of
which about 1/8 is absorbable. = to 2 cubic
 inches
This quantity amounted to 2 cubic inches { which about 1/8 is absorbable . = to 2 cubic inches
{ 7 of this last gas combi[superscript]e[/superscript]. with 6 of oxygene
{ diminished 9 1/2 ie there was left
[underline]3 & a half[/underline] . - here the heat was
nearly to whiteness .-
