The Absorption in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] in
the 1[superscript]st[/superscript] process ie upon the
Ammonia - was nearly [underline]6 cubical[/underline]
inches & half, the capacity
of the retort 16 cubical inches
& half - nearly 3 cubical
inches of Ammonia remained &
at least 6 cubical inches
of Hydrogene were generated -
-13 of the gas mingled with common
air ie these 13 contain the Hydrogene
& the common air
