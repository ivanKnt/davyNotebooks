The Nitrogene used in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was found by mixing
a portion of it with oxygene & by passing a spark thro' to be
entirely free from Hydrogene. [underline]On June 30[/underline]
[underline]1809[/underline]
A series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] having shewn that
Hydrogene is disengaged during the
action of Potassium on Nitrogene
- The exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was made with every
precaution -
a measured quantity of
Nitrogene was introduced into
a tube -
Some Potassium fused
in a little tray of platina
was ignited to whiteness ie
the vapour of the Potassium
by an app[superscript]s[/superscript] connected with
the battery of 1000 -
Nothing could exceed the [Ink sketch of apparatus runs vertically across this and next three lines on right-hand side]
[unclear]brilliancy[/unclear] of the phaenomenon
the platina at the point
seemed [underline]to burn[/underline] in the
vapour of the Potassium & there
were sparks [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] as from
iron in oxygene. there was
a striking distance of a
an inch through the vapour
& the Potassium [unclear]inflamed[/unclear] of
a [underline]blue colour[/underline] - the light
was white occasionally blueish
the edges - there [unclear]came out[/unclear]
first an expansion; but afterwards 
no increase of volume ie no further
increase
