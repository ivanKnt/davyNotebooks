Decomposition of Ammonia
[underline]by Potassium[/underline]
Same day
Same Ammonia analysed ie contained 1/40
of Nitrogene. -
9 measures became what
- Every time the contact was
made with the Potassium -
a black [underline]fume arose[/underline] , [underline]the[/underline]
[underline]Potassium swelled[/underline] & rose to the
top of the [deletion][underline]jar[/underline][/deletion].. - Platina cup -
- [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Red sparks were perceived
but [underline]there was no striking distance[/underline]
& no flame could be produced
as during the action of Potassium
by [underline]Nitrogene[/underline]. -
[marginal note]7 1/2 with 5 1/2[/marginal note]
- When the power was raised
[marginal note]diminish[/marginal note]
an enormous quantity of black fumes -
[marginal note]to 4[/marginal note]
& a striking distance through them. -
[marginal note]14[/marginal note] - All the [underline]Potassium lost[/underline]
[marginal note]10.[/marginal note] no smell of Ammonia when water
[marginal note]3.3.[/marginal note] was added to [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
[marginal note]8 5[/marginal note] The platina was covered with a black substance
which acting upon water gave off Hydrogene -
[marginal note][underline]6.6[/underline][/marginal note] 8 1/2 of the gas with 4 1/2 of oxygene diminished to 4
[marginal note]1.9[/marginal note] 1 more of oxygene diminished to 4, 1 more of oxy - 
no diminution -
[marginal note]Hydrogene to[/marginal note]
[marginal note]Nitrogene nearly[/marginal note]
again 6 of the gas & 5 1/4 of oxygene diminished
[marginal note]is 1 to 4.[/marginal note]
to 4 1/2
9 of Ammonia became 14
