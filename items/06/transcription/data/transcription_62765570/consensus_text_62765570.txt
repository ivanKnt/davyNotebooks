July 5[superscript]th[/superscript] Thermometer 63
[underline]1809[/underline] Barometer - 29.7
Action of [underline]Potassium upon Ammonia[/underline] . -
Measures of [underline]Ammonia[/underline] . - by [underline]Voltaic Elect[superscript]y[/superscript][/underline].
- In this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] the battery was in
far higher action - there was
a great expansion & nearly the
same phaenomena of striking
distance as in the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
of Nitrogene - the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] concluded
after about 3 minutes of very
vivid heat. - 
The contraction on cooling
seemed greater than in any
former instance -
7 of the gas & 4 of oxygene reduced to 4
by detonation take 4.6 from 7 remains 2.4
[marginal note]9[/marginal note]
probably gas not pure certainly not nearly
doubled . in volume
7 into 3
[marginal note]7 into 3[/marginal note] 6 of oxygene & 9 of gas gave a residuum
[marginal note]hasty[/marginal note] of 5 3/4. - 
[marginal note]3 / [deletion]3[/deletion] 2.3[/marginal note]
- The gas given off from the
[marginal note]4.6[/marginal note] Potassium which had been acted on
by [underline]Ammonia[/underline]. 7 & 4 . Gave 2 measures
which with 5 of oxygene leave leave [deletion]5[/deletion] 6
It is pure Hydrogene. This
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] made with the view of ascertaining
whether the basis of [underline]Nitrogene[/underline]. -
was combined [deletion]with[/deletion] in the [underline]amalgam.[/underline]
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] I do not consider
as at all a [underline]good one[/underline] . -
