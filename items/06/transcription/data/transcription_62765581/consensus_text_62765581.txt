Nitrogene carefully made by heating Potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. in
Atmospheric air - appeared to contain no
hydrogene nor oxygene, as it did not detonate
with oxygene - nor was there any absorption by
nitrous Gas. -
( Mercury boiled twice; Evening, & Morning, & was quite
[marginal note][deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/marginal note] cold before the exp.[superscript]ts[/superscript] were made -/
[marginal note][deletion][unclear]Thermo-xx[/unclear] - [/deletion][/marginal note] A quantity of the above nitrogene = Measures
was introduced to a glass tube. the quantity
[marginal note]1. Exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/marginal note] was accurately marked. It was then electrised
by Potassm. carefully freed from Naptha. The effects
[marginal note]Bar[superscript]r[/superscript]: 30.2[/marginal note] by Potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. carefully freed from Naphtha. The effects
[marginal note]Ther. 69.[/marginal note] were similar to those produced in the former
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. - When the potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. was entirely
sublimed. The tube was suffered to cool
& the [deletion]expansion[/deletion] increase of the volume of gas
marked . -
Note. In these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. all the tubes were known to
be quite air tight as they were filled with
mercury & suffered to remain a day over it.-

copious than in the 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. ( owing perhaps
to the formation of potash ) When the potass.

the expansion was noted. it was very
little (owing perhaps to the oxygene of the gas
having combined with potassm.- & reproduced
potash. -)
The Battery in both these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. was in
capital action . - & the circumstances
appeared to be extremely favourable
