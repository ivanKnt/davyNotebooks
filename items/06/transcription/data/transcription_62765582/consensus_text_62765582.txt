[marginal note]1 Exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/marginal note] Ammoniacal gas carefully made over
heated mercury - & containing not more ( I
[marginal note]Barom[superscript]~[/superscript]. 30.1[/marginal note] should think) than 1/100 Nit[superscript]e[/superscript]. - was dried by exposure
[marginal note]Therm[superscript]~[/superscript]. 66.[/marginal note] to ignited potash for one day.-
After the mercury had been boiled & suffered
to cool - A quantity of this gas = [space left for figure] measures
was introduced to a clean, & perfectly dry tube
& acted on by potass[superscript]m[/superscript].. freed from Naptha
for some time. - After some time the tube had become
cold the increase of volume appeared to
more than 1/3 of the original quantity.

[marginal note]2[superscript]nd[/superscript] [underline]Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]., Nitrogene[/underline][/marginal note] Some of the same Nitrogene as was used in
[marginal note]Barom. 30[/marginal note] the 1[superscript]st[/superscript] Exp[superscript]t[/superscript].. Electrized under similar
[marginal note]Therm. 70.5[/marginal note] favourable circumstances. It was observed
however in this case that the fumes evolved
from the potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. were denser. & the tube
blackened much sooner than in the 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. -
the expansion also appeared to be more
considerable. -
