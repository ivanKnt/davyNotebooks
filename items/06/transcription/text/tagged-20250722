of its combination with a minute quantity of iron which lessens
the attraction of cohesion between its particles & disposes them
thus to arrange themselves. Or perhaps it is merely for want
of a sufficient heat in the receiver that the particles of Sodium
do not form a solid mass.- But supposing the receiver was kept
at the fusing point of Sodium Might there not be some danger of its

[nonenglish]nonenglish_009|quere[/nonenglish] ? [deletion]That[/deletion] As Sodium has never been procured in
quantity - but always in minute particles forming a thin
film round the barrel - May not this be a consequence
of its combination with a minute quantity of iron which lessens
the attraction of cohesion between its particles & disposes them
thus to arrange themselves. Or perhaps it is merely for want
of a sufficient heat in the receiver that the particles of Sodium
do not form a solid mass.- But supposing the receiver was kept
at the fusing point of Sodium Might there not be some danger of its
inflammation ?
