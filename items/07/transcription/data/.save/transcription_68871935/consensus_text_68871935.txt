These two Volumes contain the ex-
perimental notes made in the Laboratory of the
Royal Institution from October 1805 to October 1812.
during which time Sir H. Davy was Professor of
Chemistry - After I knew Sir H. Davy he occasionally
tore away leaves upon which notes had been written
that he might carry the data home for consideration
but I presume that during the time he resided in
the House of the Institution there would be no induc- 
ment to do so and that these two volumes have been
but little injured in that way - For their future
security I have this day paged the leaves regularly.
There are 691 pages in this volume and 265 in the
other not one of which is wanting.
