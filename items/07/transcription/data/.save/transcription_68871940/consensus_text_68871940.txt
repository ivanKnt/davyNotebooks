tube with the penumatic apparatus -
When the middle of the tube in which the charcoal
lay was red hot, the red cloth which protected the
end from heat was taken off & the sulphur allowed
to flow gradually over, not stopping till the charcoal
ceased to emit gas, as soon as white fumes appeared
in the intermediate receiver, a jar caught the gas
that came over, which notwithstanding the receiver
was kept as cool as possible by water, were cloudy
in a slight degree - The white fumes passed from the
tube into the receiver like a stream of water, falling
