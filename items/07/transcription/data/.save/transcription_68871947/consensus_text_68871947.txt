An exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. made to procure the gas evolved during the
[unclear]xx[/unclear] [underline]production of the carburet of Sulphur-[/underline]
A glass tube closed at one end , was charged as in
the former exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. with charcoal & sulphur , that had been
 then used. The part to be exposed to the fire was well
heated, & the projecting part bent into the pneumatic
apparatus - The Gas was not received till it [deletion]had[/deletion] became
cloudy - The water commenced immediately to assume
a black dye - After a considerable quantity of gas
was evolved & still continuing to pass over , the
tube seperated into two parts in the middle from
the intensity of heat - None of the carburet had yet
appeared - The tube being broken nothing peculiar
occured , excepting in that part [insertion]in[/insertion] which the sulphur
log mixed with a little charcoal , this part had not been
heated even to redness yet , it gave off a strong smell
peculiar to the carburet of Sulphur . the charcoal was

carburet , & sulphur , which was fluid when examined - taken from
the tube taken into the air, [deletion]&[/deletion] the grains of coal on cooling became
strongly agglutionated , still possessing great lustre -
From this exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] it is very probable, that only a low temperature
below that of a red heat , is requisite for the production of
the carburet of Sulphur -
