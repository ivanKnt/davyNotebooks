Exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] on the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] products of ammonia decomposed
by Potassium -
[Horizontal rule]
12 4/10 of ammonia were acted on in the usual
way by 6 grs of Potassium, when the Potassium
was entirely converted into the olive brown substance
& the retort cold, the absorption amounted to
3.6 cubical inches, & of the whole quantity
remaining 8.83 only 2 cubical inches were absorbed
by agitation with water -
The retort [insertion]was[/insertion] filled with oxygene, & 1 4/5 of
this was transferred into a jar to ascertain
whether it was mixed in the retort with any
common air.
[deletion]Heat being applied to [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Heat applied below
the tray, a brilliant combustion was produced
the olive brown substance burning in the
same beautiful manner as Potassium in oxygene
The [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] gas, [insertion]absorbed[/insertion] the retort being cold
was 3. 6 cubical inches, only 1/100 of the remaining
gas was absorbable by water. The olive brown
substance was entirely converted into
Potash
Analysis of the Gasses
The Nitrous gas was found by means of a soluti
of Sulphat of Iron to contain about 1/30 of Nitrogene
4/10 of a cubical inch of oxygene diminished with 12/10
of this Nitrous gas to rather more than 4/10 -
4/10 of a cubical inch, from 1 4/5 taken from the oxygene
with which the retort was filled diminished with
12/10 of NItrous gas a little more than the last -
4/10 of the gas remaining after the combustion of the
olive brown substance diminished with 12/10 of
