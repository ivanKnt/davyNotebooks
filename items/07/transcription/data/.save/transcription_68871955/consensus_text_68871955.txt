Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] 27.-
Tried a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on [underline]Tellurium[/underline] -
- It revived lead from Zinc & Tellurium
in solutions - It combined with
Potassium producing a most intense [unclear]fire[/unclear]
heat & formed a Metallic alloy which
hissed with water. but gave no [underline]Hydrogene[/underline]
& produced the purple tincture which
became revived tellurium by exposure to
air. - -
When tellurium was brought in
contact with Potash. there seemed
to be formed the [underline]Hydruret of Tellurium[/underline]
& a compound of Tellurium & Potassium
which of course give no Hydrogene by
the action of [underline]Water[/underline].-
