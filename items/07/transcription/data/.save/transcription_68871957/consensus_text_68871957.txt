100 grs of the oxide were made into a paste
with oil, & brought with charcoal powder to a

broken when cold, no globule of Tellurium was
found in the bottom, but small thin scales were

which was intended as flux to unite the

The crucible when cold was broken, a black
substance presented itself, of metallic brilliancy,
it stained the hands, similar to the hydrat of
Tellurium, of a purple colour quickly passing into
brown, it proved soluble in water, which it tinged
of a beautiful [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] purple, but it soon lost this

& became brown - This solution revived several
