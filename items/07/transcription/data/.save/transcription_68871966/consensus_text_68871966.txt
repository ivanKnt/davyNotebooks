.... In vacuo the Thermometer rose
25 degrees in a [underline]minute[/underline] The [deletion]wire[/deletion] coil
of Platina wire was during the exp[superscript]t.[/superscript] at a uniform
cherry-red heat
In common air in the same time the Thermometer
only rose 8 degrees & the platina was only heated
to a dull-red heat.
In carbonic acid gas the effects were much the
same as in common air.
A thicker piece of wire being substituted [deletion]for[/deletion] for
the first, did not appear at all heated in common
air, the thermometer [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] just perceptibly rose,
an exhaustion being made, the wire was dully
ignited. & the Thermometer rapidly expanded in
comparison. . -
With air. It rose less than 2[superscript][unclear]x[/unclear][/superscript]
in Vacuo rather more than six
- Again - wire not visibly
red in air became dull red
in vacuo; & raised the Thermometer
3 degrees in a minute in one instance
& 9 in the other - - The general
ratio is one to 3. -
