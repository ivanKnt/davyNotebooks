[underline]Experiments to ascertain whether the gases
evolved from the compounds of Potassium & the
volatile metals contain any of these metals
in solution.[/underline] -
1. Potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. & Zinc filings were heated by a spirit
lamp in a glass tube. No inflammation took
place, but the tube became very black.
When the compound was introduced to water
inflammation occurred, owing probably to the
presence of some uncombined potassium.
The gas was slowly evolved from the compound
& when a sufficient quantity was collected
it was examined by pure oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]. acid gas,
white fumes were observed but no brown
deposition, as was noticed in the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. when
a copper barrel was used. -
2. The above exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was again repeated &
similar results were observed. -
3. Potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. & Zinc filings were [deletion]heated[/deletion] [insertion]exposed[/insertion] to a
pretty strong red heat in an iron barrel. - The
barrel was cooled under water. - The gas
generated produced copious white fumes in the
receiver. but when tried with oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]. gas no
brown film appeared, only some white fumes were
observed & a diminution of the gas as the oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]
gas mixed with it. -
4. M[superscript]r[/superscript]. D. conceived that the quantity of common
air remain.[superscript]g[/superscript] in the barrel (in last exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] 3.) at the time the
gas was collected, might have prevented the brown
