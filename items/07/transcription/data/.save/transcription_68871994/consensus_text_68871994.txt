deposition [deletion][unclear]xx xxxxxxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] the 3[superscript]rd[/superscript] Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was
repeated in a brass tube & cooled over
mercury. The tube was then filled with
mercury to [deletion][unclear]prevent[/unclear][/deletion] avoid the presence of com[superscript]n[/superscript]
air. & the gas generated over water. -
but neither in this case was there any
brown deposition by oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript] gas - but only
as in the last instance white fumes & a
diminution. -
5. M[superscript]r[/superscript].. D - then conjectured that as Borax
[deletion]was[/deletion] had been used in soldering the copper tube, [deletion]which[/deletion]
that the brown deposition might [deletion]be[/deletion] [insertion]have been[/insertion] occasioned
by the decomposition of the boracic acid by
potass[superscript]m[/superscript].. - - To ascertain whether this idea
was correct - Potass[superscript]m[/superscript].. - Zinc filings & dry
boracic acid in powder were heated to a dull red. -
- unfortunately the tube gave . - but it was
instantly plunged under mercury - & when cold
the little flow was cemented. The tube filled
with mercury, & transferred to the water apparatus
- the gas generated appeared to deposite a slight
brown film. - The gas was removed into a clean
tube & tried with some pure oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]. gas - The
instant the gases came in contact a copious
brown film was perceived, & as well, a film
of a perfectly metallic appearance - somewhat
resembling gold leaf.
6. Potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. & powd..[superscript]d[/superscript] boracic acid were heated together
in a glass tube. - The gas generated did not
produce the brown deposition by oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]., gas
Perhaps this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. not sufficient heat. - the
glass tube was heated to redness. -
