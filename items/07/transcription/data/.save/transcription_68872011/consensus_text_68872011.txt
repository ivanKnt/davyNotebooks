An exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] to ascertain whether sulphat of Barytes
is decomposable by Pure Potash -
A small quantity of Native Sulphat of Barytes
reduced to the finest powder was placed in a
glass tube with more than its weight of Potash
& sufficient distilled water to dissolve the
alkali was added. & the air being rarefied
by boiling for a short time the solution, the
open end of the tube was hermetically sealed.
It was placed on the sand bath & digested
at a temperature below it's boiling point for
a week -
The purity of the Potash used was ascertained
by dissolving a small fragment of the piece, in
pure water & adding Acetat of Barytes. - No
turbidness was produced -
After the digestion [deletion]the tube was opene[/deletion]
the top of the tube was cut off, the liquor
filtered & neutralized by Nitric acid (which
was first found to contain no Sulphuric acid
Acetat of Potash [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] added gave no indication
of any of the Sulphat being decomposed - A very
slight cloudiness was produced, such as might
be expected to have been extracted from the
filtering paper by the Potash -
2.[superscript]d[/superscript] exp.[superscript]t[/superscript]
In this exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] the tube was not hermetically
sealed, [deletion]it was[/deletion] excepting this, the exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was
conducted precisely as the last & was in hand the
same time - The decanted alkaline liquor
when neutralized by the pure Nitric acid
gave on the addition of acetat of Barytes a
pretty copious white precipitate of Sulphat of
Barytes [Horizontal rule]
