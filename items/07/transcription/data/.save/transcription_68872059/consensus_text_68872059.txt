A glass tube half full of distilled Water was
suspended at one extremity of the beam, & weights
to its amount & to that of the water in the scale
at the other end. The height of the water was
marked with a file on the tube, two fragments
of the mineral were introduced, & the expansion
this produced marked on the glass, 8 grains
were required to restore the equilibrium -
The tube was emptied & filled to the last
mark with the same kind of Water first
used, it then required about 2.5 grs to
restore the equilibrium -
The specific gravity of the mineral is 8 - 2.5
= 5.5

The first & last independent of their coincidence
are most & worthy independent of confidence -
The mineral cut glass with ease, it's hardness
about that of carnelian, for it made on that stone
a slight mark -

slight admixture of gray -
