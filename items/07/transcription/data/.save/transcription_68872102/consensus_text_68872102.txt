4 grs of Potass,,[superscript]m[/superscript] were heated [insertion]to redness[/insertion] with
some Silex - There was no hydrogene
generated. - The matter partially
inflamed when in contact with air. -
it [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] exhibited a [insertion]faint[/insertion] metallic appearance
& with water, evolved gas. -
- - When muriatic acid was added to the
water containing some of the matter, it occasioned
a singular noise. [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] somewhat resembling the
decrepetation of salts. or the explosion of
Phosphuret.[superscript]d[/superscript] hydro.[superscript]e[/superscript] gas. -
The experiment of Potass.[superscript]m[/superscript] & Silex
was repeated with nearly similar results.

- - - The combination of imperfect metals
such as lead & Bismuth with mercury & Potass
& even the amalgam of the perfect metals
as Silver & Gold [insertion]with Potass.[superscript]m[/superscript][/insertion] seem rather to diminish
than to increase the metallization of
Ammonia; [deletion]on the [unclear]xxxxxx xx xxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
or the formation of Ammonium. -
An amalgam of sodium & mercury
appears also to be less efficacious in
forming Ammonium. - than a similar
amalgam of Potass.[superscript]m[/superscript] & mercury. -
