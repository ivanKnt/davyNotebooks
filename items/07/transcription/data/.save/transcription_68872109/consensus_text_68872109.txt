[unclear]8[/unclear] inches of Fluoric acid gas were

absorbed by Water - the silex precipitated

bath 2 grs -
9 cubic inches of Fluoric acid gas were
absorbed by Water - The silex thrown [insertion]down[/insertion] was
washed with Muriatic acid & afterwards
by distilled Water - Heated to redness in
a Platina crucible it weighed 1 4/10 of
a grain - In the first exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. a little mercury
probably in a finely divided state was the
cause of the greater weight of the precipitate
The filtered liquid was evaporated to dryness, the residue
was digested in dilute [unclear]muriatic[/unclear] acid - The acid solution
was decanted & evaporated to dryness, slight traces of saline matter
alone remained - the residue insoluble in muriatic acid, was heated
to redness it weighed 1 1/2 gr its colour was reddish white -.
1. [underline]Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. to ascertain whether Ammonia[/underline]
[underline]can be formed without the contact of air.[/underline]
About 2 parts of powdered Charcoal
& 1 of dried Pearlash were mixed
together & heated intensely in an iron
tube. The whole of the apparatus
was air tight. - When a considerable
quantity of gas had escaped - the water
connected at one end was boiled in order
to expel the common air yet remaining
in this tube; When this last was effected
the whole of the gas in the receiver was
drawn out by means of a curved glass tube. -
The process was then continued for about
1/2 hour & while [deletion]it was[/deletion] the barrel was
cooling some vapour of water was passed
through it It was found after
some time that the apparatus [unclear]was[/unclear] not tight
