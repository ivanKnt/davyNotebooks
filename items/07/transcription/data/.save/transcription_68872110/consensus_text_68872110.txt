20 grs of metallic arsenic was converted into arsenic
acid, by three distillations to dryness with nitro muriatic
acid - The evaporating dish containing the arsenic acid
weighed 1022 grains - Washed out & dried the
evaporating dish weighed 34 grs less - The liquid
was replaced & again evaporated to dryness, the
whole weighed 1018 grs - 1018 8/10 after an
other distillation of the acid - after two distillations
more 10[deletion]2[/deletion]19 grs -
The gas generated by the action of Water on the
amalgam of ammonium consisted of 10.5 measures
of ammonia & . 6.5 of Hydrogene
The gas from the amalgam of ammonium carbonat
of ammonia being used in procuring it consisted
of 5 of ammonia & 3 1/2 of Hydrogene -
Carbonat of ammonia again used, the gas
generated without the aid of heat contained 5 2/3 of
ammonia & 4 of hydrogene
Carb.[superscript]t[/superscript] of ammonia again used, the gas given off
without the aid of heat consisted of 5 1/3 of ammonia
& 4 of hydrogene
Gas from an amalgam of ammonium made
by [deletion]Pota[/deletion] an amalgam of Potassium consisted of
5 of ammonia & .3 of Hydrogene
