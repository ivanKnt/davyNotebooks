About 4 parts of Coarsely powdered
Charcoal & 1 of dried Kali were mixed
together & heated in an iron barrel [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of[/deletion]

When the barrel was partially red
some [deletion]wate[/deletion] [insertion]aqueous[/insertion] vapour was passed through it
in order to expel the whole of the
common air. - A quantity of gas
which had been collected was now
entirely drawn from the receiver - & after
the whole had been exposed to a strong
heat for about half an hour some
vapour of water was passed through the
barrel. Copious dense white fumes [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
now appeared which were much more
abundant than had previously occurred.-
And an immense quantity of gas was procured.-
After some time those fumes ceased to
appear ; but as the water [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] continued -
boiling & passing through the barrel, the gas
was copiously evolved.- 7 different portions
of gas were obtained for examination - After
which the fire was slackened &in [deletion]xxx &in[unclear]xxx xx[/unclear] the
gas ceased to come over - the fire was
gradually raised & the water still being in
a state of ebullition 7 other distinct portions
of gas were procured. The process of cooling
& heating was again repeated - but by this
time the water was all boiled away. &- as
