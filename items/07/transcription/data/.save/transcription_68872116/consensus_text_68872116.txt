6 grs of Potassium in 17 1/2 cubic inches of
Silicated fluoric acid gas
[Horizontal rule]
Decem.[superscript]r[/superscript] 23
11 1/2 cubic inches of [deletion]silicated[/deletion] fluoric acid
gas prepared in the usual way in
glass vessels were absorbed by diluted
muriatic acid - The gas had remained several
days in the receiver before used -
The silex precipitated was well washed
dried & heated nearly to whiteness it
weighed 7/10 of a grain -
The solution in which the silex was
precipitated, was evaporated to dry dryness -
The residue was of a reddish white colour
ignited in a platina crucible it gave off
much fumes, the residue was still of a
reddish white colour - It weighed 4 grains -
It had a slight saline taste - It was
boiled for a short time in distilled water
the water was almost tasteless, a saline taste
was scarcely perceptible - Evaporated to
dryness a very small quantity of salt was
left - its taste was saccharine, something like
that of alum but not an astringent - filtered
it gave a copious precipitate with nitrat of
Silver -
