[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] by rubbing it with a little sand 1 grain
less than before - Neither muriatic acid or
a solution of Potash seemed to dissolve it -
Probably in separating it a little platina might
be taken from the crucible by the friction -
[Horizontal rule]
10 cubic inches of Fluoric acid gas absorbed -
The silex [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] left in the dilute muriatic solution
was evaporated to dryness, & heated in a
platina crucible at a dull red heat, till it
ceased to emit any fumes. Its colour was then
white with the slightest admixture of red - It
weighed both in & out of [insertion]the[/insertion] crucible exactly 3 grains -
Placed again in the crucible it required a strong
cherry-red heat to drive off all the fumes - Its
colour was much the same as before it
now weighed only 2 4/10 grains -
-
About 4 parts of well burnt charcoal in coarse
powder were mixed with 1 part of Pearlash
(heated to redness), & introduced into a Gun barrel
& strongly heated. - the barrel was furnished at one end
with a copper tube containing pure water that
had been boiled, to free it from air. And at the other
end with a small glass receiver, & a long tube
inverted in mercury to prevent the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]access[/insertion] of
the external air. - During the process a great
quantity of [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] inflammable gas was evolved
& there was a strong smell of sulphuretted
hydrogene.- The gas at different intervals
burnt like hydrogene, Carb[superscript]d[/superscript]. hydro[superscript]e[/superscript]. & [unclear]x[/unclear] sulph[superscript]d[/superscript]. hydro[superscript]e[/superscript].
