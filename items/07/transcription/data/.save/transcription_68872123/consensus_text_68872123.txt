About 4 parts of well burnt charcoal in
Coarse powder [insertion]& 1 part of pure dry potash[/insertion] were strongly heated in an iron
apparatus as above. - When the gas ceased to
come over. the barrel was cooled & the fire
removed - a little water [insertion]which had been [unclear]previously[/unclear] boiled[/insertion] was then suffered to
flow on the mixture from the copper barrel
& a gentle heat was applied to drive it in the
receiver. After some time a little fluid collected
into the receiver. When examined it [deletion][unclear]was found[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] smelled strongly of ammonia. - It must
have been a pretty strong solution. It had a bluish
colour probably from the copper tube. - . - The barrel
was again [deletion]heated[/deletion] [insertion]raised[/insertion] to a strong red heat. Inflammable gas
as [unclear]before[/unclear] was copiously evolved. - The barrel was again
cooled & more water passed through it. - In this case
the fluid that collected was of a dark colour; [deletion]&[/deletion] though
the ammoniacal odour was perceptible it was not so distinct
as in the [deletion]other exp[superscript]t[/superscript]..[/deletion] first trial [insertion]There appeared to be too much water formed[/insertion] - There [deletion]appeared[/deletion] [insertion]seemed[/insertion] to be but
little potash in this solution & less in the other case. -
-. The process of heating, cooling & passing water through
was again repeated, & some of the fluid collected in the
receiver very much resembled that obtained in the first
case - in colour, & smell. - By raising the heat more
fluid was obtained. it was very similar to the last mentioned,
- By containing the process abundance of inflammable
gas was evolved. - & more fluid was obtained. - having a
pretty strong ammoniacal smell. - - [unclear]When[/unclear] the dark
coloured fluid was [unclear]attained[/unclear] the gas generated appeared to
carry over with it potass.[superscript]m[/superscript] in solution. It very much
resembled [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] hydrogene in potass,[superscript]m[/superscript]-. -. there was a
quantity of white fumes produced. -
