1 2/10 of Potassium, were heated in
a green glass tube in hydrogen with
phosphorus which before the Potassium
had been admitted was fused in the
tube - The combination took place with
the production of much heat & red
light, the bent part of the tube
was covered with a brownish black
sublimate - There was a small increase
of gas - The tube was filled with mercury
& strong muriatic acid gas being added
produced 1 & nearly 1/10 of a cubic inch
of gas that did not inflame on
being thrown into the atmosphere -
It was remarkable that the acid
did not commence to act, till
it had been agitated in the tube
for nearly a minute. -
Febuary 23 -
10 grs of Sulphur were employed to coat
the interior of the green glass retort -
10 grs more of sulphur were added &
fused in the bulb of the retort - The tube
was partly filled with dried hydrogen -
6/10 of a grain of Potassium was made to act
on the sulphur, some time elapsed before the
fused sulphur combined, when the combination
took place, there appeared no inflammation
as usual, it was only sensible by the
formation & sublimation of a brownish black
matter - The increase of gas was exceedingly
small. The tube being filled with Mercury
a portion of muriatic acid saturated
