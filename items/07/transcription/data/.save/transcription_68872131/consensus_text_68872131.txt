saturated with sulphuretted Hydrogen was
added, the disingagement of gas was in -
stantaneous, & a flash of light appeared to
be emitted, the volume of gas produced
amounted to about .65 of a cubic inch, it
was not absorbed by cold water & it
burnt like hydrogen -
1 grain of sulphur was placed in the bulb
of the retort without a coating of sulphur, &
melted in hydrogen 4/10 of a grain of Potassium
was added, the combination took place without
any sensible emission of light, The gas in
this case instead of being increased, suffered
a very small diminution - The colour of the
sulphuret formed appeared from the super-
ficial part in contact with the glass
of a dark purplish red-Acted on by Muri-
atic acid saturated with Sulp[superscript]d[/superscript]. Hydrogene
it very slowly gave off gas, in about 1/4 of
an hour when it had ceased, the volume
of gas amounted to .45 of a cubic inch
which was entirely absorbed by Water -
10 grs of Sulphur & 1 2/10 of Potassium
combined with such energy, that the
heat produced broke the tube -
10 grs of Sulphur & 1 4/10 of Potassium
combined together with the usual phenomena
of heat & light. & without in the least
injuring the tube. this was owing to the
sulphur having being kept some time in
fusion & the glass being by that means
