95/100 of Potassium & 19 grs of Phosph[unclear]xx[/unclear]
they combined together so energetically
that the heat evolved broke the
retort, the phosphorus being con-
sumed, it was intended to ascertain
how much gas [insertion]the phosphuret[/insertion][deletion]it[/deletion] would afford
by the action of Muriatic acid.
but the bulb of the retort being
broken off, the phosphuret of Potassium
took fire & burnt into phosphuret
of Potash, that gave off Phosphuretted
hydrogen by the action of warm
water -.
1 grain of Phosphorus & 9/10 of a grain
of Potassium combined together in a
green glass retort in hydrogen with
a vivid appearance & light & heat.
Note The Phosphorus before the Potassium
was admitted had been fused in
the vessel -
The phosphuret formed had the usual
appearance - The volume of gas
was increased from 95/100 of a cubic
inch to 1 cubic inch - It contained
Phosphorus in solution but it was
not inflammable -
The tube being filled with Mercury
the Phosphuret afforded by the
action of strong Muriatic acid
9/10 of a cubic inch of gas, which
had a phosphureous smell, but did
not inflame when passed into
the air - - - - - - -
