the gas did not inflame, but it possessed
a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, &
became cloudy, as if phosphorus was sus-
pended in it -
The retort was filled with mercury,
the phosphuret a small quantity of
Muriatic acid being added was
immediately decomposed, 8/10 of a cubic
inch of gas was evolved, which though it
not inflame in coming in contact with the
air, yet had the same appearance & smell
as the gas, that comes over just before
the pure phosphuretted Hydrogen in making
that gas, it was cloudy, & strongly im
pregnated with a phosphureous smell -
1 3/10 gr of Potassium was heated in
about a cubic inch of Phosphuretted
Hydrogen - The phosphuret was formed
as in the preceeding operation, when
the retort which was of green glass
was cold, a considerable absorption
of gas appeared to have taken place,
by gently heating again the bulb of
the retort where the metal was,
the absorption continued, the mercury
rose sensibly in the tube, & was
continuing to rise, when the heat
was withdrawn, on breaking the
bulb of the retort, it's gaseous contents
burst into a bright red flame -
