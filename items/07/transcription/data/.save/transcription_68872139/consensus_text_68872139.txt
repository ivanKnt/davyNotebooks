9/10 of Potassium were heated in 1/45 c I. of
Hydrogen that had been dried by Mur. [superscript]t[/sueprscript] of
Lime, the heat applied was low, never so
high as a dull red, it was continued for about
1/2 hour, the interior of the bulb of the retort
which was of green glass gradually blackened
& became at last so dark as to be opaque
a little grey powder, sublimed, from it's
appearance it was not easy to determine
whether it was merely Potassium in a fine
state of division, or the metal with [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]substantial[/deletion] portion of Hydrogen. The quantity
of Hydrogen absorbed was no more
than 16/100 of a cubic inch - After the absor-
ption had reached so far, the retort was
again heated, but further diminution
was produced -
The tube was removed to the water
apparatus, by the action of Water, the
Potassium afforded .75 of a cubic inch
of gas, which inflamed & burnt with
a beautiful green light, similar
in colour to spirits of wine containing

to the flame of spirits of wine tinged
by muriat of copper -
