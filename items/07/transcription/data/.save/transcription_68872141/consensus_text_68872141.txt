1 4/10 of Potassium - The retort employed
was of white glass & was lined with Sulphur.
Sulphuretted Hydrogen was admitted instead
of pure Hydrogen; it had been dried by
mur[superscript][unclear]x[/unclear][/superscript]. of Lime, an absorption immediately
appeared to take place, a spirit lamp
was applied to the sulphur & the
sulphuret was formed as usual &
without injuring the tube - When cold
there was diminution instead of
increase of gas, the original quantity
was 1 & 1/10 of a cubic inch, the remainder
was 93/10 the absorption therefore was about
1[deletion]3[/deletion]6/100 --
The sulphuret by the action of
15/100 of a cubic inch of Muriatic acid
nearly satur ated with sulphuretted
Hydrogen, afforded 1.7 cu. I. of
gas, of which 25/100 of a cubic was
not absorbed by water. it was inflam
mable burning silently like pure hydrogen
containing a little sulphur in solution -
1 grain & 1/2 of Potassium was placed in
a white glass retort containing 2.3 cubic
inches of [deletion]Phosphuretted[/deletion] [insertion]Sulphuretted[/insertion] Hydrogen -
on the addition of the Potassium the
gas immediately began to rise in
the tube., before it had ceased the
Potassium was heated a vivid
inflammation took place, just the
same as appears when Potassium
is directly combined with Sulphur
