when the retort was cold, the gas
was diminished 5/10 of a cubic Inch -
The retort was filled with mercury
By the action of 45/100 of a cubic Inch
of muriatic acid nearly saturated
with Sulphuretted Hydrogen, on the
sulphuret 2.2. cubic inches of gas
were produced which excepting 4/10
of a cubic inch were absorbed by
water, the residue burnt like
Hydrogen retaining a small portion
of Sulphur.
Barom. 30
Ther. 62
The sulphuretted Hydrogen employed
contained not 1/30 of Hydrogen -
55/100 of a cubic inch were added to
3/10 of a cubic inch of the muriatic
acid employed in the three preceding
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. to ascertain it's state of saturation.
by agitation 15/100 about that were
absorbed, the remainder disappeared
when agitated with Water -
