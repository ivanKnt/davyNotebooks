1 grain of Iron wire was heated to
redness in 1.4 cubic inch of Sulphuretted
Hydrogen, by means of Voltaic electricity from
40 double plates. The Iron soon fused after
it became red hot, & the [deletion][unclear]connec[/unclear][/deletion] connection
of the two ends of the battery [deletion]being[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] broken at
The fused iron by the action of dilute
muriatic acid gave off about 1 1/3 cubic
inch of Hydrogen -
The volume gas in which the Iron
was heated amounted to 1.4 cu I.
of which .7 only were unabsorbed by
water -
1.5 c I. of the original gas was
found to contain . 35 of a cubic inch
of Hydrogene -
