time - No gas was evolved before the
platina tube was heated nearly to redness,
then it suddenly came over very rapidly.
& continued to be produced for a considerable
time - the tube was never heated much
above a bright red heat - it was taken out
of the fire when the gas had ceased to come
over, an absorption of mercury had taken
place in the tube - the tube when opened
gave off a strong smell of ammonia
& filled with water a few bubbles of
gas were produced - Some boracic acid
basis was found in the tube -
Note - during the distillation the tube was
kept cool by Water -
The gas produced by the distillation
amounted to 4 1/2 cubic inches -
Which consisted of 3 1/4 of gas absorbed by
water & of 1 1/4 not absorbed -
10 measures of this additional gas inflamed
with the electric spark, without any oxygene
being added & diminished to about 7 1/2 -
3 of oxygene more then added, the second
diminution was to about 7 3/4
2 [superscript]d[/superscript]. exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] 8 of the gas & 4 of oxygene
diminished to 7 3/4
