1 grain of Potassium was admitted into
a small green glass retort containing a
known quantity of silicated [unclear][deletion]fluor[/deletion] boracic[/unclear] acid.
No absorption of the gas took place [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] before
heat was applied. When the bulb of the retort
was gently heated, a brilliant globule of
Potassium issued out from beneath the surface
of Potash, it remained only for a short time
bright & of it's proper colour, the uppermost
surface that was not in contact with glass
soon became black, gradually acquiring this
colour - The whole of the potassium just as
the first globule was converted burst
into a vivid flame, an absorption of
the gas was produced. The residual
gas transferred contained about 1
cubic inch of gas not absorbed by
water -
This gas did not inflame in Volta's
eudiometer without additional oxygene -
6 measures of the gas & 4 of oxygene
inflamed & diminished to 8 - There
was no inflammation more oxygene
being added -
7 3/4 of the gas & 6 1/4 of oxygene
inflamed & diminished to 11. No
absorption was produced by agitating
the residue with a solution of Potash -
Note. - The substance that remained
in the retort: was of a brownish black colour
acted on by water it produced a little
gas that had some resemblance in smell
to Phosphuretted hydrogene ~
