Examination of the liquors from
Loftus alum works -
N.[superscript]o[/superscript] 1. Filtered of the original yellow colour
& not perfectly transparent - Prussiat
of Potash produces with it, a copious
greenish white precipitate - a few drops
of nitric acid added, occasions the colour
immediately to become dark blue -
Hence it appears that N.[superscript]o[/superscript] 1. contains
green sulphat of Iron. & owes it's yellowish
colour to a little red oxide suspended
which gives the light shade of green
to the white precipitate by prussiat
of Potash - When this liquor is boiled
it follows, that the Iron becomes more
highly oxyginated, part of the oxide therefore
falls down - Ammonia occasions with this
liquor, a copious precipitate of a dirty
white colour - if the precipitate be
redissolved in Nitric acid & ammonia
again added, the colour of the precipitate
is now of a reddish brown colour -
The liquor contains an excess of
acid - it reddens litmus paper -
Nitrat of silver produced a pretty
copious precipitate, but a small part
of this only appeared to be muriat
of silver - it [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/deletion][/unclear] [insertion]acquired[/insertion] when exposed
to light a purple hue -
No smell of ammonia was produced
by adding Potash to a small portion
of the liquor -
