[underline]on the action of Potassium on fused Potash[/underline]
Some pure potash was fused in a silver
crucible till the cessation of effervescence
indicated the dissipation of water foreign
to its composition - Whilst in fusion at
a heat below that of redness. Potassium
filling a small platina cup was
immersed [insertion]in[/insertion] it - immediately a violent
effervescence was produced which gradually
diminished till it had entirely ceased .
the cup on examination using water
was found to contain only Potash -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated several
times with fresh portions of Potassium
in the same cup - the results
differed only in the degree of the
effervescence - as the quantity of Potassium
used increased, the action was apparently
proportionably less - the Potash became
more difficult of fusion - & at the same
time became of a denser colour. till at
last it was nearly black - the colour
seemed to be occasioned by the presence
of [deletion]char[/deletion] carbon derived from the carbonic
acid, absorbed by the potash & decomposed
by the Potassium -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated several
times, using a larger cup & that of
brass, with more Potassium, the same
result [unclear]were[/unclear] obtained -
Sometimes the Potassium immersed
