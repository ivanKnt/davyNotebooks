Several grains of neutral carbonat

cub. in. of oxy muriatic acid gas
entered - this gas contained about
1/50 of common air.-
Where the gas came in contact
with the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] carbonat, water
appeared to be separated - it was
visibly condensed on the glass.-
In less than 5 minutes, 2.2
cub. inches of gas were generated by
the action of the oxy. mur. without

The 5.8 cubic inches of gas
were well agitated with a solution
of Potash, of these 4.7 were absorbed,
