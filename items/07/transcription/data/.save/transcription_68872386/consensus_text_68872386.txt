disappeared, the Phosphorous became
of a darker colour - the sides of the
retort were coveredm with moisture,
The stop cock removed.- fumes in
abundance were emitted similar
to those from the Phosphuretted
liquor in smell & other respects.

on the side of the retort had
fallen on the cement - on this it
had the same effect as Spirit
of wine, converting it into a kind
of paint or varnish, which might be
spread on the hand, but but as the
liquid passed off in fumes the
cement again hardened.-

Sulphuret of Potash in powder previously
heated - to redness were heated
in oxymuriatic acid gas - no
violent action was perceived .- there
was very soon a [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] formation
of the Sulphuretted liquor of [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
in great abundance considering the
quantities - It did not appear
precisely the same as the common
liquor, not so fluid, not so volatile
having a smell approaching the etherial.
The washings of the solid matter
remaining precipitated Nitrat of Silver.-
