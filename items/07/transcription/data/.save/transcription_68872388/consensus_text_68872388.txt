3 grs of brown blende - 2.1 of
oxy + .3 + .5 + .4 + .2 + .4 + .3 + .2 =
2.3 Cubic inches -
Thomsons Sulphuretted liquor was
formed & oxymuriat of Zinc -.
The whole of the blende could not
be converted -
The residual gas in the retort
after the oxymuriatic acid gas had
been absorbed by water was found
to be Nitrogene - it did not
detonate with Hydrogene.-
Sulphur was separated from
the Blende & remained uncombined
with the oxymur. gas.
- 20 grs of Iron pyrites in
fine powder - as soon as the
oxymuriatic gas entered the retort
white fumes appeared, great heat
was produced, & Thompson's liquor
was immediately formed.-
Heat being applied the oxymuriat
of Iron rapidly formed & sublimed
in small plates, like silver spangles-
when settled on the sides of the
retort, they presented a beautiful
appearance, [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] some being as white
& brilliant as Silver,. others
bright reddish brown, some were
the colour .of the Lapis Lazuli &
some green like the peacock's tail
