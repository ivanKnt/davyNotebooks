Repeated the last exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] 2 cubic
inches of Carbonic acid gas were fully
saturated with ammoniacal - the
retort exhausted - 2.5 of muriatic
gas entered - slight fumes were
produced with a little heat - the
retort was made sensibly warm
about 3/4 of a cubic inch was the
extent of the absorption - & part
of this must have been occasioned
[deletion]by[/deletion] during the passage of the gas thro'
the stop-cocks for when the
lower stop-cock only was opened
there was a slight absorption -
The retort was heated till
the principal part of the salt
was sublimed - when cold there
was an absorption of only 1/4 of a
cubic inch -
The gas in the retort was
transferred in mercury, into a
glass, saturated with muriatic [unclear]xx[/unclear] a.
of 70 measures of this, 25 [unclear]were[/unclear] absorbed
almost immediately by water - Therefore
supposed to be muriatic gas - this
gas was present for [unclear]certain[/unclear]. as the
[deletion]fumes[/deletion] mixed gas fumed. -
The remainder was agitated .
with a solution of Potash - 32 were
thus absorbed - Carbonic acid &
13 of Common air remained -
