about 10 grs of fused carbonat of Potash

was an absorption of 1 cub. inch -
Heat was then applied - there was
then an absorption of [deletion]of[/deletion] 7/10 of a cub. inch -
Heated again absorp. = 3/10
only 2/10 more were absorbed - the
exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was stopt - more would probably
have been absorbed, if it was
continued. -
12 [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] measures of the gas in the retort
contained about 1 of Muriatic gas. -
The remaining 11 agitated with a
solution of Potash diminished to 4.-
The capacity of the retort was
about 1 6/10 cub. inch.-
[Horizontal rule]
About 10 grs of fused carbonat
of Soda pulverized whilst warm in
a warm mortar.- 2.9 cubic inches of
muriatic acid gas entered - There was
an immediate action the temperature
was much raised, & water was rapidly
generated, which appeared condensed in
large drops contiguous to the dry salt.-
In a few minutes there was an
absorption of 1.2 cub inches
After about 2 hours the whole absorption
including the last (1.2) amounted
