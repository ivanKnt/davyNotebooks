Decem. 6 -
1 cubic inch of muriatic gas was
added to 1 cubic inch of ammoniacal gas
there was an immediate condensation of
1.83 - there remained of course about [deletion]1.8[/deletion]
.17 of which 07/100 was absorbed by water
& 1/10 remaining inflamed like hydrogene.-
10 measures of the muriatic acid gas
contained 1 of inflammable air.-
The ammoniacal gas was quite pure
1 cubic inch of pure ammoniacal
gas & 1 of carbonic gas containing 1/27 of
common air - diminution to 5/10 of a cubic
inch very nearly .- another cubic inch of
pure ammonia was added - the whole
was absorbed except about 1/27 of a cubic
inch - not quite so much as that rather
1/30.-
1 cubic inch of muriatic acid gas
containing 1/10 of common air was next added
there was an absorption of 4/10 - The
residue of 1/30 had been previously thrown
out of the receiver.-
1 cubic inch more of muriatic gas
