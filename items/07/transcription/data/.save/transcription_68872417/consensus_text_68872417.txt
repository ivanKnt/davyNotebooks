heat.-
The greatest part of the [deletion]carbonat[/deletion]
salt was sublimed gradually by
the spirit lamp.-
The retort was exhausted a second
time - 2.5 cub. in of muriatic gas entered
very slight fumes were perceived, but
no heat.-
as much as possible of the salt
was sublimed again, when the retort
was cold there was an absorption
of 6/10 of a cub in.-
17 measures of the gas in the retort
were immediately diminished by Water
to 5 - by agitation with a solution
of Potash diminution to 1.-
