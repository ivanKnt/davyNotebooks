mur. gas - what remained was very slowly
absorbable - it consisted of a mixture
of the new gas & of Hydrogene & carbonic
oxide. -
6 measures of the gas
6 Ammonia
condensation to 5.5 - Agitated well
the residue to ascertain whether the
ammonia would condense more of
the gas - no further condensation
6 more Ammonia
condensation to 3 -
6 more ammonia
condensation to 1.5; - The residue
was thrown away it still smelt
strongly of the new gas -
Added 12 measures of Muriatic acid gas
in a minute or two there was an
absorption of about 4 measures
sublimed the salt - on cooling it formed
small brilliant crystals - No further
absorption .- the residual muriatic gas
transfered to Water was absorbed as there
remained a little gas which had no offensive
smell & it exceeded in quantity the impurity of
the muriatic gas - probably Carbonic acid -
Added 6 measures of Sulphureous acid gas.
No immediate absorption - sublimed the salt
when cold - no change of Volume. -
Added about 2 measures of liquid
muriatic acid. - the sulphureous gas being
removed - an immediate effervescence. -
