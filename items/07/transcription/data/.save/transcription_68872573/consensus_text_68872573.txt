about 2 measures of Carbonic gas were
produced - or 4 making allowance for
that which the muriatic acid would
absorbe.-
Saturated 8 measures of the gas
with Ammonia - Agitated it with
3 measures of [insertion]liquid[/insertion] muriatic acid - 7
measures of Carbonic acid were
produced - ie a gas which was
absorbable by Water & had no
smell. - -
Heated red oxide of Mercury in the gas
a little white matter formed - exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. stopt
on account of the rapid production of
oxygene - the gas still retained it's
peculiar smell -
Sublimed white oxide of arsenic in it
there was no apparent production of the
butter of Arsenic - the peculiar smell of the
gas remained -
Heated white oxide of Zinc in it
there was a complete decomposition - Horn
Zinc rapidly formed - when cold the
volume unaltered - the gas had no
offensive smell - it was absorbed like
carbonic [deletion]oxide[/deletion] [insertion]acid[/insertion]. -
Heated the protoxide of Antimony
in it. - Butter of antimony was rapidly
formed. - A white pellicle covered the fused
oxide through which the fused oxide burst
& oozed out there was also a white
sublimate similar to this infusible white
pellicle of peroxide. - The gas had lost its smell
it burnt like Carbonic oxide - Ergo the protoxide
has a stronger affinity for oxygene than Carbonic oxide. -
