Nitrogene tempr[superscript]r[/superscript] 1.02
Augt [deletion]5[/deletion]6. - ignited charcoal
by Voltaic electricity - in a mixture
of 10 Nitrogene & [unclear][deletion]2[/deletion][/unclear] boric
as much Chlorine - the light
was very brilliant the charcoal
fell in ignited points no
nitrogene was destroyed
& no carbonic acid or
only an insensible quantity
formed in this experiment
[Horizontal rule]
A mixture of about equal
parts Chlorine & Carbonic oxide
were converted into the New Gas
by exposure to light only not
the bright rays of the Sun for
about 2 hours - the Weather very
dull. - -
The compound of the new gas & ammonia
appears to be a neutral salt not decomposable
by Water - its solution in Water neither changes
the colour of Litmus or Turmeric. -
It is not decomposed by Acetic acid.
but is soluble in it - added a little muriatic
acid to a solution of this kind [insertion]in a glass tube over mercury[/insertion] Carbonic
acid gas in plenty was disengaged. -
The new gas reddens litmus -
A little of it was introduced into a clean
dry tube containing a slip of dry litmus paper &
full of dry mercury - the paper immediately became
red - - - -
