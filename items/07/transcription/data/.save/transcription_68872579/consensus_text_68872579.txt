Saturated 50 measures of muriatic
acid with Ammonia - added 25
measures of the new gas - no apparent
alteration - heated some of the
salt - when cold the gas had not
lost it's smell - but it fumed - &
proof that some of the muriat
was decomposed - & it was
increased to 30 measures. -
Saturated some Sulphureous acid
gas with Ammonia - Sulphat of Ammonia
was formed & a golden liquid Sulphuret
of Ammonia. - Added a little of the
new gas. - the golden colour disappeared
that of common Sulphur supplying it's
place & the compound of the new gas
& Ammonia was formed - [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the
whole of it was not condensed - its
smell remaining [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] without any admixture
of the smell of sulphureous acid. -
Added 60 measures of the new gas
to a saturated solution of Carbonat
of Soda - there was an immediate
decomposition - 70 measures of Carbonic
acid gas were produced - & more
probably as the solution presently
absorbed some of this. - . The gas
had not the least smell. -
Added 42 [deletion]of[/deletion] measures of the gas
to Carbonat of magnesia in Water 64
measures of Carbonic acid were produced
without any of the gas remaining. -
