Spirit of Wine absorbed about
47 measures of the gas. - The smell
of this compound was not quite that
of the gas - not so offensive -
but equally pungent - affecting
more so than the gas itself, the
eyes & nostrils - immediately producing
tears on coming in contact with
the eyes - [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]tho'[/insertion] not inhaled .- It
did not appear to be decomposed
by Water or heat - as after the
addition of Water - the [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] compound
remained adhering to the side of
the tube as its smell indicated. -
its taste [deletion]exp[/deletion] extremely pungent &
different from that of alcohol & not
acid. - a heat that the hand could
not bear was required to convert
it into vapour - which again almost
entirely condensed on cooling. -
