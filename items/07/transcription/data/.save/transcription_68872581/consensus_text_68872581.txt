Exposed a mixture of equal
parts of oxymuriatic gas &
Nitrous oxide for two days

bright at intervals. - No change
of colour. - Mercury admitted
little or no absorption. - the
mercury was soon tarnished as
by common Chlorine - this gas
agitated with Water - the chlorine
absorbed - a taper burnt in the
residue as in Nitrous oxide.
The smell not quite that
of common chlorine. -
About 6 cubic inches Nitrous
