7 measures of oil of Turpentine absorbed
about 7 of the gas. - The smell of
the gas was slightly imparted to
the oil. - it was not pungent
but produced cough when inhaled. -
Equal parts of gas &
olefiant gas were for several days
exposed to Light - no alteration. -
no change of Volume. - the gas
retained it's peculiar smell - [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]olefiant gas[/deletion] & might be separated
from the olefiant by Water - The
olefiant mixed with the gas burnt
with it's usual [deletion]orange[/deletion] [insertion]yellow[/insertion] flame but
with a circumscribed green one
in addition - owing to the new gas -
A cubic inch of muriatic acid
gas was introduced into a tube
containing several grains of recently
burnt Lime - after 24 hours only
1/2 CI. was absorbed. -
A similar exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. made with 1 cubic
inch of Carbonic acid gas over Lime. -
After two days an absorption only of about
1/10 of a cubic I. -
The new gas is decomposed by
Water - After exposure to Light [deletion]the[/deletion] with
Water in a tube the gas that remained
was Carbonic acid gas - & strong Sulphuric
acid expelled from the Water muriatic
acid gas. -
It is decomposed by Water even in
darkness - as the loss of the peculiar
odour & residual carbonic acid gas
indicate. [Horizontal rule]
