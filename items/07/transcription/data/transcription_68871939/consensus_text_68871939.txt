fumes were of a reddish brown [insertion]& white[/insertion] colour. -
In the neck of the retort there were some beautiful
pieces of crystallised arsenic - but they did not contain
any potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. - A little below there was a quantity
of a soft black substance coating the surface. - When
heated dense white fumes exhaled & It almost wholly
burnt away [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] It is conceived to be a compound
of charcoal & arsenic. - A minute quantity of
pyrosphorus was also formed which was observed to inflame
when exposed to the atmosphere
[underline]Examination of the gas from this last exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/underline]
4 of the gas & 5 of oxygene when mixed together
produced white fumes, by passing the spark through
a violent [deletion]diminution[/deletion] inflammation took place.
& the diminution was to 5 3/4, 2 3/4 more of [deletion]oxygen[/deletion][insertion]gas[/insertion]
being added white fumes were again produced, but
did not inflame -
2[superscript]d[/superscript]. exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. 7 measures of the Gas & 7 of oxygene produced
when mixed together white fumes as before, & more
diminished by agitation to 9 1/3, the electric spark
passed through diminished them to 5 1/3, no white
fumes were produced by the inflammation.
By agitating the residue with Potash 2 2/3 only
remained, which [deletion]gave[/deletion] suffered a considerable diminu-
tion by the addition of Nitrous gas
3[superscript]nd[/superscript] Exp[superscript]t[/superscript].. 7 of the gas & rather more than 7 of oxygene
diminished by agitation to 10. - It was then
well agitated in a solution of potash & diminished
to 8. & by the electric spark to 4. by the
addition of 7 of Nitrous gas, to about 7 -
