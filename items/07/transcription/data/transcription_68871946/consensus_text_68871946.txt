Exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] on the action of Voltaic electricity on the
Sulphuret of Carbon. with mercury in the tube

[Horizontal rule]
By the first contacts, the liquor, assumed the gaseous
state & blackened the inside of the tube - The
light produced was very vivid & of a beautiful
yellowish green colour. The expansion reached
its maximum in a short time, when the conducting
power of the fluid seemed much weakened - The
tube with its contents allowed to cool was trans-
ferred into the water apparatus, a black oily fluid
fell to the bottom, & the gas was partially absorbed
-  The remainder it was that was examined -

briskly & diminished to 7, by agitation with a
solution of Potash diminished to 5 . 4 more of
oxygene added again diminished to 7, (at each in -
flammation white fumes were produced), by agitation
with Potash diminished to 5 - A slight diminution occas
ioned by the [underline]addition of Nitrous gas[/underline]. probably the
oxygene not very pure.
Some of the same gas which was suffered to remain
in a solution of caustic potash was almost wholly absorbed
similar to sulphuretted hydrogene gas. -
Electrized without Mercury. ie by two platina
wires in a straight tube closed at one end, at each
contact a most intensely vivid greenish yellow light
was excited, with the disengagement of gas - at the

the liquor, the Platina wire in some places seem'd to be
