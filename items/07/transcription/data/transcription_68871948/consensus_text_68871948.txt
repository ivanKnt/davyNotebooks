An exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] to ascertain whether any heat sensible to
the Thermometer is produced by the electric flame in

The jar [deletion]in[/deletion] which contained the apparatus, consisting of
a concave plated mirror, so situated as to collect the
light radiating from the charcoal, & to concentrate them
on the bulb of a mercurial thermometer which together with
the wires holding the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] two pieces of charcoal, passed through
a collar of leather - No heat was apparently produced by the
light excited in vacu[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]o - The air being introduced immediately
the column of mercury rose - The light in vacuo was in
part of a beautiful blue [deletion]light[/deletion] [insertion]colour[/insertion] & attended with bright red
scintillations -
In this form of the experiment there was
an ascending current of air which must have
raised the thermometer much heat must have
been produced by the combustion of the charcoal
to try another form; the radiation being
from above & the receiver filled with Hydrogen

Therm .
In vacu[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]o, the light concentrated on the bulb of a
Thermometer raised the mercury 6 degrees in 2 1/2
minutes, in common air the mercury fell in 5 minutes
- 1/2 - degree & in hydrogene it fell in 25 minutes 4 degrees
