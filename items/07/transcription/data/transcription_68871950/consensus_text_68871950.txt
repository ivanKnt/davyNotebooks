Nitrous gas to 1 cubical inch
Therefore - 4/10 of oxygene were [unclear][deletion]xxx[/deletion][/unclear] existing
but there were 7.1 of Gas - of this [underline]3.1 oxygene[/underline]
4 Nitrogene reckoning losses . & 3.5 - ie 6 of
oxygene introduced & 6.5 absorbed; but there is a loss
of 4 . 3 Hydrogene [insertion]1. Nitrogene at least[/insertion] examination of the residual gas unabsor-

[Horizontal rule]
11 measures of it detonated with 7 of oxygene &..
diminished to 4. 1/2
again 9 of the this gas & 4 of oxygene diminish[superscript]d[/superscript]

This day . endeavored to procure
Tellurium by making the oxide into a paste
with oil. mixing it with powdered charcoal
& giving it a strong cherry red heat in a
retort of glass - 100 grains of oxide
were used but; very little metal sublimed not
I should think ten grains & the process was
carried on for half an hour.
- This quantity was however
sufficient to confirm the fact
that [underline]tellurium[/underline] gives gas at the + pole
& does not give Hydrogene but a brown
powder at the positive pole
