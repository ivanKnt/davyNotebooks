- To try if Tellurium will give -
gas - in [underline]Muriatic acid[/underline]
Tellurium in Muriatic in Sulphuric
& in diluted sulphuric & Muriatic acids
gives [underline]No[/underline] purple precipitate but the
peculiar [underline]fetid gas[/underline]: & there are separated
from it metallic films & likewise dark
brown films - . -
The compounds of tellurium containing
Hydrogene [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] affect silver, copper &
different solutions not unlike sulphuretted
[underline]Hydrogene[/underline]; so that they must form
triple compound like sulphuretted
[underline]Hydrogene[/underline]. -
Again Nitric acid does not
give [deletion]the[/deletion] any gas; but the acid
becomes green ie Nitrous gas is
[underline]formed[/underline]:- but with diluted acid it
behaves as with the other -
When Tellurium was melted in
[underline]Ammonia[/underline] & [underline]strongly heated[/underline], it did
not seem to change but pure metallic
[unclear]spicula[/unclear] lined the interior & cooler part
of the retort so that it sublimed
[underline]unaltered[/underline]. -
A former experiment proved its solubility
in [underline]Hydrogene;[/underline] . & the combustible Nature of
