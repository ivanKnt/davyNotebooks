An exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] to decompose Nitrogene
a bladder filled with Nitrogene was [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion]
tied to a tubulated retort, the neck of which
terminated in an earthen ware tube which was
connected with the water pneumatic apparatus by
a bent glass tube. - The apparatus was made
air tight - When the tube was red hot, a lamp
was placed under the retort containing mangane
common salt & sulphuric acid in the proportion
to make oxymuriatic acid gas. after a consider
able quantity of oxymuriatic acid gas had passed
over, the Nitrogene was driven over by pressing
the bladder - The gas was non no longer clear
as before, but turbid with white fumes. The
smell of it was nearly the same as that
of muriatic acid gas - It extinguished a
lighted taper plunged into it - after it had
ceased to be produced, a few drops of muriatic
acid, were found in the tube mixed with
Nitric acid [Horizontal rule]
With lime it gave no indications of ammonia -
