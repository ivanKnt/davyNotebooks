on the decomposition of ammonia by [unclear]Potassium[/unclear]
Barom. 29.5 Thermom. 61
The copper tube contains 4 cubical inches
Residual gas with the gas generated
4 cubical inches - 11 of this gas with 6
of oxygene diminished to 8, 6 of oxygene added
again diminished to 9, 5 more of oxygene , did not
again inflame
2[superscript]d[/superscript] exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] 11 of the gas & 10 of oxygene diminished to 8, 8
more of oxygene added, again diminished to 15
Examination of the gas procured by distillation of
the olive brown substance

10 of the gas with 6 of oxygene diminished to
9
The whole quantity of Gas certainly
did not [underline]amount to[/underline] - 16 cubical inches
& in these there was a great excess
of what appeared to be Nitrogene -
6 grains of Potassium used in this
exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. which [underline]absorbed[/underline] full 12 cubical inches
[underline]of Ammonia[/underline]; but the copper, Zinc & Solder [unclear]evidently[/unclear]
