Monday 25 -
The capacity of the balloon in which the gases are
to be weighed 16.5 cubical inch measures -
A cubic inch measure of distilled water weighed
[unclear]261[/unclear] grs -
The ammoniacal gas contained not 1/100 of unabsorbable
air -
525 of [insertion]a cubic inch[/insertion] Nitrous gas was diminished by agitation in
a solution of green sulphat of Iron to . 500.
. 500 of a cubical inch of oxygene was diminished
by Nitrous gas [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] about . 475.
a large quantity of oxymuriatic acid gas
came over, before any was preserved for
weighing -
The Muriatic acid gas was contaminated with
about 1/50, or less of unabsorbable gas - -
The olefiant gas remained over water three
days to purify it from sulphurous acid gas
The Hydrogene was made by means of Zinc
& dilute sulphuric acid - 10 measures of it with
10 of common air fired or fixed[/unclear] by the electric spark
diminished to 13 - with 10 more of common air
diminished to 17, another portion of common air being
added, there was no father diminution -
The ammonical gas was dried by Potash & the [unclear]muriatic[/unclear]
[insertion]by muriat of Lime[/insertion] [Horizontal rule]
Barom.[superscript]r[/superscript] 30.1
[deletion]The balloon full of common air [unclear]weighs[/unclear][/deletion]
The balloon exhausted to 29.3 = 0
filled with 15 cubical inches of air = 4 3/4 grains
filled with 15.75 of ammonia = 2. 5/8
filled with 16 of Muriatic gas = 7 11/16 but after
weighing it, a very small globule of Mercury
was found in the Balloon
