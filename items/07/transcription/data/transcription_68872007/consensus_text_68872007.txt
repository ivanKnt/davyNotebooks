filled with 16 of Nitrous gas = 6 1/8
with 16 1/2 of oxymuriatic = 12 [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] 5/8
But the balloon exhausted weighted over 9/16 more
than it did at first, the weight of the gas was therefore
12 5/8 - 9/16 = 12 . 062
With 13 of oxygene = 4 1/2
Exhausted weighted as before
Filled with 16 of Hydrogene = 1/2
Exhausted weighed as before
Filled with 15 of olefiant gas = 5 1/4
Exhausted weighed as before
In the three last exp[superscript]t.s[/superscript] the exhaustion was
made only to 23.9 - The Barom. 29.55. Ther. 60
Filled with 14 of Nitrous gas = 4 1/2
Exhausted weighed 1/32 heavier than before
This nitrous gas contains about 1/20 of gas
not absorbable by green Sulphat of Iron
The 14 measures of gas weigh 4 1/2 - 1/32 = 4.468
Filled with 16 of Muriatic gas = 6 1/7
Exhausted it weighed 1/9 more than before
The Muriatic gas did not contain 1/100 of
common air - It was not dried by muriat of Lime -
During all the exp[superscript]t.s[/superscript] the stop-cocks were
perfectly tight, & the Balloon stood a whole night
exhausted with the vacuum perfect - -
Barom. 29.6 . Therm. 59
Abstracting the air or Nitrogene with which the gasses
were contaminated [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]100[/unclear] cubical inch measures of each will
weigh as follows
Common air 31.666 grs Hydrogene 3.125
ammoniacal gas 16.526 olefiant gas 35.000
oxymuriatic 71.890 Nitrous gas 31.9848
oxygene 34.6298 Muriatic gas 38.4673
