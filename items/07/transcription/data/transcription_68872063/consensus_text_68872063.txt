[underline]Exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] to procure the fuming liquor of Boyle[/underline]
3 oz of Lime which had been heated to redness
for the purpose. 1 oz of sal. ammoniac in it's common
state & 3/4 of an ounce of Sulphur were mixed
together & put into an earthen ware retort luted
the neck of the retort terminated in a receiver
sunk in water & connected with another - the
heat was gradually raised to redness, before
which, white fumes of a strong ammoniacal
smell came over - The red heat was continued
for more than an hour - When on opening the
vessels, a dark amber coloured fluid was found
in the lower receiver, fuming & emitting a
powerful smell of ammonia mixed with one
very similar to that of Lampadius liquor - - - -
The liquor added to Phosphuretted muriatic acid
occasioned it's inflammation -
It did not mix readily with the liquor of
Lampadius or Ether -
When acted on by Voltaic electricity it gave
off gas at both poles - but not so copiously
as when more diluted with water -
It evaporates fast in the air & produces
much cold - & leaves a hydrat of Sulphur
When Potassium is thrown into it
it burns with [underline]a yellow light[/underline] : & [unclear]swims[/unclear]
of the surface. -
It has [underline]the habits[/underline] of an aqueous
solution
