Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. to ascertain of acid & alkali are formed
from Water electrized in oxygen --
Two platina cones which had been digested in Nitrous
acid & well washed in distilled water were connected
together by filaments of asbestos which had been puri-
fied by boiling distilled water. The cones being filled
with water distilled in a glass vessel that did not
produce cloudiness in Nitrate of silver, & the asbestos
moistened with the same kind were placed in
a receiver standing on an adapter to the air pump.
The proper arrangement being made to connect the
cones with the battery, the receiver was exhausted
& filled with oxygen .& and the cones were connected
with [deletion]the[/deletion] a battery of 160 double plates in weak action
giving only a spark just sensible on contact. The expt
was in hand two days. When no acid or alkali sensible
to turmeric or Litmus paper was found to be
generated. The oxygen appeared perfectly pure. an
extinguished taper inflamed in it -
The oxygen used was made from oxymuriat of
Potash & [insertion]not[/insertion] received till perfectly pure -

As a comparative expt a similar one was made
with the same apparatus [deletion]ammon[/deletion] exposed to the
atmosphere. At the end of two days no acid
or alkali was found to be generated through
the action of the battery was brisker than
before -- [Horizontal rule]
but after the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] & after the connecting
substrate had been touched by the [unclear]fingers[/unclear]
there was [unclear]in[/unclear] very sensible red [unclear]tinge[/unclear] given
to the [underline]paper [deletion]& the[/deletion][/underline] & [unclear]blue[/unclear] to the other
