At eleven in the morning -
there was no diminution in either
case [unclear][deletion]xx[/unclear][/deletion] but the mercury in
two tubes had become black &
filmy. -
a little heat was applied to
the large tube by an iron; but
no effect was produced -
- Another mixture was made &
electrified but there seemed after
ten or 12 shocks to be no
change.
"Another mixture" was made
[underline]of 8. & 8:[/underline] & a little
oxygene added this produced
a little whiteness. but the
effect [underline]did not go on[/underline]. - ie
the case was the same as
in the other instance - a
little water [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] introduced did
not seem to accelerate
it -
