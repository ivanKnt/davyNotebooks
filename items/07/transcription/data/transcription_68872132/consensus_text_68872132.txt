heated where the combination was to
take place, before the metal which was
separate from the sulphur, was melted
down on it - The increase of gas amounted
to about 1/10 of a cubic inch, the volume of
hydrogen employed was 85/100 of a cubic
inch.

inch & 1/10 of gas, of which 64/100 of a cubic
inch was absorbed by water, the remainder
burnt silently like hydrogen holding a
little sulphur in solution -
The tube being broken, the superficial
coating of black matter which adhered
to the glass did not when separated

strong muriatic acid, it did not
appear to be affected by it.
1 grain of Sulphur & 65/100 of a gr of
Potassium combined in a green glass retort
