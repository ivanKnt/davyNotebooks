ceased, no more than 2/10 of a cubic
inch remained, though before the agitation
judging from the quantity of mercury
in the retort at least 45/100 of a cubic
 inch was produced - After the absorption
by the acid or sulphur, still gas in
small portions was emitted, but no
attempt was made to ascertain the
whole quantity of gas given off -
To ascertain whether the acid was
saturated with gas, 6/10 of cubic of
Sulphuretted Hydrogen were admitted
into a tube over mercury & 2/10 of a
cubic inch of the acid added, by
agitation 35/100 of a cubic inch was absorbed.
Transferred to Water 2/10 more were
absorbed by the water the 65/100 inflamed
like hydrogen-
In the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. before the last, the acid
appeared to be saturated, for no absor-
ption of the gas, was sensible on
agitation - -.
