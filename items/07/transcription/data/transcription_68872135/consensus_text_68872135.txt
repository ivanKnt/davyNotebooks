2 grs of fine Iron were afforded by
solution in [insertion]dilute[/insertion] Sulphuric acid 3.2 cubic
inches of Hydrogen -
2 grs of the same kind of Iron wire
afforded by solution in dilute muriatic
acid 3.2 cubic inches of Hydrogen
Ther.
February 23 Barom.
10 grs of Phosphorus & 1.25 of Potassium
without light - The hydrogen in the tube
amounted to .85[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] cubic inches, during the
formation of the Phosphuret 15/100 of a c.I. was
evolved - by the action of strong muriatic
acid on the phosphuret 1.15 cu. inch [deletion]of a[/deletion]
of gas was produced -
10 grs of Phosphorus & 1.25 of Potassium
were combined together in hydrogen - The
combination was accompanied with the
production of heat & light, but only in
a slight degree - 1.32.
[deletion]3/100 [unclear]of Potassium[/unclear][/deletion] 9/10 of a grain of
Potassium were heated in a green
glass retort containing about 3.87 cubic
inches of Phosphuretted Hydrogen previously
dried by muriat of Lime - The Phosphuret
was formed without any sensible inflammation
occurring, it rose in that form of a brownish
black sublimate - The volume of gas when
cold was found to have been increased
1/2 of a cubic inch - Thrown into the air
