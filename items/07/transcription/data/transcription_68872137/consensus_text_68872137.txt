3/10 of a grain of Potassium were heated
in a green glass retort in 1 & 75/100 of a cubic
inch of Phosphuretted Hydrogen, the Phosphuret
was formed as usual, contiguous to the brownish
[deletion]sublim[unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] black sublimate, a fine yellow precipitate
of Phosphorus appeared lining part of the in-
terior bulb of the retort, this in the preceding
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] was constantly observed -
The volume of gas was increased about
2/10 of a cubic inch, it did not inflame in
the air -
The gas afforded by the Phosphuret
by the action of strong muriatic acid
was about 1/10 of a cubic inch, it did
inflame spontaneously in the air -
7/10 of Potassium were heated in [deletion][unclear]two[/unclear][/deletion] 2
cubic inches of Phosphuretted Hydrogen, the
phosphuret was formed with the usual
phenomena, in this instance as well as in
the preceding, at the moment of combination
white cloudes were perceived issuing from
the bulb of the retort down the neck -
The volume of gas was increased by
2/10 of a cubic inch, it was not spontaneously
inflammable in the air -
The Phosphuret gave off by the action of
strong muriatic acid 6/10 of gas; that did
not inflame on coming into the atmosphere
