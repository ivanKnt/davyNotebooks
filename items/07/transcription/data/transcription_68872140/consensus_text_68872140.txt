6/10 of a grain of Potassium & 10 grs of
Sulphur combined with the usual phenomena
in a white glass retort lined with sulphur
& half full of dry hydrogen gas - When
the combination took place a greenish vapour
appeared falling down the neck of the retort
where when cold it condensed -
The original quantity of gas was 1.4 it
increased to 1.45 -
The sulphuret appeared of a fine red colour
from cinnabar which was formed at the
same time. & remained in the retort undissolved by [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
The retort was filled with mercury.
The sulphuret decomposed by 2/10 of a cubic
inch of Muriatic acid nearly saturated with
sulphuretted hydrogen gave off 6/10 of a cubic
inch of gas absorbed by Water -
1 2/10 of a grain of Potassium were combined
with Sulphur in a smaller quantity than
before in a white glass retort containing
of Hydrogen - The increase of gas by
the formation of the sulphuret amounted
to
The sulphuret gave off by the action
of muriatic acid about 1 cubic inch of
gas, but the quantity was not accurately
ascertained, because the tube happens [unclear]insertion]as[/unclear][/insertion] by
accident to break before the mark
was made -
