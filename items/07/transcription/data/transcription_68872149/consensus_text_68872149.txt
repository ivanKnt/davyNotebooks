The fusible substance from 6 grs of Potassium
was heated with 1[unclear]0[/unclear] of Boracic acid - gas given
off 5 3/4 of this 3 1/2 remained unabsorbed by
water - 9 1/2 measures of this gas detonated without
any additional oxygene & diminished to 6 - 4 3/4 of
common air more added, no inflammation

3 grs of good Potassium were converted
into the fusible substance -
The fusible substance covered with 6
grs of powdered boracic acid were heated
in the bored platina tube which was
connected with the mercury by a glass
tube. - Gas was produced by the usual heat
but I suspect some of it was absorbed
by passing through the mercury, though
the receiver employed had previously
contained ammonia - The platina tube
was gradually heated to whiteness, & this
heat was continued till gas no Longer
expelled -
The gas produced was no more than
1 1/2 cubic inch & it was with the exception
of about 1/5 of a cubic inch [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]entirely[/unclear]
