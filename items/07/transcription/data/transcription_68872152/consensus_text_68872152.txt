The Platina tray in which the Potassium was
to be converted into the fusible substance
weighed after being heated to redness 53 8/10 grs
5 1/2 grs of Potassium were converted into the
fusible substance - The retort was twice exhausted
& filled with hydrogene - 12 1/2 cubic inches
of ammonia entered. -
The fusible substance covered with about
5 grs of powdered boracic acid, was heated
in a retort partly filled with hydrogene & partly
exhausted - an effervescence was immediately
produced in one part of the tray, on the
first application of heat. In the greatest
part the action, though the retort was
heated till it softened, the action was
very gentle - No more than about
3 cubic inches of Ammonia were thus
produced. And the tray transferred
to a platina tube & heated to whiteness
gave off no more gas - The air that
came over being common air from
the tube -
