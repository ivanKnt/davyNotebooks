After the Boracic acid was reduced
to the state of a glass, it was kept
in a white heat, till it no long er
contained air bubbles - and in order
to insure the total dissipation of it's
water it was again intensely heated ,
but during this operation a few grains
of charcoal fell into the fused acid,
& though red hot & covered with the
acid, yet they gave off gas till entire
ly consumed -
The Iron filings were kept in a
red heat for more than a quarter of
an hour in an earthen crucible covered.
They weighed 680 grs , they were placed
in the Iron gun barrel luted & conn
ected by a glass tube with mercury
& the whole was made air tight -
The barrel was heated nearly to
whiteness, a few bubbles of common air
were alone expelled from the tube -
100 grs of the fused boracic acid
were added , in pieces , still warm - The
apparatus being tight apparently , the fire

whole exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was just the same , as that kept
up during the making of Potassium - During
the first quarter of an hour , the gas
came over pretty fast . it nearly filled
a small jar of 6 cubic inches - the heat
was raised as high as nearly as possible
for another quarter of an hour without
producing more gas - The gas received
