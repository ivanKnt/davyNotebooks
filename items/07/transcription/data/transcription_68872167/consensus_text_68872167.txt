300 grs of pure potash, in the same state
as it came from the shop, where placed
in an Iron barrel luted & [deletion]around[/deletion] 900 grs
of Iron filings which had been previously
heated to redness were added - The
barrel was connected with a pneu-
matic water apparatus by a bent
glass tube & to prevent the admission
of aqueous vapour the extremity
of the tube was plunged into a
cup of mercury under water -
The whole apparatus being found
tight, the tube was brought to
a dull red heat when inflammable
gas was rapidly evolved, this soon
became a bright red heat, which
was continued for an hour, during
which time about 53 cubic inches
of Hydrogene were produced, towards
the end, the gas came over gradually
slower & at the end it had ceased -
The bellows was then blown, & a
strong white heat was kept up
for about half an hour, when the
gas that the increase of heat
produced, ceased to be evolved
& a rapid absorption, rendered it
necessary to stop the operation &
close the mouth of the tube -
11 cubic inches of Hydrogene were
procured -
