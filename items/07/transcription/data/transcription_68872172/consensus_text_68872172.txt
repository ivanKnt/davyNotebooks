26 1/4 cubic inches of ammonia in the
[deletion]retort[/deletion][insertion]receiver[/insertion] - the fusible substance from 6 grs
of Potassium was covered with fused boracic
acid in powder, & returned into the same
retort in which it was made - its weight
being previously ascertained - the retort
was exhausted & placed over the receiver
containing 26 1/4 of ammonia - turning
the stop stopcocks 20 cubic inches entered the
retort (diminution of pressure 2 cubic inches)
the stop cocks were left open - heat
was applied to the retort by means
of a spirit lamp - it required a pretty
considerable degree, to make the boracic
acid act on the fusible substance - part
of the acid was rendered black & a very
slight effervescence was produced where
the fusible substance was most exposed
to the acid, the mixture where the action
was greatest only entered into imperfect
fusion, from the acid powder becoming
agglutinated by the fusible substance -
When all appearance of action had ceased -
the heat was with drawn & the retort allowed
to cool - When cold the gas in the receiver
amounted to 8 1/3 cubic inches - Therefore
only about 2 cubic inchs were produced -
The platina tray taken quickly from
the retort to the balance, without the
smallest portion of it's contents being lost
weighed not quite 4/10 of a [insertion]grain.[/insertion] [deletion]cubic inch[/deletion]
less - It was placed in a glass tube
& cemented, to be preserved for further
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
