Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. in the triple compound of oxymur-
iatic acid. Phosphorus & ammonia
[Horizontal rule]
To make the compound of oxymuriatic
acid & Phosphorous, a small piece of
Phosphorus was placed in a retort -
When the retort was filled with
oxymuriatic acid gas, the phosphorus
took fire & burnt with a bright
white light, till entirely consumed -
The product was a very fine
white sublimate, which rose in
vapour at a heat apparently below
that of boiling water - When the bellows
was blown into the retort to
expel the remaining oxymuriatic
acid, muriatic acid gas was
formed in great abundance & the
sublimate appeared to afford it - for
the sublimate diminished very fast -
Note - A very minute quantity of
a white fluid was formed by the
action of the oxymuriatic acid gas
on the Phosphorus -
This exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated, no fluid
product obtained, the white sublimate
the same as before -
The retort containing the white
sublimate was exhausted by means
of the air pump - ammoniacal gas
was admitted into it from a receiver -
a combination immediately took place
