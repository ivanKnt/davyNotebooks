Phosphorus - When no more ammonia

applied to the bulb of the retort - a
fresh sublimate was formed in the neck
of the retort, which was very crystallized -
The retort was heated by a charcoal
fire, till it began to soften - The

a red heat -
The retort was broken & the
white matter was collected - It had
the appearance of oxide of Zinc - It
was perfectly insipid - not altered by

When heated on a plate of glass white
vapours in great plenty arose having the
appearance of muriat of ammonia - they
appeared to be neutral, they had no smell

a large proportion of white matter fixed -
This substance remained unaltered in
boiling nitric & muriatic acid, it
was not dissolved in a strong boiling
solution of Potash - It bore a bright
red heat in a close green glass
tube, without volatilizing - Heated to
redness in a small platina [deletion][unclear]tube[/unclear][/deletion] vessel, a
