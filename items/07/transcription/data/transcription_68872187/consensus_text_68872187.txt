like phosphoric glass remained - The
peculiar fixed compound acted by
strong Sulphuric acid evolved a
smell of muriatic acid gas - The
action was very weak even at
the boiling temperature of the acid -
When the peculiar substance was thrown
into fused Potash, violent action was
produced, accompanied by ignition at
the surface - The smell of ammonia
was produced - the compound of the
fixed alkali was dissolved by
water, when neutralized, no precipi-
tate was occasioned -
The same changes took place
apparently when the peculiar
substance was acted on, in the
midst of the fused potash in a
platina cone -
It appeared to be nearly of the

for when first thrown into this fluid
it did not sink, but when agitated
it remained nearly at rest at different
depths. - .
It appeared to burn when exposed on
a thin metallic plate to the flame of a spirit
lamp - a globule of glass remained -
When heated in a small green glass tube
with Potassium, the metal inflamed - the changes
