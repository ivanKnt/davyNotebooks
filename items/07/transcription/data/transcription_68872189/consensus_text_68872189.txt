ate the liquor - the white precipitate
was formed in great abundance - it rose
in vapour at a heat below that of redness
& was entirely dissipated by continuing
the heat - no oxide of Tin was separated.

Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. on Sulphur & Potassium -
A white glass retort was lined with
sulphur by fusing the sulphur in the
bulb - 1.32 cub. in - of dry hydrogene being
admitted. a grain of Potassium pressed out
into a thin plate was added - on heating
[unclear]the[/unclear] retort the combination of the sulphur
& metal produced vivid ignition - The
retort was not injured - when cold the
gas amounted to 1.57 so that there was
.25 generated - The retort was filled
with mercury - muriatic acid saturated
with Sulphuretted hydrogene was added -
next morning 1 1/10 of gas was produced
& the sulphuret appeared decomposed - This
gas consisted of 1.02 of suphuretted
hydrogene & of .08 of hydrogene - the former
quantity was absorbed by water - the latter
inflamed -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated & the [insertion][unclear]1[/unclear] gr of[/insertion] Potassium
being in a round [deletion]lump[/deletion] piece - The heat
produced by the combination was so great
as to break the retort which was of white
glass & much thicker than the retort
first used - The bulb which appeared
