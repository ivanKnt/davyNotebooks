33 of ammonia, 9.33 of oxymuriatic acid
1.15 of ammonia + . 95 Nitrogene = 2.0
9.33 - the capacity of the retort
A dry green glass retort of 9.33
cubic inches capacity, containing some
fused muriat of lime, was exhausted
& filled with oxymuriatic - The
retort was then connected with a
receiver containing 25 of dry & pure
ammonia - The stop-cocks being turned
an immediate absorption of the am
monia took place - dense white fumes
were produced & so much heat was
evolved that the cement about the
stopcock melted - The whole 25 of am-
were absorbed, 8 more of am. were
also absorbed (25 + 8 = 33) when the
oxymuriatic acid was perfectly saturated
Some of the gas of the retort, was
expelled by heat it consisted of
1.15 ammonia & .95/100 Nitrogene -
5.36 ammonia
