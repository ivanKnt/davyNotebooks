Made a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. to
ascertain the composition of muri-
atic acid gas by heating tin &
Zinc in this gas & also mercury
Submuriats appeared always to
be formed, which were of a yellow
ish colour when fluid , but white
when cold - Zinc decomposes the
gas more rapidly than either of
the other metals - a cubic inch
of gas is perfectly decomposed in
about 5 minutes , agitating the melted
Zinc greatly accelerates the action -
The exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. most to be depended
on was made with Zinc -
A piece of polished Zinc was
placed in a small green glass
retort & filled with mercury
