a portion of muriatic acid gas
was added (30 measures of this gas contained
3 1/2 of common air) the retort was
immediately transferred to a long
jar & the gas being brought to
the level - a mark was made.
no mercury was in contract with
the Zinc - The Zinc was then
fused with a spirit lamp, an
immediate absorption commenced,
the melted globule was rapidly
covered with a crust of sulphat
which was disturbed by agitation -
When the absorption appeared to
have reached it's height, the
mercury [deletion]was again[/deletion] when the
retort was cold was again
brought to the level & marked -
Transferred to water all the
muriatic acid gas had disappeared
for there was no absorption -
The residual gas was then trans
ferred & the measurements
made -
The original quantity of gas used
was .80/100 of a cubic I. or .71/100 of
pure muriatic acid gas - [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
What remained after the whole
of the gas was decomposed
amounted to .48/100 or 39/100 of Hydrogen
Supposing that the mercury was
previous to heating entirely free
from air & supposing that the
muriatic acid gas did not
