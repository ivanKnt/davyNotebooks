Tried a set of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
in the decomposition of Sulpureous
acid by Sulphuretted Hydrogene
acted best when Sulphureous acid
was in great excess ie more than
double.
1. Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. 227 Sulphuretted H[superscript]e[/superscript].
125 Sulphureous acid -
left 83 containing Sulphureted
Hydrogene -
- [unclear]In[/unclear] 144 of Sulphuretted Hydrogene
[unclear]or[/unclear] decompose 96 of Sulphureous acid
[unclear]xx[/unclear] would take 72 cubical inches of oxygene
This would take 72 cubical inches of oxygene
but 100 cubical inches of oxygene & make
[deletion][unclear]8x[/unclear] water[/deletion] 26 of oxygene to make Sulphuric
acid; but
But If 100 : 34 : 22

204 26.4 oxygene
[underline]68[/underline] 7 grains of Sulphur
to make. 18 of Sulphuric

3 Hydrogene} nearly 1 of Sulphuric acid
