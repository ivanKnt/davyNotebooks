{ To try to decompose
{ Muriatic acid by Phosphorus
{ & Sulphur.
{ [Horizontal rule]
{ no decomposition
Tried an exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on the Solution
[underline]of Platina[/underline] - used the fuming
acid & got no [underline]oxymuriatic acid.[/underline]
- but Nitrous vapour in
great abundance ie probably
[underline]a compound of Muriatic[/underline] acid
[underline]gas & Nitrous vapour[/underline]. -
The oxymuriatic acid is
given off abundantly from
a mixture of about 3
of [underline]Nitric[/underline] & 1 of Muriatic
acid both. strong.
Platina has nothing to
Do. -
1 of the oxymuriatic acid. -
[unclear]condenses[/unclear] 1 of [underline]Hydrogene[/underline] -
