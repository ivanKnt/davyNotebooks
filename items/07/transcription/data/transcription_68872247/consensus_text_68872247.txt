2 grains of tinfoil (carefully weighed S. [deletion][unclear]x[/deletion][/unclear][superscript]t[/superscript] 
were introduced into a dry & clean green glass
retort. - the retort was then exhausted
& 19 3/4 Cub. In of oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]. gas entered. -
No inflammation occurred on the admission
of the gas. but a slight reddish grey fume
was perceived .. & the tinfoil partially lost
its metallic lustre; - On the application
of heat. 2 or 3 minute particles separated
from the foil & burnt brilliantly with slight
scintillation.. - When the metal became
fused. it burnt [insertion]silently[/insertion] with a lambent yellowish
white flame & the crust remained red hot
for some time after the lamp was taken
away. - . after the retort had cooled
2 cubical Inches of gas were absorbed. -
- Heat was again applied - there was
no further inflammation. but the thin
Crust assumed a somewhat lighter colour. -
When the retort had cooled a second time
1/2 Cub. In. of gas entered. -
[superscript]x[/superscript] 2 1/4 Cub. In. of gas were absorbed by }

And [underline]2 1/2[/underline] Cub. In afterwards
[underline]4 3/4[/underline] Cub. In. absorbed by 2 grains
of tinfoil . -
The retort was heated & cooled for a third time
but there was no farther absorption. -
[superscript]+[/superscript] The capacity of the retort was 17 1/2 Cub. In. measured
by introducing com[superscript]m[/superscript]. air. - but 19 3/4. entered
Hence 2 1/4 absorbed.
But this gas cont[superscript]d[/superscript]. rather more than 1/3 unabsorbable
by water. }
