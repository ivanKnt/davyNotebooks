- In two sets of Exp[superscript]t[/superscript] made with
all care 5 grains of Potassium converted
in fusible substance
distilled with 10 grains of
Boracic acid quite dry - lost in
weight in an air tight tube, exactly 1 3/8
of a grain; but there is every reason to
believe that a part of this loss was
occasioned by Boracic acid thrown out
of the tube, every thing in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was
made under pressure & in vacuo -
[underline]After cooling[/underline] about a tenth of a
cubical inch of gas only [deletion]altered[/deletion] [insertion]passed out of [/insertion]the
tube
So that about 6 cubical inches which
was the capacity of the tube were
generated.
but this tube must have contained
about 1/2 a cubical inch of
common air -.
- Some of the [insertion]unabsorbable[/insertion] gas driven out by
