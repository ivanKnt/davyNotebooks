A little water appeared to be
generated, or liberated.-
the carbonat of ammonia was
sublimed-. when the retort was
cold there was an increase of
8/10 of a cubic inch--
The retort was again heated
but instead of there being an
expansion as before there was
an absorption of 1/10 of a cubic
inch .-
34 measures of the oxymuriatic
gas used contained 13 of unabsorbable
gas--
6 3/4 of the residual gas, unabsorbed
by a solution of Potash - 7 1/4 Hydrogene
no diminution.-
5 1/2 of the unabsorbable gas mixed with
the oxy. mu. & 3 1/2 Hyd. diminution to
5 1/2 - 2 3/4 more of Hydrogene - no
further diminution.-
The residual gas unabsorbed by P. amounted
to 4/10 of a C.I-
What was absorbed by the solution
of Potash amounted to 2.9 cub. inches, which
is inferred to be Carbonic acid - -
