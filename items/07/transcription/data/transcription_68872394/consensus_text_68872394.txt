About 2 cubic inches of Carbonic
acid saturated with Ammonia --
2.6 of chlorine gas entered -
After half an hour 1/10 expansion -
The salt lining the whole of the
interior of the tube was sublimed
from about 1/4 of it - when cold -
there was an expansion of 3/10 of a
C In. -
The remaining salt unsublimed was
sublimed - it had just the appearance
of the white sublimate of P. & C. forming
a fine fleece where it condensed, &
when heated, separating from the place
where it adhered before it volatilized.
When cold the expansion was 2/10 of a
cubic inch -
The tube was again heated in
part the expansion now was only
about 1/20 of a C I. when cold.-
When the stop-cock was removed
white fumes in plenty were immediately
produced- their smell was exceedingly
pungent & peculiar.- they did not
change the colour of dry or moist
turmeric paper- - nor of dry litmus
but they reddened it when moistened -
The salt itself was exceedingly
sharp to the taste & peculiar.-
Thrown into water it dissolved
rapidly emitting air [unclear]bubbles[/unclear] -
Some part of the salt changed
the colour of Turmeric & gave off
