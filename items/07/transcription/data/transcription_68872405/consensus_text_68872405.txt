5 grs of the common carbonat of
magnesia - 2.3 cub. inches of chlorine
gas entered - There was no apparent
action at the moment - After 1/2
hour there appeared no alteration
in the colour of the gas - there
was an absorption of 1/20 of a cub. Inch
The retort was heated gently for
5 minutes without any apparent alteration
being produced.- When cold there was
an expansion of 6/10 of a cub. inch.-
It was heated a second time
more strongly, than at first the
green colour still remained.- There
was now an expansion of 9/10 of

The gas in the retort rendered
cloudy Lime water - it had [deletion]still[/deletion]

100 measures were agitated in
a solution of Potash 81 were absorbed.-
9 of the residual gas & 11 of Hydrogene -
diminution to 14.- No further- A cloudiness
was produced when the explosion took place -
The chlorine gas used was mixed with
1/7 of unabsorbable air - 6 of this & 8 of Hy.
