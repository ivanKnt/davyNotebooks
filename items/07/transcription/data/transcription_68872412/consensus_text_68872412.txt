About 5 grs of sub-carbonat of
ammonia in fine powder. -
3.8 cubic inches entered at once of
muriatic acid gas - white fumes
in plenty were produced immediately
In about 10 minutes there was
an absorption of 3 cubic inches more
No heat was applied in this
exp[superscript]t[/superscript].-
The gas in the retort after there
was no further absorption did not
contain the smallest portion of
muriatic gas-
150 measures of it were agitated
in a solu[superscript]t[/superscript]. of Potash - there was
an absorption of 135 measures.-
The capacity of the retort = 3.5 Cub. in
[Horizontal rule]
About 5 grs of the neutral carbonat
of Ammonia in fine powder.-
1.3 cub in of muriatic acid gas
entered - very slight fumes were produced.-
In a minute or two there was an
absorption of 3/10 of a cu. in.-
The salt was then shaken about the
retort- no absorption after this but
an expansion of 15/100 -
140 measures of the gas in the retort
consisted of 130 carbonic gas & 10
common air - No muriatic gas
remained in the retort.-
The absorption of 3/10 was partly produced
by a little moisture adhering to the stop-
cocks- for when they were separated
