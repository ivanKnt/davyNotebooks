was added - there was a fresh
absorption of 4/10 of a cub. in - The
residual gas therefore = 1.2 cub. in
When transferred to Water there was
an immediate absorption of 2/10 of a
cub. inch.-
The residual gas consisted of 8/10 of
carbonic acid gas & 2/10 of inflammable
gas.-
1 cubic inch of muriatic gas (the
same kind that as that before used) was
thrown up into a jar over mercury
containing about 5 grs of the neutral
carbonat of Ammonia formed by
exposing the common sub-carbonat to
the atmosphere.- The carbonat was
in a small glass tube.-
In about 10 minutes there was an
absorption of 1/10 of a cubic inch.-
When the gas was transferred to Water
there was an immediate absorption
of 2/10 .- agitated with a solution of
potash 6/10 were absorbed, the residue
= 1/10 was Hydrogene.-
2[superscript]d[/superscript]. exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. 1 cubic inch of muriatic
gas similar to the last was added
to about 3 grs of the neutral
carbonat of Ammonia after 1/4 hour there
was no absorption or expansion - the
gas in the receiver was exactly = 1 cub. inch
on transferring it to Water - there was
