1 cubic inch of muriatic gas (containing
1/10 of inflammable air) was [deletion]added[/deletion] thrown into
a receiver holding a small piece of the
common sub-carbonat of ammonia - The action
was very slow after several hours 3/10 were
absorbed - on transferring the residual
7/10 there was an immediate absorption of 1/10-
The remainder by agitation with potash
was diminished to 1/10 - which was inflam-
mable.- [Horizontal rule]
