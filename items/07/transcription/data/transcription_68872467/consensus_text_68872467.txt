In the first instance decomposition
of Nitrous [deletion]g[/deletion] oxide by Potassium
burns & forms a white matter
like Potash.- absorption about
1/50 . ie 50 parts gave 49
of Azote. -
In a second exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [deletion]the[/deletion]
in which less Potassium was
used 65 contracted to 62[superscript][unclear]o[/unclear][/superscript]
Nitrous oxide & Arsenic
the lowest mark -
When the arsenic is heated till it
sublimes - sudden flashes of light every
now & then appear. - the whole of the
gas very nearly was decomposed - 75
parts were increased to 76. -
Nitrous gas & arsenic
contained only 1/100 of Nitrogene
49/100 diminished to [unclear].43[/unclear] [deletion][unclear]xxxxx which[/unclear] will[/deletion]
the nitrous gas absorbed residue
8 - 8 -1/2 = 7.5 the nitrogene
6 the oxygene -
