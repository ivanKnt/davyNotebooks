7.5 gas + 10.5 oxymuriatic gas
detonated diminished to 8. - Much
charcoal deposited. - agitated dimi-
nution to 7 - + 5 oxy.[insertion]mur[/insertion] gas.
diminution to 7 - cloudiness
produced - agitated in a solution
of Potash diminished to 6 -
+ 2 oxy. mur gas - no further
diminution - the oxymuriatic gas
absorbed by Water the residual
& burnt like carbonic oxide. -
The original gas was what
remained [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] from olefiant gas
acted on by Potassium. -
The Potassium free from
Naptha when fused in
olefiant gas, became black
the whole interior of the
retort was blackened. -
after the metal had been
heated sometime &.
allowed to cool - there was
a slight increase. - heated
a second time & cooled
there was an absorption, the
gas returned to the orig
inal volume - Heated a third
time, there was a slight
absorption - no further

The gas above examined
