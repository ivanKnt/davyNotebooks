oxide & 2 of Hydrogene
& agitated it well with

95 oxymuriatic gas
95 olefiant gas
Brought together over mercury
condensation to 40 after
all action had ceased. -
Transferred to water an
immediate diminution to
30 -
Agitated diminished to 24
this residue burnt like
gaseous oxide of Carbon. -
The oxymuriatic gas contained
about 1 per cent of unabsorbable
