9.5 cubic inches Chlorine
The chlorine was mixed with about
1/40 unabsorbable air - 
Exposed for 20 hours alone in
the glass vessel greatest part of the time
to bright sunshine. - the colour
not apparently diminished - Now admitted
{ 3 cubic inches Hydrogene
Barom. 30.2 { 3 Carbonic oxide
In estimating the condensation allowance
to be made for 5.5 inches of Mercury
diminished pressure. -
Exposed to light for [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] about
20 hours - openned over dry mercury
6.5 cubic inches entered (diminished p.
1.75 inches) ie Barom: 30.2 & the
capacity of the glass vessel 17.75
cubic inches an absorption of
7.25 cubic inches of mercury.
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Part of the Chlorine remained
its colour though diminished was
still apparent - saturated with
ammonia - transferred to Water -
there remained unabsorbed
1.2 cub. inch which was not inflam
mable - it extinguished a light. -
it appeared to be common air &
Nitrogene -
The gases used in this
experiment had been dried
