[deletion][unclear]xxxx xxx of[/unclear][/deletion] Sulphur sublimed in it
no apparent alteration - the powerful
smell remained & the volume was
not changed -
6.0 cubic inches Ammonia
1.5 New Gas
Added together - great heat produced -
Condensation to 1.6 cubic inch
Residual gas transfered to Water
absorption to .3
Therefore 1.2 cub I. of the new gas
Condense 4.7 cub. Inches of Ammonia -
just 4 times it's own volume. -
Note the Ammonia used was quite
pure. - .
2.[superscript]d[/superscript] exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] 4 cubic inches Ammonia
0.97 New gas
Condensation to 1 cub. I. transfered
to Water diminution to [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] 0.2 - -
Hence it appears that it condenses
4 times it's volume. -
Added a little strong sulphuric
acid to the compound of the new gas
& Ammonia - effervescence - the whole
decomposed - there were 2 cubic inches
of gas produced - it fumed like
muriatic acid gas
15 measures of it once passed
through Water were immediately
