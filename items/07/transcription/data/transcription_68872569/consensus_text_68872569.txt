were also absorbed - Hence the
gas generated by the decomposition
of the new G. appears to consist of
1.333 Muriatic acid
[underline].666[/underline] Carbonic acid
[underline]2.000[/underline]
And hence the new gas seems
to consist of equal volumes of
Chlorine & Carbonic oxide condensed

Tin decomposes it. - Fused in
this gas in a small retort over
mercury Libavius' liquor was
rapidly formed - the heat [deletion]being [deletion][unclear]was[/unclear][/deletion][/deletion] was
applied only a few minutes. -
When cold there was not the
slightest change in volume -
transfered to Water - & agitated
there was a very slight absorption
but no more than might be
attributed to Carbonic oxide. -
the gas had entirely lost its
offensive smell - it burnt exactly
like Carbonic oxide. -
Zinc decomposes it just as
readily as Tin - there was no change
of volume - Carbonic oxide was
liberated & Horn Zinc formed. -
Arsenic sublimed in it, decom-
poses it, but not so rapidly as the
other two metals. - No change of
Volume. -
Sublimed Mercury in it -
