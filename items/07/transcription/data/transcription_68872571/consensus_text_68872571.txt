Lime was mixed with 1/22 of common air. -
22.5 measures Carbonic oxide
25 Chlorine
Mixed over recently boiled Mercury .-
Immediately exposed to the direct
rays of the Sun. -The combination
instantly began - the colour quickly
disappeared - the mercury rose
rapidly at first - slower afterwards
when it appeared to have ceased
the condensation was 20 measures -
Transfered to Water & agitated it
diminished to 3.25 - This burnt
like Carbonic oxide. -
Subtracting 1.13 the quantity
of air in the Chlorine there
remains 2.12 Carbonic oxide. -
Hence 20.38 Carbonic oxide combined -
21.52 Chlorine - Condensation 20. -
A little mercury appeared to be burnt -
The mixture was not exposed more than 2 or 3 minutes

6.5 cubic inches Hydrogene
5.0 Carbonic oxide. -
5.5 Chlorine
Exposed to bright sunshine for a
few hours the colour was quite
destroyed - opened over Mercury - a
slight absorption - the gas fumed
like muriatic acid gas & had the
peculiar smell of the new gas -
agitated with Water there was
first a rapid absorption of
