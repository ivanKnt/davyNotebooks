[underline]5 grs Metallic pallad[superscript]m[/superscript].[/underline] dissolved in pure Nit. Mur[superscript]e[/superscript].
precip[superscript]d[/superscript]. by lime water when nearly neutral. -
- well washed - of a deep brown colour
- dried for some hours in a platina Crucible
on Sandbath - then just below redness
weighed 5 1/8 1/16 1/32 grs, & approached a blk colour. -
The loss on the filter probably equalled what
would make it 5 1/2 grs which would give
90 pallad[superscript]m[/superscript]. & 10 oxy[superscript]e[/superscript]. - -
But little confidence can be placed in a
single exp[superscript]t[/superscript],, of this kind. & where the quantity operated
on was so small.  -
10 grs fine gold dissolved in Nit. Mur[superscript]c[/superscript]. - precip[superscript]d[/superscript].
when nearly neutral by pure pot. At first
precip[superscript]e[/superscript]. yellow - but after some hours though kept
in the dark, it became of a dull purple.
The precip[superscript]e[/superscript]. carefully washed & dried [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] weighed
only 8/16 of a grain. - On evaporating to dryness
more of the gold was obtained. Potash would
not produce any further precip[superscript]e[/superscript]. - Seems to form
a triple salt with oxide of Gold. -
