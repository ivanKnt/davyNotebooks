         <p>Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulphur and metals, but
            also as a pure elemental crystal. Arsenic is a metalloid.</p>

         <p>Symbol/formula: K</p>
         
         <p>A silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife. Potassium metal
            reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only
            seconds of exposure.</p>

         <p>Now known as oxygen. Oxygen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas essential to

         <p>An alkaline substance consisting largely of impure potassium carbonate. In October
            1807, Davy decomposed potash using electricity, revealing the previously unknown element
            potassium.</p>

         <p>Symbol/formula: N2O</p>
         
         <p>Later known as 'laughing gas'. Davy discovered that nitrous oxide was respirable when
            not contaminated with nitric oxide (NO). Davy researched into the physiological effects
            of nitrous oxide.</p>
