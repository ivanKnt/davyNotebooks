         <h2>Potash</h2>
         
         
         <p>An alkaline substance consisting largely of impure potassium carbonate. In October
            1807, Davy decomposed potash using electricity, revealing the previously unknown element
            potassium.</p>

         <h2>Aqueous vapour</h2>
         
         
         <p>Also known as water vapour; the gaseous phase of water which can be produced from
            the evaporation or boiling of water as a liquid, or from the sublimation of ice. Water
            vapour is invisible to the eye due to its gaseous form. </p>

         <p>Also known as quicksilver. A heavy, silvery element, mercury is the only metallic

         <p>Now known as hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest element and, at standard conditions,
            is a gas of diatomic molecules. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-toxic,
            and highly combustible.</p>
