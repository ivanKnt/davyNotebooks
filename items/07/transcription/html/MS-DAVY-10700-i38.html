            he determined the density of the earth and discovered what would later be named hydrogen.
            He was one of the people who helped appoint Davy to the Royal Institution. Following
            his death in 1810 Davy delivered a widely-quoted eulogy on Cavendish and later arranged
            for some of his apparatus to be transferred to the Royal Institution. FRSL. </p>
