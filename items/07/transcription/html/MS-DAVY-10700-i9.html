         <p>From 1812 Davy used Faraday as his amanuensis and the following year secured his appointment
            as laboratory assistant at the Royal Institution. Despite a difficult relationship
            with Davy, Faraday later became the dominent figure at the Royal Institution and one
            of the leading scientific personalities of the middle third of the nineteenth century.
