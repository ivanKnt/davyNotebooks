These two Volumes contain the ex-
perimental notes made in the Laboratory of the
Royal Institution from October 1805 to October 1812.
during which time Sir H. Davy was Professor of
Chemistry - After I knew Sir H. Davy he occasionally
tore away leaves upon which notes had been written
that he might carry the data home for consideration
but I presume that during the time he resided in
the House of the Institution there would be no induc- 
ment to do so and that these two volumes have been
but little injured in that way - For their future
security I have this day paged the leaves regularly.
There are 691 pages in this volume and 265 in the
other not one of which is wanting.

Experiments to ascertain whether potass..[superscript]m[/superscript] could
be procured or potash decomposed. -
1. Acet.[superscript]e[/superscript] of Potash & white oxide of Antimony
(in the proportion of 2 parts of former to 1
of latter) were mixed, & heated strongly in
a glazed earthen retort. - Abundance of
gas was evolved. - Some of the sublimed
antimony coated the lower extremity of the retort
& a blackish mass remained at the bottom - but
there was no appearance of any potass.[superscript]m[/superscript] nor
[deletion][unclear]my[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]any[/insertion] indication that potash had been decomposed. -
2. Acet[/superscript]e[/superscript]. Potash & oxide of Zinc with a little
zinc filings. (about equal quantities) were
strongly heated in a glazed earthen retort
gas was copiously liberated. - The Zinc was
sublimed. But there were no indications
of potash being decomposed. -
3. Acet[superscript]e[/superscript],, Potash & white oxide of Arsenic
(about equal parts) heated intensely. -
a vast quantity of a most offensive gas having
the smell of garlic: [insertion]( arsenica[superscript]d[/superscript] hydro[superscript]e[/superscript][insertion] [insertion]was evolved[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] It was very dense & the

[page]12||dnp07002pp|68871939[/page]
fumes were of a reddish brown [insertion]& white[/insertion] colour. -
In the neck of the retort there were some beautiful
pieces of crystallised arsenic - but they did not contain
any potass[superscript]m[/superscript]. - A little below there was a quantity
of a soft black substance coating the surface. - When
heated dense white fumes exhaled & It almost wholly
burnt away [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] It is conceived to be a compound
of charcoal & arsenic. - A minute quantity of
pyrosphorus was also formed which was observed to inflame
when exposed to the atmosphere
[underline]Examination of the gas from this last exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/underline]
4 of the gas & 5 of oxygene when mixed together
produced white fumes, by passing the spark through
a violent [deletion]diminution[/deletion] inflammation took place.
& the diminution was to 5 3/4, 2 3/4 more of [deletion]oxygen[/deletion][insertion]gas[/insertion]
being added white fumes were again produced, but
did not inflame -

when mixed together white fumes as before, & more
diminished by agitation to 9 1/3, the electric spark

August 19. An exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. to procure the [unclear]carbaret[/unclear]
of Sulpher of Clement & Devormes -
[Horizontal rule]
Pieces of roll sulphur were placed [deletion]at[/deletion]in the bottom
part of an earthen tube luted, the part which was
over the fire contained well burnt charcoal coarsely
powdered, the mouth of the tube entered a glass
[deletion]baloon[/deletion] vessel which was connected by a small
tube with the penumatic apparatus -
When the middle of the tube in which the charcoal
lay was red hot, the red cloth which protected the
end from heat was taken off & the sulphur allowed
to flow gradually over, not stopping till the charcoal
ceased to emit gas, as soon as white fumes appeared
in the intermediate receiver, a jar caught the gas
that came over, which notwithstanding the receiver
was kept as cool as possible by water, were cloudy
in a slight degree - The white fumes passed from the
tube into the receiver like a stream of water, falling
from the mouth at once to the bottom & immediately
condensing into the liquid carburet - When gas ceased to
come over, no more liquid was produced. The gas
preserved for examination was caught at different
periods of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] N.[superscript]o[/superscript] 1 - The first gas that

[page]14||dnp07004pp|68871941[/page]

Note. The charcoal used in this exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] had been three
times before [deletion][unclear]been[/unclear][/deletion] employed for the same purpose.
& with similar success each time - The water through
which the gas passed into the jar, soon acquired a brown

An exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] made for the purpose of [deletion]exam[/deletion] preserving
the gas produced during the production of the
Carburet of Sulphur for examination -
An earthen tube similar to the last used, was
charged with sulphur & charcoal as before, part
of the sulphur had been employed in the last exp[superscript]t[/superscript].
& the additional had been [insertion]first[/insertion] heated till brought into
fusion at the edges - The charcoal had been used
in four preceding exp[superscript]ts[/superscript].- The tube was connected
by a small glass one with the pneumatic apparatus
& made perfectly air tight - When it was red hot
at the bottom, the gas which before had been allowed
to escape, appeared with white fumes, it was then
received, the heat was gradually raised both under
that part containing the charcoal & that, the sulp
hur, till it could not well be increased by a

The gas was divided into 6 portions, the bulk of each was
marked when received, together it amounted [space left for figure] cubical

Should Tellurium [underline]really[/underline] possess a
strong attraction for Hydrogene
it will be the most valuable
discovery of a reagent perhaps ever
made - It will lead to
test facts of the Phlogistic & antiphlogistic
Theories -
Why cannot fused oxides be
revived by - pole?
Will tellurium - revive other
[underline]metallic solutions[/underline].- -
Will solutions of tellurium
be revived by other metals - will

was covered with a brownish black
sublimate - There was a small increase
of gas - The tube was filled with mercury
& strong muriatic acid gas being added
produced 1 & nearly 1/10 of a cubic inch

was gently heated, a brilliant globule of
Potassium issued out from beneath the surface
of Potash, it remained only for a short time
bright & of it's proper colour, the uppermost
surface that was not in contact with glass
soon became black, gradually acquiring this
colour - The whole of the potassium just as
the first globule was converted burst

cool by water - The mercury immedi
ately began to fall it continued
falling till it had reached 19 on
the receiver, a strong white heat which
the barrel was exposed to for some
minutes did not cause the mercury
to descend further - The fire was
removed & the tube cooled the

After the Boracic acid was reduced
to the state of a glass, it was kept
in a white heat, till it no long er
contained air bubbles - and in order
to insure the total dissipation of it's
water it was again intensely heated ,
but during this operation a few grains
of charcoal fell into the fused acid,
& though red hot & covered with the
acid, yet they gave off gas till entire
ly consumed -
The Iron filings were kept in a
red heat for more than a quarter of
an hour in an earthen crucible covered.
They weighed 680 grs , they were placed
in the Iron gun barrel luted & conn
ected by a glass tube with mercury
& the whole was made air tight -
The barrel was heated nearly to
whiteness, a few bubbles of common air
were alone expelled from the tube -
100 grs of the fused boracic acid
were added , in pieces , still warm - The

in an Iron barrel luted & [deletion]around[/deletion] 900 grs
of Iron filings which had been previously
heated to redness were added - The
barrel was connected with a pneu-

glass tube & to prevent the admission
of aqueous vapour the extremity
of the tube was plunged into a
cup of mercury under water -
The whole apparatus being found
tight, the tube was brought to
a dull red heat when inflammable
gas was rapidly evolved, this soon
became a bright red heat, which
was continued for an hour, during
which time about 53 cubic inches
of Hydrogene were produced, towards
the end, the gas came over gradually
slower & at the end it had ceased -
The bellows was then blown, & a
strong white heat was kept up
for about half an hour, when the
gas that the increase of heat
produced, ceased to be evolved
& a rapid absorption, rendered it
necessary to stop the operation &
close the mouth of the tube -
11 cubic inches of Hydrogene were
procured -

Hence it appears that N.[superscript]o[/superscript] 1. contains
green sulphat of Iron. & owes it's yellowish
colour to a little red oxide suspended
which gives the light shade of green
to the white precipitate by prussiat

it follows, that the Iron becomes more
highly oxyginated, part of the oxide therefore
falls down - Ammonia occasions with this

again added, the colour of the precipitate
is now of a reddish brown colour -

[underline]on the action of Potassium on fused Potash[/underline]

crucible till the cessation of effervescence
indicated the dissipation of water foreign
to its composition - Whilst in fusion at
a heat below that of redness. Potassium
filling a small platina cup was
immersed [insertion]in[/insertion] it - immediately a violent
effervescence was produced which gradually
diminished till it had entirely ceased .
the cup on examination using water
was found to contain only Potash -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated several
times with fresh portions of Potassium
in the same cup - the results
differed only in the degree of the
effervescence - as the quantity of Potassium
used increased, the action was apparently
proportionably less - the Potash became
more difficult of fusion - & at the same
time became of a denser colour. till at
last it was nearly black - the colour
seemed to be occasioned by the presence
of [deletion]char[/deletion] carbon derived from the carbonic
acid, absorbed by the potash & decomposed
by the Potassium -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated several

Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. in the triple compound of oxymur-
iatic acid. Phosphorus & ammonia
[Horizontal rule]
To make the compound of oxymuriatic
acid & Phosphorous, a small piece of
Phosphorus was placed in a retort -
When the retort was filled with
oxymuriatic acid gas, the phosphorus
took fire & burnt with a bright
white light, till entirely consumed -
The product was a very fine
white sublimate, which rose in
vapour at a heat apparently below
that of boiling water - When the bellows
was blown into the retort to
expel the remaining oxymuriatic
acid, muriatic acid gas was
formed in great abundance & the
sublimate appeared to afford it - for
the sublimate diminished very fast -
Note - A very minute quantity of
a white fluid was formed by the
action of the oxymuriatic acid gas
on the Phosphorus -
This exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated, no fluid
product obtained, the white sublimate
the same as before -
The retort containing the white
sublimate was exhausted by means
of the air pump - ammoniacal gas
was admitted into it from a receiver -
a combination immediately took place

[page]225||dnp07213pp|68872186[/page]
213
copious dense white vapours arose &
filled the retort - The receiver was
thrice filled with ammonia & almost
the whole of this combined with the
white sublimate with about 1 grain of
Phosphorus - When no more ammonia
was absorbed, a spirit lamp was
applied to the bulb of the retort - a
fresh sublimate was formed in the neck
of the retort, which was very crystallized -
The retort was heated by a charcoal
fire, till it began to soften - The
white compound remained fixed at med Leake
a red heat -
The retort was broken & the
white matter was collected - It had
the appearance of oxide of Zinc - It
was perfectly insipid - not altered by
exposure to the air - not acted on by water
When heated on a plate of glass white
vapours in great plenty arose having the
appearance of muriat of ammonia - they
appeared to be neutral, they had no smell
of acid or alkali - When the volatile
part was driven off, there remained
a large proportion of white matter fixed -
This substance remained unaltered in
boiling nitric & muriatic acid, it
was not dissolved in a strong boiling
solution of Potash - It bore a bright
red heat in a close green glass
tube, without volatilizing - Heated to
redness in a small platina [deletion][unclear]tube[/unclear][/deletion] vessel, a
white vapour appeared, & a small globule

[page]226||dnp07214pp|68872187[/page]
like phosphoric glass remained - The
peculiar fixed compound acted by
strong Sulphuric acid evolved a
smell of muriatic acid gas - The
action was very weak even at
the boiling temperature of the acid -
When the peculiar substance was thrown
into fused Potash, violent action was
produced, accompanied by ignition at
the surface - The smell of ammonia
was produced - the compound of the
fixed alkali was dissolved by
water, when neutralized, no precipi-
tate was occasioned -
The same changes took place
apparently when the peculiar
substance was acted on, in the
midst of the fused potash in a
platina cone -
It appeared to be nearly of the
spe: gravity of strong sulphuric acid
for when first thrown into this fluid
it did not sink, but when agitated
it remained nearly at rest at different
depths. - .
It appeared to burn when exposed on
a thin metallic plate to the flame of a spirit
lamp - a globule of glass remained -
When heated in a small green glass tube
with Potassium, the metal inflamed - the changes
[deletion]of it were[/deletion] produced were not very
clear - thrown into water gas was

[page]227||dnp07215pp|68872188[/page]

generated that had the smell of Phosphuretted
hydrogene -
This exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated - when the tube was
broken, the enclosed substance inflamed -
burnt vividly - produced slight explosions
like phosphuretted H. - glowed like
pyrophorous -
Again repeated the tube terminating
in mercury, some gas was produced
if the gas before in the receiver
was pure ammonia, no ammonia
was generated - The ammonia
being separated by water the
residual gas inflamed on [deletion]the[/deletion]
applying a lighted taper. - -
The crystallized sublimate which
arose on heating the compound in
the retort, had the saline taste
of muriat of ammonia. -
Previous to these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. the effects
of the Liquor of Libavius [deletion][unclear]had[/unclear][/deletion] on ammonia
had been tried -
A small quantity of the liquor was
admitted into a glass tube full of mercury
in mercury - the first portion of ammonia -
cal gas which was thrown up, was quite
pure - a combination immediately took
place, much heat was produced, a white
precipitate was formed - the whole of
the gas was absorbed - a very large
quantity of gas was required to satur-

[page]228||dnp07216pp|68872189[/page]
ate the liquor - the white precipitate
was formed in great abundance - it rose
in vapour at a heat below that of redness
& was entirely dissipated by continuing
the heat - no oxide of Tin was separated.

Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. on Sulphur & Potassium -
A white glass retort was lined with
sulphur by fusing the sulphur in the
bulb - 1.32 cub. in - of dry hydrogene being
admitted. a grain of Potassium pressed out
into a thin plate was added - on heating
[unclear]the[/unclear] retort the combination of the sulphur
& metal produced vivid ignition - The
retort was not injured - when cold the
gas amounted to 1.57 so that there was
.25 generated - The retort was filled
with mercury - muriatic acid saturated
with Sulphuretted hydrogene was added -
next morning 1 1/10 of gas was produced
& the sulphuret appeared decomposed - This
gas consisted of 1.02 of suphuretted
hydrogene & of .08 of hydrogene - the former
quantity was absorbed by water - the latter
inflamed -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated & the [insertion][unclear]1[/unclear] gr of[/insertion] Potassium
being in a round [deletion]lump[/deletion] piece - The heat
produced by the combination was so great
as to break the retort which was of white
glass & much thicker than the retort
first used - The bulb which appeared

[page]229||dnp07217pp|68872190[/page]
217
to contain all the sulphuret, was imme
diately plunged under mercury till a
jar with muriatic acid saturated with
sulphuretted hydrogene could be had - When
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] bulb was cold it was filled with
mercury & thrown into the acid - in
the morning about .85 of gas were
produced - this composition of this gas
was not ascertained, as the sulphuretted

was impure - When the bulb was broken
& thrown into acid a few bubbles of gas
were produced -

fused muriat of lime, was exhausted
& filled with oxymuriatic - The
retort was then connected with a
receiver containing 25 of dry & pure
ammonia - The stop-cocks being turned
an immediate absorption of the am
monia took place - dense white fumes
were produced & so much heat was
evolved that the cement about the
stopcock melted - The whole 25 of am-
were absorbed, 8 more of am. were
also absorbed (25 + 8 = 33) when the

1 cubic inch of pure ammoniacal
gas & 1 of carbonic gas containing 1/27 of
common air - diminution to 5/10 of a cubic
inch very nearly .- another cubic inch of
pure ammonia was added - the whole
was absorbed except about 1/27 of a cubic
inch - not quite so much as that rather
1/30.-
1 cubic inch of muriatic acid gas
containing 1/10 of common air was next added
there was an absorption of 4/10 - The
residue of 1/30 had been previously thrown
out of the receiver.-
1 cubic inch more of muriatic gas

[page]436||dnp07424pp|68872414[/page]
was added - there was a fresh
absorption of 4/10 of a cub. in - The
residual gas therefore = 1.2 cub. in
When transferred to Water there was
an immediate absorption of 2/10 of a
cub. inch.-
The residual gas consisted of 8/10 of
carbonic acid gas & 2/10 of inflammable
gas.-
1 cubic inch of muriatic gas (the
same kind that as that before used) was
thrown up into a jar over mercury
containing about 5 grs of the neutral
carbonat of Ammonia formed by
exposing the common sub-carbonat to
the atmosphere.- The carbonat was
in a small glass tube.-
In about 10 minutes there was an
absorption of 1/10 of a cubic inch.-
When the gas was transferred to Water
there was an immediate absorption
of 2/10 .- agitated with a solution of
potash 6/10 were absorbed, the residue
= 1/10 was Hydrogene.-

gas similar to the last was added
to about 3 grs of the neutral

on transferring it to Water - there was

[page]437||dnp07425pp|68872415[/page]

an immediate absorption of about 1/20

32 measures more of gas were

The muriatic acid after
the decomposition of the carbonat

very slight fumes were perceived, but
no heat.-
as much as possible of the salt

This liquor gives a copious

Nitrat of Silver added after the

Barytic water gives a copious
precipitate - Sulphat of Potash gives
a copious white heavy precipitate. -
Hence this liquor appears to
contain muriatic acid, Sulphuric acid,
oxide of Arsenic & Lead -
2 oz measures during evaporation to
dryness gave off acid fumes in
great abundance which appeared to
be muriatic - the temperature
was not sufficiently high to
[unclear]volatilize[/unclear] oxide of arsenic. -
When evaporated nearly to dryness
the fumes appeared to [insertion]be[/insertion] sulphuric

The temperature being raised a little
more sulphuric acid fumes were produced
The residue perfectly dry to the
touch would have given off more
acid fumes if the heat was increased
but that would have volatilized the
arsenic - it's colour was brownish white
it weighed 257 grs - it was
digested finely pounded in 2 oz measures

latter in small quantity & Sulphureous
