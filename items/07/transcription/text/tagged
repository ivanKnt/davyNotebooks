[misc]misc_134|These two Volumes contain[/misc] the ex-
perimental notes made in the Laboratory of the
Royal Institution from October 1805 to October 1812.
during which time Sir H. Davy was Professor of
Chemistry - After I knew Sir H. Davy he occasionally
tore away leaves upon which notes had been written
that he might carry the data home for consideration
but I presume that during the time he resided in
the House of the Institution there would be no induc-
ment to do so and that these two volumes have been
but little injured in that way - For their future
security I have this day paged the leaves regularly.
There are 691 pages in this volume and 265 in the
other not one of which is wanting.

Pieces of roll [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] were placed [deletion]at[/deletion]in the bottom
part of an earthen tube luted, the part which was
over the fire contained well burnt [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] coarsely
powdered, the mouth of the tube entered a glass
[deletion]baloon[/deletion] vessel which was connected by a small
tube with the penumatic apparatus -
When the middle of the tube in which the [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical]
lay was red hot, the red cloth which protected the
end from heat was taken off & the [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] allowed
to flow gradually over, not stopping till the [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical]
ceased to emit gas, as soon as white fumes appeared
in the intermediate receiver, a jar caught the gas
that came over, which notwithstanding the receiver
was kept as cool as possible by water, were cloudy
in a slight degree - The white fumes passed from the
tube into the receiver like a stream of water, falling
from the mouth at once to the bottom & immediately
condensing into the liquid carburet - When gas ceased to
come over, no more liquid was produced. The gas
preserved for examination was caught at different
periods of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] N.[superscript]o[/superscript] 1 - The first gas that

by a small glass one with the pneumatic apparatus
& made perfectly air tight - When it was red hot

When the compound was introduced to water
inflammation occurred, owing probably to the

The gas was slowly evolved from the compound
& when a sufficient quantity was collected
it was examined by pure [chemical]chemical_026|oxymur[superscript]c[/superscript]. acid[/chemical] gas,
white fumes were observed but no brown

the revival of the Potassium -
- There was a larger absorption
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] certainly more than
12 cubical inches - The [chemical]chemical_070|copper[/chemical]
tube for distillation was quite
clean - newly [underline]bored[/underline]; - It
was filled with : [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]; but
as its capacity was only 2 1/2 the

have amounted to rather more than
5/8 [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] of a cubical inch - -
Not 14 cubical inches of gas

An exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] to ascertain whether sulphat of [chemical]chemical_042|barytes[/chemical]
is decomposable by Pure [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] -
A small quantity of Native Sulphat of [chemical]chemical_042|barytes[/chemical]
reduced to the finest powder was placed in a
glass tube with more than its weight of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical]
& sufficient distilled water to dissolve the
alkali was added. & the air being rarefied
by boiling for a short time the solution, the
open end of the tube was hermetically sealed.
It was placed on the sand bath & digested
at a temperature below it's boiling point for
a week -
The purity of the [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] used was ascertained
by dissolving a small fragment of the piece, in
pure water & adding Acetat of [chemical]chemical_042|barytes[/chemical]. - No
turbidness was produced -
After the digestion [deletion]the tube was opene[/deletion]
the top of the tube was cut off, the liquor
filtered & neutralized by [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] (which
was first found to contain no [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical]
Acetat of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] added gave no indication
of any of the Sulphat being decomposed - A very
slight cloudiness was produced, such as might
be expected to have been extracted from the

The retort was filled with [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical],
the phosphuret a small quantity of
[chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] being added was
immediately decomposed, 8/10 of a cubic

1 3/10 gr of Potassium was heated in
about a cubic inch of Phosphuretted
[chemical]chemical_007|hydrogen[/chemical] - The phosphuret was formed
as in the preceeding operation, when
the retort which was of green glass
was cold, a considerable absorption
of gas appeared to have taken place,
by gently heating again the bulb of
the retort where the metal was,
the absorption continued, the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]

The volume of gas was increased about
2/10 of a cubic inch, it did not inflame in
the air -
The gas afforded by the Phosphuret
by the action of strong [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical]
was about 1/10 of a cubic inch, it did
inflame spontaneously in the air -
7/10 of Potassium were heated in [deletion][unclear]two[/unclear][/deletion] 2

white cloudes were perceived issuing from
the bulb of the retort down the neck -
The volume of gas was increased by
2/10 of a cubic inch, it was not spontaneously
inflammable in the air -
The Phosphuret gave off by the action of
strong [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] 6/10 of gas; that did

high as a dull red, it was continued for about
1/2 hour, the interior of the bulb of the retort
which was of green glass gradually blackened
& became at last so dark as to be opaque
a little grey powder, sublimed, from it's
appearance it was not easy to determine
whether it was merely Potassium in a fine
state of division, or the metal with [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]

ption had reached so far, the retort was
again heated, but further diminution
was produced -
The tube was removed to the water
apparatus, by the action of Water, the
Potassium afforded .75 of a cubic inch
of gas, which inflamed & burnt with
a beautiful green light, similar
in colour to spirits of wine containing

1 grain of Potassium was admitted into
a small green glass retort containing a
known quantity of silicated [unclear][deletion]fluor[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_238|Boracic[/chemical][/unclear] acid.
No absorption of the gas took place [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] before
heat was applied. When the bulb of the retort
was gently heated, a brilliant globule of
Potassium issued out from beneath the surface
of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical], it remained only for a short time
bright & of it's proper colour, the uppermost
surface that was not in contact with glass
soon became black, gradually acquiring this
colour - The whole of the potassium just as
the first globule was converted burst
into a vivid flame, an absorption of
the gas was produced. The residual
gas transferred contained about 1
cubic inch of gas not absorbed by
water -

After the [chemical]chemical_041|boracic acid[/chemical] was reduced
to the state of a glass, it was kept
in a white heat, till it no long er

The barrel was heated nearly to
whiteness, a few bubbles of [chemical]chemical_254|common air[/chemical]
were alone expelled from the tube -
100 grs of the fused [chemical]chemical_041|boracic acid[/chemical]

produced, ceased to be evolved
& a rapid absorption, rendered it

[underline]on the action of Potassium on fused [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical][/underline]
Some pure [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] was fused in a silver
crucible till the cessation of effervescence
indicated the dissipation of water foreign
to its composition - Whilst in fusion at
a heat below that of redness. Potassium
filling a small [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical] cup was
immersed [insertion]in[/insertion] it - immediately a violent
effervescence was produced which gradually
diminished till it had entirely ceased .
the cup on examination using water
was found to contain only [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was repeated several
times with fresh portions of Potassium
in the same cup - the results
differed only in the degree of the
effervescence - as the quantity of Potassium
used increased, the action was apparently
proportionably less - the [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] became
more difficult of fusion - & at the same
time became of a denser colour. till at
last it was nearly black - the colour
seemed to be occasioned by the presence
of [deletion]char[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_054|Carbon[/chemical] derived from the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical], absorbed by the [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] & decomposed

Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. in the triple compound of oxymur-
iatic acid. [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
[Horizontal rule]
To make the compound of oxymuriatic
acid & [chemical]chemical_151|Phosphorous[/chemical], a small piece of
[chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] was placed in a retort -
When the retort was filled with
[chemical]chemical_026|oxymuriatic acid[/chemical] gas, the [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical]
took fire & burnt with a bright
white light, till entirely consumed -
The product was a very fine
white sublimate, which rose in
vapour at a heat apparently below
that of boiling water - When the bellows
was blown into the retort to
expel the remaining oxymuriatic
acid, [chemical]chemical_016|muriatic acid gas[/chemical] was
formed in great abundance & the
sublimate appeared to afford it - for
the sublimate diminished very fast -
Note - A very minute quantity of
a white fluid was formed by the
action of the [chemical]chemical_026|oxymuriatic acid[/chemical] gas
on the [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] -
This exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated, no fluid
product obtained, the white sublimate
the same as before -
The retort containing the white
sublimate was exhausted by means
of [misc]misc_220|the air pump[/misc] - [chemical]chemical_003|ammoniacal gas[/chemical]
was admitted into it from a receiver -
a combination immediately took place

[page]225|MS-DAVY-10700-000-00225|dnp07213pp|68872186[/page]
213
copious dense white vapours arose &
filled the retort - The receiver was
thrice filled with [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] & almost
the whole of this combined with the
white sublimate with about 1 grain of
[chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] - When no more [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
was absorbed, a [misc]misc_362|spirit lamp[/misc] was
applied to the bulb of the retort - a
fresh sublimate was formed in the neck
of the retort, which was very crystallized -
The retort was heated by a [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical]
fire, till it began to soften - The
white compound remained fixed at med Leake
a red heat -
The retort was broken & the
white matter was collected - It had
the appearance of oxide of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] - It
was perfectly insipid - not altered by
exposure to the air - not acted on by water
When heated on a plate of glass white
vapours in great plenty arose having the
appearance of muriat of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] - they
appeared to be neutral, they had no smell
of acid or alkali - When the volatile
part was driven off, there remained
a large proportion of white matter fixed -
This substance remained unaltered in
boiling nitric & [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical], it
was not dissolved in a strong boiling
solution of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] - It bore a bright
red heat in a close green glass
tube, without volatilizing - Heated to
redness in a small [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical] [deletion][unclear]tube[/unclear][/deletion] vessel, a
white vapour appeared, & a small globule

[page]226|MS-DAVY-10700-000-00226|dnp07214pp|68872187[/page]
like phosphoric glass remained - The
peculiar fixed compound acted by
strong [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] evolved a
smell of [chemical]chemical_016|muriatic acid gas[/chemical] - The
action was very weak even at
the boiling temperature of the acid -
When the peculiar substance was thrown
into fused [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical], violent action was
produced, accompanied by ignition at
the surface - The smell of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
was produced - the compound of the
fixed alkali was dissolved by
water, when neutralized, no precipi-
tate was occasioned -
The same changes took place
apparently when the peculiar
substance was acted on, in the
midst of the fused [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] in a
[chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical] cone -
It appeared to be nearly of the
spe: gravity of strong [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical]
for when first thrown into this fluid
it did not sink, but when agitated
it remained nearly at rest at different
depths. - .
It appeared to burn when exposed on
a thin metallic plate to the flame of a spirit
lamp - a globule of glass remained -
When heated in a small green glass tube
with Potassium, the metal inflamed - the changes
[deletion]of it were[/deletion] produced were not very
clear - thrown into water gas was

[page]227|MS-DAVY-10700-000-00227|dnp07215pp|68872188[/page]

generated that had the smell of Phosphuretted
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] -
This exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated - when the tube was
broken, the enclosed substance inflamed -
burnt vividly - produced slight explosions
like phosphuretted H. - glowed like
pyrophorous -
Again repeated the tube terminating
in [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical], some gas was produced
if the gas before in the receiver
was pure [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], no [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
was generated - The [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
being separated by water the
residual gas inflamed on [deletion]the[/deletion]
applying a lighted taper. - -
The crystallized sublimate which
arose on heating the compound in
the retort, had the [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] taste
of muriat of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]. -
Previous to these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. the effects
of the Liquor of [person]person_370|Libavius[/person] [deletion][unclear]had[/unclear][/deletion] on [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
had been tried -
A small quantity of the liquor was
admitted into a glass tube full of [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
in [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] - the first portion of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] -
cal gas which was thrown up, was quite
pure - a combination immediately took
place, much heat was produced, a white
precipitate was formed - the whole of
the gas was absorbed - a very large
quantity of gas was required to satur-

ate the liquor - the white precipitate
was formed in great abundance - it rose
in vapour at a heat below that of redness
& was entirely dissipated by continuing
the heat - no oxide of [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical] was separated.
