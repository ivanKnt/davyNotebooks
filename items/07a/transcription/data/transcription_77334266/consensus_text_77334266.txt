in 2 hours equal parts of NG & the air [insertion]4 parts cool[/insertion] in Hydrogene bottle
became 6.3
with the other bottle equal parts [insertion]became[/insertion] 5.7.
Hydrogen & silcated [unclear]fluorine[/unclear] gas stood two hours as before Hy
above 44 parts from the Hy bottle became over water. 40 pts
which burn like hydrogene - 30 parts from sil flu the bottle
