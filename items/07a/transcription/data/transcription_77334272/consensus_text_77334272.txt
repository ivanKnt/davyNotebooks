Is not the air in different states of condensation. throughout the whole of the long tube
and if so what ratio of [unclear]effect[/unclear] ought to [unclear]amm[/unclear] and how will that tend to ac-

Query the effect of flame [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] [unclear]applied[/unclear] to the end

Query the difference in the passage of different gases at high & low
pressures _ It is very great. (see next leaf)
