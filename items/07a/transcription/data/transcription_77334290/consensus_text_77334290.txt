100 grs. macerated in water gave 34.5.gr insoluble
matter the solution evaporated to dryness & treated with alcohol
contained no sugar but appeared to be British gum.

When chromic acid is heated in Muriatic acid it gives out
oxygen before the solution becomes blue and a muriate of chrome is formed
[deletion]this is formed[/deletion] the formation of the muriate is formed by evaporating to dryness [unclear]at[/unclear]
a heat sufficient to drive off all the muriatic acid & water - a [unclear]dark brown[/unclear] or
[insertion]green ish[/insertion] substance is left. It is a chloride of chrome is insoluble in water giving
the green muriate had in the former case but now almost neutral
NB. The oxygen that is given out decomposes a portion of the Mur Acid so that much
chlorine escapes
By boiling carbonate of ammonia with chromate of lead
both are decomposed & a solution is obtained containing carbonate & chromate
of ammonia by evaporation in a carefull manner the whole of the
carbonate of ammonia is driven off & the chromate is obtained pure
Boracic acid dissolves the borate of silver
Carbonate of potash dissolves chromate of lead _ So also
does the carbonate of soda _ on converting the carbonates into nitrates this
chromate of lead is thrown down & it is not in very considerable quantity

When Boracic acid is boiled on a sufficient quantity of oxide of
silver [unclear](most)[/unclear] the acid is neutralised and a borate of silver is obtained which
being more soluble in hot water than in cold may be obtained in [unclear]fine prismatic[/unclear]
