crystals [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] from a centre by cooling a hot saturated solution
of it
The precipitate thrown down by adding a neutral solution of
borate of soda to nitrate of silver is as sub-borate _ It is not soluble in
water but when heated in it is decomposed - neutral borate of silver
is formed & remains in solution & much brown oxide is separated
- Sulphurous acid in solution is precipitated by
nitrate of silver but not by [unclear]not[/unclear] or muriate of barytes _ the sul
phate of silver falls down as a heavy white curd but is resoluble in
excess of the acid
Chrome is the only metal I remember that in its com-
bination with oxygen forms neutral salts both with acids & alkalis - [unclear]its xxxx &[/unclear]
oxide possesses this power.
The best method of separating[unclear]oxyiodine[/unclear] from [unclear]chloriodine[/unclear] after having
found the two together by [unclear]euchlorine[/unclear] & iodine is to expose the flasks containing
them to a free air both bodies deliquesce the chloride most readily and the
latter flies off whilst the whole of the [unclear]oxyedine[/unclear] remains in the flask & by
evaporation is obtained in its solid form
Flux for Galena 2 of flux to 1 of [unclear]sulphurate[/unclear]

Lime - 1.5
Salt - 2.
Iron filings -[underline] 15.[/underline]
Borate of Silver may be fused without [unclear]suffering[/unclear]
decomposition it is converted into a light yellow enamel which
[unclear]is not[/unclear] affected by the highest heat of a spirit lamp & blow pipe &
which is resoluble in water as at first.
