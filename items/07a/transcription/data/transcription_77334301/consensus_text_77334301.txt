Sol of ammonia dissolves with heat much more white arsenic
than water does but on cooling [deletion]almost[/deletion] the whole of the arsenic is thrown down
though the liquor be strongly alkaline Ammonia therefore when the affinities are
increases by temperature does [deletion]export[/deletion] evince a degree of chemical attraction for arsenic
independant of that of its water but at low temperatures this power is almost lost &
gives way to attraction of cohesion
- [unclear]Chloriodine[/unclear] added to potash is decomposed the chlorine combines
with the alkali liberating the iodine in [unclear]solid form[/unclear] it [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]combines with other portion
of the alkali but more slowly the resulting bodies are [unclear]combinate[/unclear] of chlorine & iodine
with potassium & [unclear]chlorine[/unclear] & iodine each with oxygen & potassium
- Will chromic acid combine with the oxide of chrome so as
to form a neutral & well defined salt?
- Muriate of chromium is no test for [unclear]Lead[/unclear] the chromium
being only in the state of oxide
 Muriate of chromium is precipitate green (dusky) by [unclear]sulphate[/unclear]
of ammonia - blue by precipitate of potash [insertion]resoluble in [unclear]excess of precipitate[/unclear][/insertion] - [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] by tincture of galls
-- green by ammonia -- lighter green by carbonate of ammonia --
Hydriodate of potash pea green - Hydroidic acid greenish yellow --
not precipitated by chromate of potash
Chromate of potash does not precipitate [unclear]sulphuret[/unclear] of ammonia
nor [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] of potash - nor tincture of galls - ammonia - or carb of ammonia
nor by iodine of its compounds
- Muriate of chromium very soluble - of a fine green colour
slightly reddens [unclear]littmus[/unclear] but not [unclear]then[/unclear] vegetable blues - evaporated to dryness & heated
becomes chlorid which with water is reconverted into muriate
Sulphate of [unclear]soda[/unclear] added to muriate of chrome thrown down [unclear]a[/unclear]
