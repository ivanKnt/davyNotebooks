green precipitate which appears to be a sub-sulphate of [unclear]chrome[/unclear]
the solution [unclear]filter[/unclear] is of a fine green it contains both sulphuric acid & [unclear]chrome[/unclear]
apparently combined as a sulphate of the metal
The chloride of chromium does not diliquesce (no change in 4 days)

The green oxide of chromium is not [unclear]acted[/unclear] on by the [unclear]sul[/unclear].
nitric or muriatic acid but when fused with caustic alkalis it is
converted into chromic acid producing a chromate
When muriate of chromium is evaporated to dryness & [unclear]heated[/unclear]
to about redness in close tubes the chloride usually is not entirely soluble in
water but a portion remains which when washed & dried is of a dull
dark green colour this appears to be a sub chloride of chromium
This sub chloride when treated with alkali is converted into
an oxide & chlorine may be found in the solution by nit of silver if the heat
 be [unclear]can[/unclear] high the oxide becomes acidifed & then remains in solution but this
causes no ambiguity in the test because of the colour of chromate of silver.
After being heated for a long time in close vessels [unclear]it still[/unclear] with [unclear]treating[/unclear]
by alkali gave abundance of chlorine - but when heated in the open air
chlorine flies off & an oxide remains of a black colour but apparently the
same with the green oxide in this [unclear]trial[/unclear] with alkali is converted into chromic
acid but no traces of chlorine remain in the solution
Oxide of chrome when just precipitate dissolves in small
quanitites in Ammonia giving it a pink colour by evaporation to
remain behind unaltered

Oxide of chrome newly precipitated dissolves in Mur acid the
dried and heated oxide does not
Muriate of chromium is precipitated by chromate of ammonia
