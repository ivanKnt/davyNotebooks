an insoluble pea green precipitate being produced which is not soluble
in most cold water - it is difficult of separation passing readily through the
filter
oxide of chrome newly precipitated dissolves readily in water and the
salt evaporated forms an otherwise [unclear]mass[/unclear] but does not apparently crystallize
if evaporated to dryness it becomes of a brown colour - is resoluble in water forming
a brown solution which on being filtered & thrown down by ammonia gives a
brown precipitate [insertion]this appears to be anoxide in very every respect similar to the green oxide[/insertion] --- if the nitrate be heated still higher it is
decomposed evolving nitrous acid gas & leaving a black [deletion]oxide[/deletion] substance [/insertion] which when treated
with solution of potash [unclear]forms[/unclear] to be chrome acid & oxide the whole being conver-
table into chromic acid by a higher heat -- the ammonia by which the
brown precipitate was thrown down held in solution [unclear]chromic [/unclear]acid - which [unclear]must have[/unclear]
been formed when the nitrate was evaporated to dryness & during its conversion into the [unclear]brown[/unclear]
substance
Muriate of chromium may be formed by treating chromate of ammonia
with mur acid & evaporating to dryness so as to drive off the Mur of ammonia [unclear]if a solution[/unclear]
then be more of the salt a further addition of chromate of ammonia thrown down
chromate of chrome
The oxide dissolves in sul acid [unclear]forming[/unclear] a soluble salt of a green colour
when evaporated to dryness & heated it gives off [unclear]sul acid[/unclear] being the oxide at liberty
Oxide of chrome [unclear]put[/unclear] into chromic acid becomes of a darker [unclear]colour[/unclear]
but is not farther acted on this probably results from the formation of an insoluble [unclear]super[/unclear]
ficial chromate of chrome
The oxide dissolves in acetic & tartaric acid forming an acetate & tartrate of
a brownish green colour - it is most probably soluble in all vegetable acids
