oxide of chromium (green) a decomposition of the salt must therefore have taken
place directly contrary to the effect produced by heating oxide of chromium with
excess of alkali - (Query was not the solution previously slightly acid by nitric acid ?
Oxide of silver [unclear]disolved[/unclear] in ammonia & filtered gives a dark brown
white which when exposed to the air gradually forms on its surface a
reddish brown crystalline body - this body does not undergo alteration in the air
in many hours - if heated it blackens fuzes boils & is converted into pure
silver - if heated on platina it coats it with silver & it is probable [unclear]that the [/unclear]
compound or the [unclear]ammonical[/unclear] solution could be made useful in the arts.

A solution of chloride of chromium nearly neutral as possible was
decomposed first by nitrate of silver & then by ammonia in
the way chloride of silver & oxide of chromium were obtained The
first weighed 2.6 gr the oxide after being dried on the sand bath for
many days 1.3 gr
When the [unclear]ammonuret[/unclear] of silver is evaporated the crystalline substance
that forms on its surface is merely an oxide of silver it does not fume on
being heated but gives out oxygen & is reduced to the metallic state.
As the solution which gave the crystals becomes weaker it
gives other crystals which are white & possess a degree of transparency
& which are essentially different from the first for when heated they
blacken fumes fuse & [unclear]have[/unclear] reduced silver - The solution which gave
these crystals is of a brown colour but very faint ammoniacal odour [unclear]xx xxxx[/unclear]
