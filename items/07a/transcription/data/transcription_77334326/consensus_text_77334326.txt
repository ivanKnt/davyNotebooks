The solutions are both precipitated by potash the recent one

its nature - The solutions probably contain different oxides & it is also
likely that the crystalline oxide solution in the first part of evaporation
is a new oxide of silver - This oxide is of a metallic grey colour by
reflected light but of a bright yellow by transmitted light a drop of

After potash has thrown down all it can from the evaporated
solution it is still of a brown colour & precipitates with mur acid

Oxide of silver & ammonia with excess of oxide were heated together
in a flask oxide was dissolved but the solution was colourless or rather
green in a few moments it exploded it appears that the fulminating silver
is formed by the action of ammonia on undissolved oxide & is probably an [unclear]ammoniat[/unclear] with
