Endeavoured to upset the experiment on a smaller scale & in
open vessels could not succeed with certainty without the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
of free potash & excess of oxide of silver. The portion of silver dissolved
does not appear to form any detonating compound but to effect an
oxide combined with the ammonia - it is probable that the
detonating compound is a combination of metals when with
nitrogen it is perfectly black & in appearance resembles the [unclear]oxide[/unclear]
of nitrogen it appears to regain a pretty high temperature for
In detonation at least sometimes throughout at then it foes off not

having excess of oxide of silver in a mixed solution of ammonia &
potash
