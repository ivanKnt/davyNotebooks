Oct 9[superscript][underline]th[/underline][/superscript] The precipitate also differs from that given by the other ammoniacal
solution it being of a reddish brown & not so copious - sul [unclear]Hydrg[/unclear] throws
 it down like N of S brown. - sol of iodine in water a brown precipitate
[unclear]ends[/unclear] but with N of Silv a yellow turbid precipitate - The precipitate by
potash changes colour with extreme rapidity in the light & quickly forms a
black flocculent substance whilst a portion [unclear]preserved [/unclear]in the dark had its colour
very slightly [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] & fell to the bottom as a fine powder on being placed in
the light it immediately underwent a change. - Nitric acid renders
the solution turbid apparently from a slight impurity - Sul & [unclear]Mur xxxx[/unclear]
throws down sulphat & Mur of silver
The second or evaporated solution precipitated by potash brown -
by subcarb or carb white by soda brown by carb or subcarb white - not by
carb of ammonia - by alcohol white not changing colour & not at all like the
previous solution - by ether white grains are thrown down - with [unclear]prussiate[/unclear]
of potash white - with chromate of ammonia like the other - hydroxide of potash
D[superscript]o[/superscript] - - hydrosulphuret of amm D[superscript]o[/superscript] - - tincture of galls brown as [unclear]xxx[/unclear] before -
sul hydren as the other - sol of iodine D[superscript]o[/superscript] - N M & S acids the same as
before the [unclear]NA[/unclear] with effervescence apparently from CA absorbed by the ammonia
- Lime water throws down an abundant yellow [unclear]precipatte[/unclear] like potash Barytes
very little of a similar appearance
A precipitate obtained by putting together the solution of the first with ether &
alcohol was quite black & when dry detonated in the way of [unclear]fulminate pla
tinum its nature ? its power of detonation pretty strong when first well
dried
Excess of oxide of silver was put in two portions one to amm & the other
 to [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] potash & ammonia after [unclear]study[/unclear] a few hours put in small vessels
