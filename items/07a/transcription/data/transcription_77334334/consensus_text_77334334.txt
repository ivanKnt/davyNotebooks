Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 9 - [unclear]filling[/unclear] paper to day
Oct 10 Both these oxides or powder detonated but not very strongly I
could hardly make these detonate by glass. when dried gradually first they
then detonated more loudly but did not explode until the paper in which they
were held became scorched by the very gradual application of heat
20 grs of the oxide from ammonia that had been drying some
hours on a sand bath were put into a small retort of Glass the whole
together weighd 200,6 grs the oxide was then decomposed by a spirit lamp &
the gas recevd over water a little water rose after decomposition then [unclear]retd[/unclear]
 & water [deletion]might[/deletion] had lost 1.4 gr the retort was then cut & the silver weighed it
equalled 17.5 gr but on weighing the bulb of the retort (96.3) & then cleaning it out with
nitric acid it (95.8) had lost .5 gr making the silver therefore equal 18 gr &
oxygen 275 gr came over equal ,935 grs therefore water to the [unclear]xxx[/unclear] of about 1.005 gr
must have [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] to the oxide The oxygen came [unclear]xxx[/unclear]. cloudy as if from oxy mur of potash

[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] silver [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] by adding excess of oxide to ammonia
is not affected by water the water evaporates by heat of the [unclear]xxxxxx xxxxxxx[/unclear] - it
is dissolved by ammonia & the solution which is of a deep brown colour yields
in evaporation the oxide before noticed - & no fulminating compound remains
Sulphuric acid explodes it
Oxide of silver on being dissolved in ammoniadoes does not give the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
colour immediately it is a pale pink at first & becomes dark brown by
degrees the colour increases during the seperation of the oxide above analyzed & at
 last is very deep the deepest colour is provided by [unclear]dropping[/unclear] [insertion]the[/insertion] [unclear]fulmg compd[/unclear] in ammonia
If the oxide of silver is heated slowly it is [unclear]decmpd without again [/unclear]
change in the form of the crystals or scales but if heated suddenly it
