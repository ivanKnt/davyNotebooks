fuzes first the oxygen is given off with effervescence & the silver
remains in a solid lump. It is probable that under pressure
oxide of silver could be fused without decomposition

40 grs of oxide of silver precipitated by potash & well washed & dried were
distilled in a small glass retort - the whole weight 199.55 gr after decomposition

If then analyses are correct & I have no reason to doubt the general accuracy
the first oxide is a protoxide

It seems that the difference between the two solutions is [unclear]caused[/unclear] by
the presence of Carbonic acid in the last of them. The deposition from the first
is a pure oxide & dissolves in the acids without effervescence that from the last has
a different colour & appearance altogether & effervesces strongly in the [unclear]oxide[/unclear] it [unclear]is also[/unclear]
never deposited until the solution becomes much reduced in quantity [unclear]& strength[/unclear]
