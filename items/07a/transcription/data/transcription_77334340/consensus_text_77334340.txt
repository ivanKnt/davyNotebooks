Alcohol added to solution of silver in ammonia after a time threw down
a black precipitate which deteriorates by heat & [unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] but not easily by
friction - If the solution be filtered [insertion]& heated[/insertion] a stable [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of [unclear]xxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear]takes place which is
black and silver even then remained in solution The second precipitate
was also of a detonating kind but not strongly so
Ether added to the solution threw down a black precipitated [unclear]similar[/unclear]
[unclear]in its obvious[/unclear] character to that by alcohol it could scarcely be said to detonate
by heat - but the precipitate obtained from [unclear]the[/unclear] after solution by heat was
more powerful in this respect
A solute of silver in ammon after having been long exposed to the air &
 also heated so as to throw down much oxide gave a light green solution
[unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] no more oxide of silver but only carbonate on evaporation. It was a
solution of carbonate of silver in sub carb & perhaps pure ammonia When
evaporated it gave of the amm & left carb of silver if [deletion]water[/deletion] ammonia potash
or even water were first added the solution became of an [unclear]intens[/unclear] brown colour
 from the [unclear]decomposite[/unclear] of the carbonate & the solute of the oxide alone in ammonia

A quantity of the first oxide was put into a small glass retort the
whole weighed 167 gr: on being heated it lost in weight 2. grains It was then
cut [unclear]near[/unclear] the silver & the silver & tube weigh = 130.7 gr the tube cleared [unclear]of[/unclear] the
silver & [unclear]clear[/unclear] with nitric acid = 110.55 gr the silver therefore = 20.15 gr Gas [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
to 3.625 [unclear]cubical Inches[/unclear] was received by standing over sol of potash it was [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
to 3 cc equal 1,02 gr of oxygen
