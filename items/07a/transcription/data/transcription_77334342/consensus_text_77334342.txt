It is not easy to make fulminating silver accordg to Berthollets process
([unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] 1) for the results generally are oxide & solutions. I think [unclear]xxx xxxx xxxx[/unclear]
with the common [unclear]moist[/unclear] oxide When made their quantity is so small that it seems rather to
be an accidental product than that produced by the [unclear]xxxxx xxxxx[/unclear] of the affinities the protoxide &
solution of oxide in ammonia seem to be the principal results
I have only in one instance been able to make a [unclear]solid fulminant[/unclear] by heating it
instead of the small crystals [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] by Bethollet I got nothg more than [insertion]a black powder[/insertion] &[deletion]the [unclear]xxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
liberation of azotic gas I am [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] to attribute to the reduction of a peroxide in solution to
the protoxide that is given off by evaporation The black powder when well dried
fulminated only heated but not as strongly as I expected
The best method of making the fulminating silver appears to be to
take oxide of silver it is not of much consequence how prepared or whether carefully [unclear]formed[/unclear] for
the air or [insertion]whether wet or dry[/insertion] & to boil it for a few moments carefully & for a short time in a mixed
solution of potash & ammonia the potash absorbs all carbonic acid & prevents to [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
them [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] the solute of the oxide in the amm a black powder similar to that
[unclear]process[/unclear] in all the other processes results possessing highly detonating powers
The fulminating powder is itself soluble in ammonia

A portion of oxide from the stock bottle was put into ammonia & closed up
from the air after 17 hours it was examined A clear colourless solution was found
at the bottom of which was some unchanged oxide & on that a quantity of a deep
black powder [insertion]not fulminating silver when heated it [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] was decompd with such energy as to become red hot[/insertion] apparently fulminating silver A portion of the solution was taken
& boiled in a tube it gave off azotic gas threw down a black powder ( [underline][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/unclear]strong[/underline] )
& became slightly brown it was filtered white gave off more azote & threw down
more of a black powder ([deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]& slightly detonant[/insertion]) & was much browner again filtered &
boiled it liberated azote & a black powder ([unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] oxide [insertion]not detonate[/insertion]) of [unclear]last[/unclear] colour treated a
fourth time the same phenomenon had place but the liberation of azote was
