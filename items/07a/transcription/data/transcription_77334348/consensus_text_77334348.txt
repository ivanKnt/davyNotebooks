On heating the [insertion]clear[/insertion] solution the first effect was an increase of colour [deletion][unclear]that the[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]formation[/unclear]
of a precipitate constantly [unclear]diminished[/unclear] it & left it of a much less intensity
It seems possible nearly to clear a solution of silver in this way
The colourless solution on being filtered became of a brown colour I am now
clind to attribute this change to the paper - it contained [deletion]a portion of woollen[/deletion]
fibres
I could not make a detonating powder by dissolving the [unclear]first[/unclear] oxide of silver in
ammonia nor by boiling the solution Query will potash
A tube which had been used several times for the boiling of the solution
had become coated internally with the black oxide. On pouring in
dilute nitrous acid it was suddenly lined with a brilliant coating of silver
which was [unclear]xxxxxxx xxxxxxx[/unclear]
Query was not this caused by the decomposition of one part of the oxide to [unclear]fur[/unclear]
[unclear]nish[/unclear] oxygen to the other so as to render it soluble in the acid

When lime water is added to solution of silver in ammonia a
