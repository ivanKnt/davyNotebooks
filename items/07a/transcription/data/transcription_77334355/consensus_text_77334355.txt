A compound of silver & [unclear]phophorus[/unclear] with excess of the latter put into water &
left for many days, at first was sols & [unclear]acted[/unclear] in the water deepening it & [unclear]xxxxx xxxxx[/unclear] and
 hydrogen gas after a [unclear]time [/unclear]expand a flud comp. of sulph. & [unclear]phosphorus acid[/unclear] which did
not act on the water - the water [unclear]conts[/unclear] phosphorus & apparently phosphoric acids [deletion]& silver[/deletion]
but no sulphuric or sulphurous acid - The [unclear]flu[/unclear] compound was not [unclear]rendered[/unclear] solid by air
[unclear]tempetu[/unclear] of 26[superscript]o[/superscript] of Faht & [unclear]decomped[/unclear] water very slowly even at boiling temperature
there was also [unclear]suspended [/unclear]in the water a fine powder which appeared to be sulphur
& [unclear]slight film[/unclear] apparently of the same body [unclear]covered [/unclear]the compound
Another mixture of sulphur & phosphorus was [insertion][unclear]with xxxxx[/unclear][/insertion] left in the same way
  presented nearly such phenomena a compound [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] which became a [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] solid at 28[superscript]o[/superscript] [unclear]Faht[/unclear]
& was yellow then the other it did not [unclear]decomp[/unclear] water at common temperature & the solution presents the same
outcomes - A portion of this acted on by [unclear]nitrous[/unclear]acid not [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] in sufficient quantity to [unclear]solidify[/unclear]
the whole left a globule [unclear]xxx xxx[/unclear] & fluid whilst did not congeal at 32[superscript]o[/superscript] when burnt it [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
like phosphorus & very slight traces of sulphur could be observed - The [unclear]xxxxx [/unclear]mixture
appear to have had a [unclear]greater[/unclear] proportion of phosphorus than the first & it seems for about that
a small proportion of sulphur will render phosphorus [unclear]liquid [/unclear]of the admixture of
oxidised sulphur or phosphorus be [unclear]generated[/unclear]
