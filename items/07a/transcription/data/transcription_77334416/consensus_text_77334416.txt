[underline]Nickel[/underline] -
Nickel Nickel(impure) acted on by Nitrous acid gives a
Green colored solution of great strength It is difficult to crystallise the
salt the best method is to evaporate the solution a high temperature
and when sufficiently saturated to pour it into a stoppered bottle
as it cools it crystallises and the mother liquor may be poured off
or retained over it
The nitrate of Nickel is the best [insertion]salt[/insertion] from which to obtain
the hydrate or insoluble salts by precipitation for it may be
completely neutralised by the alkalies [deletion]and[/deletion] without deposition of
nickell and yet it [deletion]is not[/deletion] does not form (readily at least) [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
salts
Sulphate of Nickel
and Potash
When Nickel is finely powdered and then boiled with
Sulphuric acid [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] to dryness a greenish mass is obtained
which when washed with water yields a solution of sulphate of
Nickel When this is evaporated crystals of the salt are obtained
in prisms
If to the acid solution before evaporation potash be added
then a triple salt of S.A. Nickel & potash is formed which
crystallises in fin rhombs. this salt is but slightly soluble in
cold water. It is of a fine green colour
When Nickel and diluted sul acid are boiled together [unclear]hydrogene[/unclear]
is liberated in considerable quantities as the water evaporate the
acid [unclear]xxx[/unclear] If [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] is acted as acid abundance of sulphurous acid
[unclear]xxxxx xxx is given out[/unclear]
