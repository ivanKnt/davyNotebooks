Muriate of Nickel
When MA is boiled on finely divided nickel a solution of the
metal is formed of a fine green colour On evaporation it yields a salt very
deliquescent & difficult to [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
Chloride of Nickel
If the muriate be evaporated to dryness and then strongly heated
in close vessel a chloride of nickel is formed This substance is of yellow
colour [deletion]fibres[/deletion] it is composed of small plates [deletion]with[/deletion] having a [unclear]talky[/unclear] lustre and
it resembles very much the aurum [unclear]musivium[/unclear] It will burn a very
high heat in the fire when in masses and in close vessels without
alteration When heated[deletion] [unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] on platina slip by the blow pipe a substance
volatile at a red heat rise from it and condenses in thin crystalline
plates resembling in appearance the molybdat of lead and oxide of nickel
only remains during this process fumes of MA are given off and some
times apparently of chlorine Heated in small glass tube a very small
portion of this substance rises & much of the unchanged chlorid remains
This chlorid is deliquescent a strong solution [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] mur
of nickel runs from it and a yellow powder remains which is in
insoluble in water and when decomposed by potash appears to contain
chlorine When the chlorid is put into water it at first floats in
and about in it like scales of talk but on standing some time or
on being heated a result similar to the above is obtained
When held in the flame of the spirit lamp it colours
it as finely as the chlorid of copper does
When Nickel in a finely divided state
was heated in chlorine fumes appeared in the retort a green
