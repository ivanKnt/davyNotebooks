encrustation & of a yellow olive green colour thrown into water a
solution of muriate of nickel is formed heated on platina fumes
of MA & Chlorine [deletion]and[/deletion] [insertion]are formed[/insertion] and the volatile substance rises.
Oxide of Nickel obtained by heating metallic nickel was
heated in an atmosphere of chlorine dense fumes arose and
chlorine was absorbed the oxide became of a dark green but was
pulverulent as in the former experiment ; Thrown into water it
formed a solution of muriate of nickel and heated on platina
it evolved fumes of MA & the volatile substance
The substance contained in the last experiment were
put into a tube together and submitted to a strong red heat on
being opened it was found that that the scaly texture had been given to
the mass and towards the top it appears was near in colour & ap-
pearance to the chlorid obtained from the muriate but much [unclear]green[/unclear]
oxide was [unclear]mixed throughout[/unclear] the whole mass and at the bottom
strongly [unclear]predominated[/unclear]
Query the substance which sublimes is it another chlorid of
nickel over it a chlorid of some other metal existing accidentally with
the nickel. The chlorid of metal in delinquency forms an acid solution &
apparently a sub chlorid and it is hardly likely that a third chlorid
should exist surpassing both [unclear]these[/unclear] in its proportion of chlorine?
