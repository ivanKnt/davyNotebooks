Oxide of Nickel by heat
When nickel is powderd very fine and then heated a large
surface being exposed to the air it takes fire at a dull red heat and glows
the combustion gradually spreads over the mass and converts the metal
into a greenish oxide as the inflammation proceeds the heap of metal
gradually swells up and falls into a very fine powder [deletion]very[/deletion] in a
manner very similar to quick lime when [deletion]slaked[/deletion] water is added to
it It appears to be a peroxide
This oxide is scarcely acted on by Sulphuric Nitric or muriatic
acid perhaps the slight action that does take place depends on particles
of metal & of a minor oxide disposed amongst the substance
Hydrate of Nickel
When Nitrate of Nickel is precipitated by sol of potash
a green hydrate of nickel is thrown down It may be collected on a filter
and dried when heated to redness the water is driven off and a
black oxide is obtained permanent in close vessels but heated in
the air it is converted into the green oxide
[unclear]Ammoniat[/unclear] of Nickel
When the most well washed hydrate of nickel is added to
ammonia it is gradually dissolved & a very fine blue solution is [unclear]obtd[/unclear]
this when heated [unclear]allows[/unclear] the ammonia to fly off & oxide of nickel [unclear]falls[/unclear]
I have not [deletion]the[/deletion] yet able [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] of the ammoniat.
