Sulphate of Nickel
A concentrated solution of this salt is precipitated by sulphuric
acid and a white powder falls down which [deletion]fo[/deletion] appears to be the
an-hydrosulphate [deletion]if[/deletion] this powder is not very readily soluble in cold
water but is in boiling water and the solution when concentrated
yields the sulphate in rectangular quadrangular prisms [deletion]with [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
terminated by four sided pyramids of a solution of the sulphate under
acid by the adit. of SA [deletion]but[/deletion] not in sufficient quantities to precipitate the
crystallised the crystal [unclear]obta[/unclear] seem to be imperfect rhomboids and had
exactly the appearance of a leaf they are very friable and slightly deliquescent
dissolved in water they form a weakly acid solution apparently from the
adhering acid & that from their [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] nature they do not appear to
be a supersulphat. The sulphate forms a neutral solution
Acetate of Nickel
Acetic acid dissolves the hydrate as carbonate of nickel &
forms an acetate of a fine green colour the solution is generally a [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
acid it is more difficult to crystallize [unclear][deletion]a[/deletion]at[/unclear] strong heat decomposes the salt
& oxide remains
Nickel when once ignited in an atmosphere of
oxygen continues to burn and the ignition spreads gradually over
the whole mass
