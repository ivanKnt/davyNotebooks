[unclear]Magnetic[/unclear] Needle placed in Magnetic axis Neg Pole to North [unclear]W[/unclear]
Positive to South intensely inward [insertion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] of dip[/insertion] -- Positive Pole to North [unclear]End[/unclear]
Neg Pole to south much weak[superscript]r[/superscript] & South End dips about 5[underline][superscript]o[/superscript][/underline].
4 Double copper plated [unclear]batte[/unclear] were used The contacts counted about 90

Positive pole to North Neg pole to south whilst in Magnetic axis

for 1.30 rather much & dipps a little but the effect not great
The needle was wound for half an hour between the poles & became
somewhat [unclear]xxxx powerful than before but the action of the battery was
 now very weak. The positive pole was always betwn & to the north in
