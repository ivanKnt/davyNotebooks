Chloride of Strontium in ammoniacal gas after 16 days
no absorption nor suffered any change in 16 days
had absorbed about a cubical inch of gas and an appearance
of efflorescence had taken place on the edges of the broken piece.
A crystal of Calomel placed in ammoniacal gas for
14 days absorbed above half a cubical inch of gas a black superficial
coating of considerable hardness had formed on the crystal but the interior
was unaltered When heated ammoniacal gas arose from it &
the chloride sublimed. _ Not more than half of the gas that re-
mained was absorbed by water & the remainder was very like [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
[unclear]xxxx[/unclear] air whether this was accident or the effect of some decoposition of the
ammonia is doubtful
Corrosive sublimate in lump placed in ammoniacal gas
for 14 days had undergone no change in appearance but about ,25 of
a cubical inch were absorbed the remainder was entirely absorbed by
water - The C Sub heated gave out no ammonia & had exerted no
action
A piece of fused chloride of silver weighing about [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] 40 gr was
placed in ammoniacal gas it gradually and entirely absorbed
it about 6 c.c. [unclear]disappearing[/unclear] in 4 hours more was added at different times
until more than 48 c.c. had been absorbed an action took place over
the whole surface if the chloride but most abundantly at the fractured
edges of the piece where a sort of efflorescence occurred at first white
