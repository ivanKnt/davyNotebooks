Chloride of bismuth absorbs ammonial gas
Chloride of copper fuzed & immediately placed in ammonicial
gas was acted upon. At the moment it burst open like slacking lime
and fell into a blue powder it absorbed much ammoniacal gas the
 powder placed in water was decompd sol of copper in amm for small quantity heated it
formd Casts ass the ammon flow[superscript]d[/superscript] off & the chlorid remained
Proto Chloride of Iron fuzed & placed directly afterwards in A.G. had an
instant action in it & absorbed vast quantity the solid chlorid fell into a
white powder very light & adhesive. Exposed to the air it immediately
changed colour became yellow brown & in a few minutes green from the
effect of water & the separation of oxide by the ammonia heated out of
