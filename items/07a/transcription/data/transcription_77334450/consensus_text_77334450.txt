15 Gr of the hyperphosphite of barytes were precipitated
by Sulphate of soda & gave 11.3 gr of sulphate of barytes
18.4 gr of pure Phosphorane acted on by water & nitrate
of silver gave 545 chloride of silver
[Horizontal rule]
A small quantity of water added to the fluid phosphorane
Feby 28[underline][superscript]th[/superscript][/underline]
suffered no decomposition but formed the hydrate & the same
was the case with the solid phosphorana both these hydrates
mix readily with the pure compound producing no action
but if more water be added either to the hydrate or the
mixture decomposition ensues __ The fluid which appears
on making solid phosphorana from phosphorus & chlorine is
a hydrate and in [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] process for precipitating phosphorous is a
source of great error
