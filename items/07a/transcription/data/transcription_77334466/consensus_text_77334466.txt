If the colourless pure sulphate of manganese be heated
for a long time in close vessels it is converted into a reddish brown
oxide of manganese and sulphurous acid gas is given off
If this oxide be placed in contact with strong mur acid
it is immediately & entirely dissolved forming a deep red brown solution
if a little water be added the tint clears if more great part of the
oxide is precipitated
If the solution remain chlorine & the colourless oxide gradually
form in it if heated the change is more rapid
If diluted Mur acid be placed in contact with this oxide
and slightly warmed the oxide is divided part forms a colourless solution
& part become black or per oxide?
If the brown oxide be placed in contact with sul acid a solution
of it is obtained after a while of a brilliant red colour (or part rather) if heated
this colour disappears probably with loss of oxygen if slightly diluted it remains if
more no oxide is thrown down this red solution is Gay Lussacs test for Nc Acid
Benzoic acid acts upon the moist white oxide of Man-
ganese & forms a white soluble crystallizable salt
