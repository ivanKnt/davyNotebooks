Acetate of Manganese is easily formed from A A & the
dry carbonate of Manganese - The carbonate of Manganese [unclear]xx[/unclear]
dry or moist is an excellent substance to keep by one for Man
ganesian preparations
Citric acid decomposes carb of manganese & forms a soluble
citrate The solution May be evaporated almost to a paste without
crystals forming and yet a weak solution set aside some time
will deposit them on the sides of the bottle
Tartaric acid acts on the carb of Manganese the salt
is little soluble the solution is transparent the solid crystalline
grains generally have a tint of red most probably from the
presence of a little of the brown oxide
Cream of tartar boiled with the moist white oxide of Manganese
dissolves it & forms a triple tartrate more soluble than the simple
tartrate
[Horizontal rule]
There appears to be two benzoites of lead the one mor e solu-
ble than the others the first may be obtained in crystals the second in
a powder insoluble
[Horizontal rule]
The tartaric & oxalic acids act on the moist oxide of
bismuth & forms insoluble [deletion]tartrates[/deletion] salts. Benzoic acid has the
same action
If nitrates of bismuth be precipitated by soda [insertion]or potash[/insertion] in excess the
precipitate is redissolved on adding a little tartaric acid though the solu
tion remain strongly alkaline in a [deletion]very[/deletion] strong neutral solution
