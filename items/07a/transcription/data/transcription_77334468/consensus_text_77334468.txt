of bismuth may be made by adding tartrate of soda
to tartrate of bismuth & boiling them for a short time the metal
is dissolved & is not afterwards thrown down by the acids alkalies or
water Sul Hydrogen precipitates it. Query a triple tartrate of bismuth
& soda? Alkali does [deletion]not[/deletion] dissolve entirely the pure tartrate of bismuth
[Horizontal rule]
Benzoate of Silver easily made by B A & newly precipitated
July 30[superscript]th[/superscript].
oxide of silver - crystallises -
Benzoate of copper slightly soluble in water and in Acid
Alcohol
Benzoate of Zinc very fusible
Benzoate of Iron there are two of these salts The
newly precipitated [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] & per oxides both combine easily with
the hot acid in water the proto benzoate is of a dull yellow
brown tint - it is soluble in hot water and the filtered solution as it
cools becomes turbid [deletion]again[/deletion] heat restores its transparency but it again
becomes turbid as it cools The clear cold solution is colourless but
is precipitated white in abundance by prussiate of potash It
is insoluble in alcohol The salt when heated melts and
burns with a bright flame
The oxybenzoate is easily formed from the newly precipitated
oxide and benzoic acid It is a heavy orange or yellow brown
powder Perfectly insoluble in water or excess of acid It is [insertion]slightly[/insertion] soluble in
alcohol forming a light brown solution rendered turbid by prussiate of potash
& tincture of galls Heated it does not melt and rarely flames If lighted
at one part it continues burning like touchwood _ The proto
benzoate absorbs oxygen & becomes per benzoate.
