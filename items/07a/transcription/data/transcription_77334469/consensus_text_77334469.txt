Both oxides of Mercury combine with Benzoic acids
and form salts insoluble either in water or alcohol I made
them from the moist precipitates thrown down by a sub carb
from the 2 nitrates The Proto benzoate was formed with a
strong solution of Carb Acid gas it is of a white colour and
gives black oxide to the alkalis The oxybenzoate is a yellow
salt & gives a red oxide in decomposition Query the effects of
heat on them
Benzoic acid does not combine with the white oxide
Arsenic as Tromsdorf has said but when it is crystallised
by cooling a mixed hot solution of it & the white oxide in
water the Acid crystallises in beautiful needles radiating
from a centre - This circumstance illustrates Beaudants
last paper on crystallization.

50 grains of the deutoxide of Manganese from the
nitrate by heat were treated with muriatic acid

There are two benzoates of Zinc They are both formed
by acting on the newly precipitated oxide of Zinc by Benzoic acid
not in excess - The [insertion]super[/insertion] benzoate of Zinc is a soluble salt and
may be washed out by hot water from the [deletion]sub[/deletion] benzoate which
is insoluble. It crystallizes in minute needles but very confined by
