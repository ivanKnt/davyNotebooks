it is precipitated by the Alkalies &c it is very fusible and burns
with a bright flame - The sublimate benzoate is a white adhesive
powder fusible combustible with flame though not so bright as the
former and insoluble in water

The simple muriate of [deletion]Manganese[/deletion] [insertion]Zinc[/insertion] is always acid and
more acid in proportion as it is more diluted A strong solution
of Mur. [deletion]Manganese[/deletion] [insertion]Zinc[/insertion] on being diluted deposits oxide of Zinc on
further dilution more oxide is deposited and so on If solutions
thus made to deposit zinc by being diluted be evaporated &
concentrated they will then dissolve more oxide - Ammonia
added to a solution of Muriate of Zinc does not render it neutral
until all the oxide is thrown down so that the salt in solution requires
the presence of free acid and the more the more diluted it is

The Existence of Stadions per perchloric acid and
salts is not doubtful acting upon chlorate of potash
by sulphuric acid ans separating the crystals obtained
and washing them a salt results which does not give
euchlorine to sulphuric acid & which give abundance
of oxygen when heated. It does not precipitate with
Mur of barytes and therefore contains no sulphuric acid
nor does it precipitate with salts of silver until it
has been decomposed by heat & the oxygen driven off -
Chloric [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] & per perchloric acid form soluble salts with silver
