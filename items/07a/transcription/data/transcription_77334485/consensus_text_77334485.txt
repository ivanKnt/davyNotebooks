1000 Grains of French plate paper boiled in
distilled water gave a pale yellow coloured liquor which
precipitated abundantly with tincture of galls; scarcely
with alcohol; not at all with Iodine it contained jelly
but I think no gum or starch _ It barely precipitated with
Mur: Barytes and not at all with sulphate of silver - Lime
water did not precipitated it nor did Ammonia nor Sub carb of
potash Oxalate of ammonia rendered it translucent = sul
lime in small quantity
The paper lost very little colour by boiling ; and
though rendered soft did not break down into a magma
500 grains were burnt piece by piece in a pair
of forceps and the ashes received in a basin. These were acted
upon by Nitric and muriatic acids and heated there was
no effervescence ; the solution filtered off contained Iron
Lime Alumina evaporated to dryness it weighed 6.2 gr it
gave Alumina 2.4 Lime ,6 Oxide of Iron ,7 of a grain
The ashes were heated in a crucible with a little nitrate
of ammonia and left 2.0 grain of insoluble salts ; this
boiled with carb of potash and then treated with Mur Acid gave
sul: of lime and Silex the silex weighed 1.3 grains the sul: of
lime therefore .7 of a grain
The solution obtained from the paper evaporated to dry
ness weighed 15. 2 grains Alcohol did not dissolve above one sixth
of it which was extract. The solution gelatinous on cooling
sul Lime .7 Extract 2,5 gelatine 12 grains
