1000 grains of white India paper boiled for some
hours in distilled water gave a light yellow or fawn co-
loured solution. It precipitated slightly with tincture of
galls but not so much as the preceding infusion - with
alcohol very slightly - not at all with Iodine contained
very little jelly and no gum or starch ___ It was
barely affected by nitrate of silver and more evidently by
oxalate of ammonia but murr of barytes lime water and
the other test for earths and acids did not alter it _ little
mur of lime
The paper broke down much more than the French
paper on boiling but considering its thinness not to any
extent.
500 grains burnt piece by piece in a basin gave
light ashes: they were very strongly alkaline and when
acted upon by mur: acid evolved much carbonic acid. The
solution contained lime soda and a very little iron and aluminia
dried it weighed 15 grains = it gave 9 grains carb. lime & oxide of
iron and 4 grains alumine
The insoluble residuum heated with a little nitrate of
ammonia to burn off the charcoal that remained weighed 1.7
grain 1.3 of it was silex and .4 sulphate of lime.
The infusion dried into a brown mass which split
and cracked in the basin and weighed 21 grains When the con-
centrated infusion was cooled it became white & opaque but resu-
med its transparency on heat being applied It appeared to be extract
of a peculiar nature
