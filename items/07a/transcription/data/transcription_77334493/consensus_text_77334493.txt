1000 grains of yellow India paper were boiled for some
hours in distilled water and gave a light brown solution It
precipitated very slightly with tincture of galls not perceptibly
with alcohol nor with Iodine Mur of barytes and lime water
threw nothing down. Nit of silver rendered it turbid and also oxalate
of ammonia = mur of lime and water
The paper broke down much in boiling
500 grains burnt afforded ashes strongly alkaline acted on
by muriatic acid the effervesced abundantly the solution was filtered
off and the charcoal burnt off from the residue by nit of ammonia _
5.0 grains then remained
The soluble salts evaporated to dryness weighed only 5 grains
The infusion of paper dried became a dark brown solid
substance which did not crack like the former and weighed
19.5 grains It was not very soluble in water but more so in hot than
in cold water Its infusion was abundantly precipitated by galls
The 5.5 grains of insoluble matter gave 4.[deletion][unclear]X[/unclear][/deletion]7 of silex and
[deletion]1,9[/deletion] 6 of [deletion]chlorine[/deletion] iron with a little alumine
The 5 grains of soluble salts gave [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] 3 Carb of lime 1 alumine
