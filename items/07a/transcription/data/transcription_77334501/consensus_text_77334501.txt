Experiment on passage of gases _ two from similar
tubes were used 1.5 inches in length one brass the other
glass the brass tube had a wire thrust through it to
diminish its capacity to that of the glass tube - .
equal quantities of the following gases and mixtures were
sent through these tubes by the same pressure and in
precisely the same circumstances.
Glass tube
{ Olefiant gas 1 occupied 13.5 minutes
{ - 2 - D[superscript]o[/superscript] -
Glass tube
( Light Hydro carbonate from alcohol 1 occupied 18.25 seconds
( - 2 - 17.5 -
A portion of moisture gradually collected in the tube
so as naturally to affect its capacity and in substituting Olefiant
gas after the last portion hydro carbonate it in a short time ceased to
issue in consequence of a drop of Water that collected in the tube
The above experiments are therefore uncertain
Metal tube
( Olefiant gas - 1 occupied 11.5 minutes
( - - 2 - 0.75 -
{ - - 3 - 11 - -
Metal tube
{ Light hydro carbonate - 1 occupied 16.6 minutes
( - 2 - 15 - -
{ - 3 - 15 -
Metal tube
{ Mixed gas equal parts [deletion]155[/deletion] 1 ocupied 13.5 minutes
( - 2 - 13.5 -
The metal tube tested by olefiant gas at last still appeared
as open and free from water as at first
