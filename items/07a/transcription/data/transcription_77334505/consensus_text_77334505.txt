Two Globules were previously made from the iron
of Farriers nails and Nickel the one contained 4 per
cent of pure nickel it had become carbonised by first falling
into the crucible and was too brittle to forge _ the second
contained the same proportion of Iron and nickel but
was carbonised by a little lamp black it was a good perfect
globule and allowed of extension under the hammer when
hot but not in a great degree Its surface was polished and
exhibited a brilliant lustre of a very dark colour [deletion]and[/deletion] but
mottled in a very peculiar way and very unlike common
steel When acted upon by dilute nitric acid much
charcoal was liberated and the crystallised surface be-
longing to meteoric iron produced
