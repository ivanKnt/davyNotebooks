350 grains of antimony was heated with 200
grain of sulphur both finely divided the result weighed
after a bright red heat 437.7 grains of this 27.7 gr were
pure antimony in a button the quantity of sulphuret was
therefore 410 gr and that of antimony 322.3 of sulphur
therefore . 87.7 but 87.7 : 322.3 : : 15 : 55.12
100 grains of the sulphuret heated with Sul -
acid threw the salt decomposed by Soda gave 88.49 grs of oxides
50 grains heated with nitric acid Little Mur acid
acid the sul acid separated by barytes gave 94.9 gr sul: barytes
= 13 sulphur 37 antimony or 15 sul + 43 antimony
100 gr contain 74 antimony which plus 14.49 oxygen = 88.49 oxide
