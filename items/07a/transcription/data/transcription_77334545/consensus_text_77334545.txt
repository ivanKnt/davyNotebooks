460 gr best Wootz heated with acid as
before gave - Silex .3 of a grain and Alumin .6 of a
grain
.625 gr Indian Steel of second Wootz heated
as the other gave very little of the black powder
contained no silex but .15 of a grain of alumin
420 English Steel treated as above gave
plenty of the bi carbonate but no earths were in it
there was a very little alumine but being a com-
parative experiment on the tints alone it was
found to come from them (it could not be
collected.).
