Put in the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of Feby 16[superscript]th[/superscript] and the one
last mentioned above fire excellent at 5 oclk
about 7. missed one in the furnace stopped the fire
and searched for it. found the crucible had softened
and sunk down. the other crucible also had folded
itself into a plait took them out._ but the
metal was gone - the mould clay & crucible
were all fuzed together into a porcallanous mass
and the metal appeared to have escaped below
either by a crack of from its weight forcing through.
The soft crucible or [deletion]its[/deletion] perhaps by acting on and
decomposing the earths of the crucible and mould
