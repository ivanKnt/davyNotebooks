Palm Wine in stone bottle had a smell like that
of fermenting beer the atmosphere in the bottle contained much
carbonic acid and extinguished a taper. - taste of the wine
very sweet & somewhat acid acted readily on litmus paper con-
tained both acetic & carbonic acid Appearance of the wine
a pale milky aqueous fluid which when placed on a filter
passed through it very slowly & became transparent 8 oz more
of it were taken & distilled [insertion]with a little powdered marble[/insertion] untill nearly 4 fifths had
passed over and the bulk was then made up by pure
water. It tasted slightly acid & bitter; a little alcoholic; affected litmus
but not lime water Its Specific Gravity = 993.[deletion]4[/deletion]7 at 55[superscript]o[/superscript] [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
about 4.7 per cent of alcohol
The portion left in the retort was evaporated until
it formed a thick syrup and then acted on by alcohol
a brown solution was formed & a soft substance weighing
70 grains left it was insoluble in alcohol but [insertion]partly[/insertion] soluble
in water and resembled gum and albumen mixed
The alcohol solution deposited some minute crystals
of Tartar and gave 167 grs of sugar in a hard brown cake.
The filtered first portion gave with alcohol a precipitate
of gum and the insoluble substance left behind when heated
in a tube gave off abundance of ammonia & appeared to
be vegetable albumen
