Cormantyne apple juice expressed - filtered -
evaporated _ treated with alcohol - an insoluble substance
separated and a reddish brown acid solution was obtained -
the insoluble substance was dissolved in water and filtered
it was precipitated in a gelatinous bulky state by
alcohol and formed the gelly like substance with per-
sulphate of iron It was mucilage _ Ammonia in
excess was added to the alcoholic solution and made
it very turbid on standing a quantity of a thick
dense. very dark coloured solution had fallen over which
the alcoholic solution now much cleared floated

drive off all free ammonia [deletion]and the whol[/deletion] and gave
a stiff brown substance like thick gum. This was
somewhat soluble in alcohol containing water it had
its solubility diminished by adding ammonia &
very much increased by the addition of Mur Acid
