Egg laid May 3 taken from the hen May 19[superscript]th[/superscript].
gave over mercury 1/2 cubical inch of air [insertion]some [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] - . to these 5 tent
five tenths were added of Nitrous gas the absorption was to
7 tenths and by sulphate of Iron to 4 tenths which
were azote - I should say that caustic potash absorbed
none of the gas
Another egg same date & age opened under water
gave 1.25 cubical inch of gas. Not the slightest absorption
by caustic potash - The end of the tube now broke out
& the gas could not be examined farther. this
New laid egg over mercury gave 1/30 of cub inch of gas - no
carb acid could be perceived but oxygen & azote as in the air
Another new laid egg broken under water gave 1/40 of
cub. inch of gas containing no carb. acid but oxygen & azote as
in the atmosphere
