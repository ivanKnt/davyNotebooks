Sulphuret of Molybdena with Nitric acid - washed
the white mass produced several times collecting the washings
together. Acted on the white portion by excess of ammonia
which left only quartz in powder & a little sulphuret _ evapora-
ted the filtered pale brown solution and got a neutral
Molybdate of Ammonia in crystals apparently rhomboidal
prisms with oblique bases.
The acid washings were filtered and evaporated when
concentrated it was when cold deep blue when hot green or
even yellowish Evaporated in a platinum capsule much sul-
phuric acid flew off and the mass became dry & crystallised
green hot blue when cold _ It deliquesced very rapidly and on
being [deletion]was[/deletion] diluted with water and heated deposited [insertion]a[/insertion] dark
blue sand and a very acid light blue solution remained The
dark blue deposit when well washed did not appear
soluble in water The solution evaporated the same
appearances as before and gave on driving off the excess of
sul acid & washing more of the blue powder (Molybdous acid
Molybdous acid dissolves in Sul A[superscript]d[/superscript] forming a solution intense
blue when cold - green or colourless when hot. Precipitate of
potash thrown down from this when very diluted a deep [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] brown
precipitated Molybdous acid is soluble in ammonia also precipiate of
potash throws nothing down until Sul or any other acid is added & then
the brown precipiate of Molybdenum falls.
Molybdic acid is readily converted into the blue molybdous
acid by Sul acid If molybdic acid be heated with excess of sul acid
