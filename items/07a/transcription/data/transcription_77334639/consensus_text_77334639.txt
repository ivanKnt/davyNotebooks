the blue solution before mentioned is formed which precipitates brown with
prussiat of potash or if molybdate of Lead potash or ammonia be treated
with sul acid the same solution is formed. In the process for Molybdic acid by
MA. much Molybdous acid is lost in the washing from this source
Perhaps the best process for Molybdous acid would be to heat Molybdic
acid or Molybdate of ammonia (being then pure) with sulphuric acid in excess [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
of the excess of S.A. until the compound burns solid but not farther and
then wash with pure water
Mur & Nitrous acid also dissolve Molybdous acid and they appear to
convert Molybdic acid into the Molybdous which with respect to N.A. A is very
curious if either of them be boiled with Molybdic acid the blue solution is
 obtained If Prussiate of potash is added to a soluble [insertion]neutral[/insertion] molybdate immediately
on adding M or N acid the deep brown precipitate so occasioned &c
Molybdous acid heated with potash is not converted into
Molybdic acid for the solution though colourless instantly precipitates
prussiate of potash
