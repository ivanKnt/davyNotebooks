         <p>Commonly known as quicklime or burnt lime, calcium oxide is a widely used chemical

         <p>An alkaline substance consisting largely of impure potassium carbonate. In October

         <p>Symbol/formula: K2O</p>
         
         <p>Potassium oxide. In his 'Elements of Chemical Philosophy', Pt 1, Vol 1 (1812), Davy
            describes how potassa is produced from heating potassium at a low temperature, producing
            a substance containing a large amount of oxygen. When this substance is "heated very
            strongly", it produces "pure potash or potassa" (pp. 323-324).</p>
