Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the action of phosphorus
upon Charcoal at high temperature
Passed phosphorus in Vapor over
well burned charcoal heated
red in an earthen Tube -
No fluid matter formed
Gas Copiously evolved - collected
over Mercury - It is a compound
of Carb hydro. and phosphorus
Proportions not definite -
In this experiment there is not the
slightest formation of water.
Octob. 24
When earthen tubes are used they
Should be first heated red
to expel the water which they
contain.
Above experiment repeated
in Iron tube - less gas evolved
When earthen tubes are used they
invariably crack where the
phosphorus first touches the
red hot part.

Oct 28.
In preparing Lampadius'
liquor abundance of Sulphur[superscript]d[/superscript]
hydrogen is evolved, both in Iron
and in Earthen tubes -
Earthen tubes are porous to Sulphur
& phosphorus.

November 3.
Put charcoal into an iron tube heated
bright red - The charcoal was previously
ignited. - Sulphur was introduced
which caused abundant evolution
of Sulphuretted hydrogen gas - When
this had ceased a fresh piece
of Sulphur Caused more gas -
but not copious - A piece of
red hot charcoal was put into
the tube & Sul. hydro was now
very rapidly evolved -
Does not this prove that some
of the hydro. comes from the charcoal
The Sulp[superscript]d[/superscript] hydro evolved can
contain no charcoal - no
carb. hydro. can be evolved -
because sulphur at high
temperature decomposes

[underline]Nickel[/underline] -
Nickel Nickel(impure) acted on by Nitrous acid gives a
Green colored solution of great strength It is difficult to crystallise the
salt the best method is to evaporate the solution a high temperature
and when sufficiently saturated to pour it into a stoppered bottle
as it cools it crystallises and the mother liquor may be poured off
or retained over it
The nitrate of Nickel is the best [insertion]salt[/insertion] from which to obtain
the hydrate or insoluble salts by precipitation for it may be
completely neutralised by the alkalies [deletion]and[/deletion] without deposition of
nickell and yet it [deletion]is not[/deletion] does not form (readily at least) [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
salts
Sulphate of Nickel
and Potash
When Nickel is finely powdered and then boiled with
Sulphuric acid [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] to dryness a greenish mass is obtained
which when washed with water yields a solution of sulphate of
Nickel When this is evaporated crystals of the salt are obtained
in prisms
If to the acid solution before evaporation potash be added
then a triple salt of S.A. Nickel & potash is formed which
crystallises in fin rhombs. this salt is but slightly soluble in
cold water. It is of a fine green colour
When Nickel and diluted sul acid are boiled together [unclear]hydrogene[/unclear]
is liberated in considerable quantities as the water evaporate the
acid [unclear]xxx[/unclear] If [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] is acted as acid abundance of sulphurous acid

Carbonate of Nickel
The Alkaline Carbonates when added to solutions of

in water or in phosphoric acid but soluble in Muriatic [deletion]acid or[/deletion]
Nitric acid
20 gr of the chloride of metal were dissolved in water 5.5 gr
of the peroxide (that insoluble in the acids & of a green colour) remained
undissolved the solution preipitated by nit. of silver yielded chlorid
of silver which when fused weighed 34.44 [superscript][unclear]x[/unclear][/superscript] ( Chlor of Silver 24.5 [unclear]Pl.al[/unclear][insertion][unclear]chlorine[/unclear][/insertion]

Muriate of Nickel
When MA is boiled on finely divided nickel a solution of the
metal is formed of a fine green colour On evaporation it yields a salt very
deliquescent & difficult to [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
Chloride of Nickel
If the muriate be evaporated to dryness and then strongly heated
in close vessel a chloride of nickel is formed This substance is of yellow
colour [deletion]fibres[/deletion] it is composed of small plates [deletion]with[/deletion] having a [unclear]talky[/unclear] lustre and
it resembles very much the aurum [unclear]musivium[/unclear] It will burn a very
high heat in the fire when in masses and in close vessels without
alteration When heated[deletion] [unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] on platina slip by the blow pipe a substance
volatile at a red heat rise from it and condenses in thin crystalline
plates resembling in appearance the molybdat of lead and oxide of nickel
only remains during this process fumes of MA are given off and some
times apparently of chlorine Heated in small glass tube a very small
portion of this substance rises & much of the unchanged chlorid remains
This chlorid is deliquescent a strong solution [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] mur
of nickel runs from it and a yellow powder remains which is in
insoluble in water and when decomposed by potash appears to contain
chlorine When the chlorid is put into water it at first floats in
and about in it like scales of talk but on standing some time or
on being heated a result similar to the above is obtained
When held in the flame of the spirit lamp it colours
it as finely as the chlorid of copper does
When Nickel in a finely divided state
was heated in chlorine fumes appeared in the retort a green

[page]108||dnp07a098pp|77334428[/page]
colour spreads over the powder and chlorine is absorbed a continuation
of the heat does not alter the powder but it remains [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear]
encrustation & of a yellow olive green colour thrown into water a
solution of muriate of nickel is formed heated on platina fumes
of MA & Chlorine [deletion]and[/deletion] [insertion]are formed[/insertion] and the volatile substance rises.
Oxide of Nickel obtained by heating metallic nickel was
heated in an atmosphere of chlorine dense fumes arose and
chlorine was absorbed the oxide became of a dark green but was
pulverulent as in the former experiment ; Thrown into water it
formed a solution of muriate of nickel and heated on platina
it evolved fumes of MA & the volatile substance
The substance contained in the last experiment were
put into a tube together and submitted to a strong red heat on
being opened it was found that that the scaly texture had been given to
the mass and towards the top it appears was near in colour & ap-
pearance to the chlorid obtained from the muriate but much [unclear]green[/unclear]
oxide was [unclear]mixed throughout[/unclear] the whole mass and at the bottom
strongly [unclear]predominated[/unclear]
Query the substance which sublimes is it another chlorid of
nickel over it a chlorid of some other metal existing accidentally with
the nickel. The chlorid of metal in delinquency forms an acid solution &
apparently a sub chlorid and it is hardly likely that a third chlorid
should exist surpassing both [unclear]these[/unclear] in its proportion of chlorine?

[page]109||dnp07a099pp|77334429[/page]

Oxide of Nickel by heat
When nickel is powderd very fine and then heated a large
surface being exposed to the air it takes fire at a dull red heat and glows
the combustion gradually spreads over the mass and converts the metal
into a greenish oxide as the inflammation proceeds the heap of metal
gradually swells up and falls into a very fine powder [deletion]very[/deletion] in a
manner very similar to quick lime when [deletion]slaked[/deletion] water is added to
it It appears to be a peroxide
This oxide is scarcely acted on by Sulphuric Nitric or muriatic
acid perhaps the slight action that does take place depends on particles
of metal & of a minor oxide disposed amongst the substance
Hydrate of Nickel
When Nitrate of Nickel is precipitated by sol of potash
a green hydrate of nickel is thrown down It may be collected on a filter
and dried when heated to redness the water is driven off and a
black oxide is obtained permanent in close vessels but heated in
the air it is converted into the green oxide
[unclear]Ammoniat[/unclear] of Nickel
When the most well washed hydrate of nickel is added to
ammonia it is gradually dissolved & a very fine blue solution is [unclear]obtd[/unclear]
this when heated [unclear]allows[/unclear] the ammonia to fly off & oxide of nickel [unclear]falls[/unclear]
I have not [deletion]the[/deletion] yet able [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] of the ammoniat.

[page]110||dnp07a100pp|77334430[/page]
Sulphate of Nickel
A concentrated solution of this salt is precipitated by sulphuric
acid and a white powder falls down which [deletion]fo[/deletion] appears to be the
an-hydrosulphate [deletion]if[/deletion] this powder is not very readily soluble in cold
water but is in boiling water and the solution when concentrated
yields the sulphate in rectangular quadrangular prisms [deletion]with [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
terminated by four sided pyramids of a solution of the sulphate under
acid by the adit. of SA [deletion]but[/deletion] not in sufficient quantities to precipitate the
crystallised the crystal [unclear]obta[/unclear] seem to be imperfect rhomboids and had
exactly the appearance of a leaf they are very friable and slightly deliquescent
dissolved in water they form a weakly acid solution apparently from the
adhering acid & that from their [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] nature they do not appear to
be a supersulphat. The sulphate forms a neutral solution
Acetate of Nickel
Acetic acid dissolves the hydrate as carbonate of nickel &
forms an acetate of a fine green colour the solution is generally a [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
acid it is more difficult to crystallize [unclear][deletion]a[/deletion]at[/unclear] strong heat decomposes the salt
& oxide remains
Nickel when once ignited in an atmosphere of
oxygen continues to burn and the ignition spreads gradually over
the whole mass

If the colourless pure sulphate of manganese be heated
for a long time in close vessels it is converted into a reddish brown
oxide of manganese and sulphurous acid gas is given off
If this oxide be placed in contact with strong mur acid
it is immediately & entirely dissolved forming a deep red brown solution
if a little water be added the tint clears if more great part of the
oxide is precipitated
If the solution remain chlorine & the colourless oxide gradually
form in it if heated the change is more rapid
If diluted Mur acid be placed in contact with this oxide
and slightly warmed the oxide is divided part forms a colourless solution
& part become black or per oxide?
If the brown oxide be placed in contact with sul acid a solution
of it is obtained after a while of a brilliant red colour (or part rather) if heated
this colour disappears probably with loss of oxygen if slightly diluted it remains if
more no oxide is thrown down this red solution is Gay Lussacs test for Nc Acid

Citric acid decomposes carb of manganese & forms a soluble

the blue solution before mentioned is formed which precipitates brown with

with sul acid the same solution is formed. In the process for Molybdic acid by

Mur & Nitrous acid also dissolve Molybdous acid and they appear to
