Aug. 27. Carbonate of uranium dried on the sand bath but containing a
little water
30 gr with Mur acid over Mercury gave 2.9 c.i. carbonic acid gas
= 1.32 gr carbonic acid
30 gr heated over spirit lamp lost 3.2 gr - heated red hot in
the fire remained unchanged - heated white hot for 5 minutes the
whole loss was 3.4 gr . hence oxide = 26.6
Ether dissolves 265 times its vol of fluoboric gas
50 gr hydrated oxide uranium heated red lost 6.1 gr - a little carb acid formd
50 gr heated sub-sulphate uranium in N  M acid - contained
.7 of gr glass therefore 49.3 gr sub sulphate - gave 29.5 gr sul barytes = 10 sul [unclear]xx[/unclear]
