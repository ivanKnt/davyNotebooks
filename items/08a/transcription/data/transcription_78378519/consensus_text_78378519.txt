Sept 17. [unclear]Triple[/unclear] Mur of Ammonia & [unclear]p[/unclear]latinum a portion heated
in a glass retort and the gas collected over [underline]water[/underline] gave 3.15 c inches
of nitrogen equivalent if resulting from the decomposition of ammonia by
chlorine to 9.45 c i of chlorine = 7.2 gr The platinum left weighed

A second portion decomposed by heat gave 3.56 c i of nitrogen equiva-
lent to 10.68 cii of chlorine = 8.14 gr - Platinum weighed 10.5 gr
or 72 chlorine

Sept 18. [unclear]Tripl[/unclear] Mur of ammonia & platinum carefully prepared and dried
under receiver over Sul acid - not quite dry by this process.
A portion decomposed by heat gave 2.18 ci of nitrogen equivalent to
6.54 ci chlorine = 4.987 gr - The platinum was 6.5 gr
or Chlorine 72
Platinum 93.5
20.8 gr of the salt were distilled at red heat & lost 10.1 gr of water
nitrogen and Mur acid - the mur ann left undecomposed amo[unclear]xxx[/unclear] [unclear]xxx[/unclear] to
