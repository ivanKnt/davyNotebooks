<[underline]Sol fluoric acid[/underline]>
Tube with mixture for silicated fluoric acid + Sul Acid. has been
sealed up several days - no distinct separation of any thing from
it distilled at temp of 212° nothing rose - end broken off
much [unclear]sil[/unclear] fluoric gas came out in a rush - had been great pressure
within - some drops which before the tube was opened appeared
clear and liquid no became thick and opaque - try in a large tube
<[underline]Carb acid[/underline]>
Tube with carb amm + Sul A - has been sealed 4 or 5 days - but
no apparent separation of fluid or any other result nothing rose
when distilled at 212°. end broken a powerful explosion took place
blowing the tube into atoms
<[underline]Sulphurous acid[/underline]>
Mercury + Sul Acid - sealed up & heated - plenty of action
and much sulphate of mercury produced by degrees a limpid
fluid (colourless) passed over which when the action had been continued
for a short time only would again mix with the sulphuric acid
in the tube but when the Sulphuric acid was saturated with
sulphurous acid it would not mix with it but remained
separate floating on it. When the saturated sulphuric acid was
distilled it gave off gas which condensed into the fluid
A tube containing the fluid opened it did not explode or the
substance instantly pass into vapour but it quickly evaporated
producing cold . It was not so rapid in its evaporation as the fluid
chlorine. It entirely evaporated producing no visible fumes but
the pure smell of sulphurous acid gas hence not a compd of sul. &
[unclear]xxx[/unclear] acids The gas which first rises is rapidly absorbed by the Sul. acid a this pressure
but the [unclear]after[/unclear] portions distil over into the further end of the vessel
Make it by condensation of dry gas in tube Su [deletion]Feby[/deletion] [insertion]March[/insertion] 20[superscript]th[/superscript]
opened under Mercury the liquid expands into Sulphurous acid gas - Water added to
immediate ebullition from heat communicated So gas gas evolved & sol of So gas [unclear]formed[/unclear]
Fluid does not solidify or thicken at 0° F.
