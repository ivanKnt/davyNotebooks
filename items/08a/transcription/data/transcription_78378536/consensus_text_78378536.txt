<[underline]Sulphuretted hydrogen[/underline]>
Sulphuret of Iron & Muriatic acid in tube sealed up then
brought in contact & heated to 200°. Much gas liberated and some
sulphur. After some time distillation separation a very fluid colour
less body not miscible with the rest of the fluid in the tube - it
was very volatile - the tube opened did not burst asunder
but the fluid expanded into sulphuretted hydrogen leaving no
residuum
Make it by condensation of dry gas in tube
Tube opened under water - fluid expanded into Sul Hy gas - does not
thicken or solidify at 0° F - is very volatile more so than sulphurous acid -
Copper & N. A. in tube after 12 hours & heating to 212 - no separation of
fluid - on breaking the end a rush of Nitrous Gas but no evident change of
the fluid within - much nit of copper had been formed
<[underline]Hydrogen[/underline]>
Zinc & dilute Sul acid - in tube for 12 hours & heated to 212°. Nothing
separated by distillation between 212° & 0° opened powerful expansion
driving all out of the tube
Another very thick tube after some days burst spontaneously
having given no indication of fluid Hydrogen
