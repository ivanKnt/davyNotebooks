Sulphuric acid + chlorate of potash in tube sealed up [insertion]Feby 20[/insertion] has now
been left for 24 hours - SA dark colour & atmosphere bright distilled from 100[superscript]o[/superscript]
to 0[superscript]o[/superscript] [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]after some trials fluid Euchlorine obtained - the SA & salt [deletion]became[/deletion] lost their
dark colour by degrees and became light yellow and a very fluid etherial looking
body condensed in the cold part - not [unclear]mixable[/unclear] with a small portion of the
Sul Acid which lay beneath it but if returned back on to the mass of
acid & salt it soon spread through it apparently combining with and ren-
dering it of a much deeper colour even in places than itself. A colour
was deep yellow becoming bright yellow when the tube was [unclear]tholy[/unclear] moistened with it
One tube containing a portion of it at the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] end was opened at the opposite extremity
there was a rush of gas but the salt plugged up the aperture whilst [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] this [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]

[unclear]body[/unclear] is wholly in the state of vapour. This appears to be Cagniard de la Tour experiment
the body is at these temperatures just at the point where it will become either
fluid or vapour -
Ascertain bulks of vapour & fluid by cooling - also nature of more fixed fluid - also
break tube under water & collect the gas - The atmosphere the most condensed & powerful

Carb Amm & Sul acid - after many trials and explosions obtained fluid Carb
acid - in appearance like the other fluids but atmosphere much more powerful
it did not appear st common temp but by distilling between 50[superscript]o[/superscript] & 0[superscript]o[/superscript] it
suddenly condensed at 0[superscript]o[/superscript] . after a awhile the tube burst spontaneously
with powerful explosion - Feby 20. Put some more tubes to work have now
got the Carbonic acid fluid & can keep it Is colourless very limpid & fluid &
floats on & over the Sul Acid in the tube
