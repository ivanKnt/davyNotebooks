<[underline]Sulphurous acid[/underline]>
Plenty of Sulphurous acid in tubes - opened one & put a globule
of Mercury into it - did not appear to freeze it - In order to prove
its dryness Made some Suls acid gas over mercury - Dried the tube
used for chlorine compression - exhausted & filled it with the sulphu
rous acid and then with a syringe threw in to the amount of 5
or 6 atmospheres of the same gas. The tube remained dry and clear
but on cooling the end to 0° the fluid sulphurous acid came
trickling down [deletion]not[/deletion] & in colour limpidity evaporability under at
mospheric pressure & was exactly like that obtained in the
close tubes . Pressure by expt within tube 84.7/27.8 = 3.05 -1 = 2.05 or
about 2 atmospheres
<[underline]Nitrous oxide[/underline]>
March 21.- Other tubes of Ni oxide - plenty of it. boils & distils between
50° & 0° - opened expanded with great force into gas leaving plan dry. Opened
a tube under water collected & examined gas was Ni oxide - examd
fluid left in tube water slightly acid but no N of Amm left. - fluid
is lighter than water much.
<[underline]Phosphuretted hydrogen[/underline]>
March 21.
Phosphuretted hydrogen - tubes with phosphuret lime acid
Mur acid strong - after some days could not by distilling or
cooling get indices of fluid Phosphuretted hydrogen One tube burst
spontaneously the other had its end broken & produced a very
loud explosion - must have been great pressure within -
dry again .
