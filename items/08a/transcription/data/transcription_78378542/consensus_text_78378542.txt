<[underline]Cyanogen[/underline]>
Pure dry cyanuret of mercury [deletion]dried[/deletion] heated in a tube obtained fluid cya
nogen - colourless transparent - very fluid lighter than water - rather
less refractive power - tube opened fluid expanded into gas leaving
tube dry - opened under mercury collected gas & examd - was cyanogen
Pressure by guage within the tube 293/67 = 4.37 atmospheres at 45° this
minus about 2/3 = 3.7 atmospheres for cyanogen . - insoluble in
water - tube open produced great cold by evaporation becoming
coated with ice.
<[underline]Oxygen[/underline]>
Chlorate of potash heated [deletion]& in[/deletion] in a green glass tube the other
end being at 0°. decomposition produced but no condensation
at last the tube exploded with great force
<[underline]Fluosilicic gas[/underline]>
