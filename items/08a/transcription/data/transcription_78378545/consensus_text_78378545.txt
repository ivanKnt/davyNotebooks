[underline]Nitrous Oxide[/underline] very much less than water
[underline]Muriatic acid[/underline] less than water greater than nitrous oxide nearer to
nitrous oxide than to water
[underline]Carbonic acid[/underline] much less than water perhaps about Mur acid
[underline]Chlorine[/underline] rather less than water
[underline]Cyanogen[/underline] very like water perhaps a little less
[underline]Sulphurous acid[/underline] as near as may be to water
[underline]Sulphuretted hydrogen[/underline] near water perhaps rather more decidedly a
little more than sulphurous acid

Pressure of Mur Acid vapour
At temp of  32° 133/4.6 = 28.9 which means ,9 for [unclear]air[/unclear] gives 28 atmosphere
At temp of 50° 133/3.84 = 34.4 - 1 = 33.4 atmospheres at 50°
