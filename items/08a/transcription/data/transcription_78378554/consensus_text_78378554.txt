in Min of .772
Suls acid - hydrom. 1.102. floats with much free stem
out of liquid ( perhaps 1.3 ) opened in air [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] 1.22 floated
strongly. 1.434 I believe sank. ( try about 1.4 ) - platina wire
put in a [unclear]xxxx[/unclear it boil - & wire then so cold froze to any layers
could find no taste in fluid - again tried 1.434 . sank
slowly. I believe it to be very nearly 1.42
Cyanogen - hydrom .908 put in - it sinks in the
cyanogen but not quickly S.G [deletion]for[/deletion] a little less than 0.9
S.G of Sul Hy - 0.9.
- Cyanogen - 0.9.
- Suls acid - 1.42
