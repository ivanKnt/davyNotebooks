1823 Sept 1.
Musket balls from Shrapnell shells
Have lain in the bottom of Ships and probably had sea
water amongst them. Some slightly acted on others more
deeply and some changed entirely through the ball
The substance is hard and brittle it splits on the ball and
presents an appearance like some hard varieties of earthy
haematite colour [deletion]dark[/deletion] brown becoming when heated red
and fusing on platinum foil into a yellow flaky substance
like litharge - powdered & boiled in water no M A. or lead in
the solution. dissolved in N A diluted without leaving any
residuum and the solution gave very faint indicis only of
Mur acid. It is a prot oxide of lead - probably formed
by galvanic action of the iron shell the leaden balls and the
sea water. Query the state of the shells for the iron would
be the positive element.
[horizontal rule]
Balls from cartridges 15 years old and which have been
probably in a damp magazine - covered with warty excres
censes which rise much above the surface of the balls and which
when removed are found to have lain in small pits formed beneath
They consist of carbonate of lead and when dissolved by weak
N A. shew the corrosion of the metal which has produced them
The nitre and charcoal of the [insertion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/insertion] (lead) must here have acted with
the metal in producing complicated changes and it would be
worth while examining the powder surrounding the balls
