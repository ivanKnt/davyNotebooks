1823 Sept 4 .
Thickened oil from the Cylinder of Perkin's Engine
Was black and dirty - digested in hot Alcohol and the clear solution
set aside [unclear]flocxxxx[/unclear] separated from it on cooling which when dried
collected and fused gave a grayish substance of a waxy lustre &
appearance but rather more brittle. heat softens and melts it &
it burns like fat [insertion]it does not melt in boiling water[/insertion] it is a little lighter than water but not much
so. it dissolves readily in alkalies more readily than oil or fat
forming a turbid solution
and in this respect resembles Chevreuls acids of fat as well also
as in its solubility in alcohol when burnt it leaves an ash
consisting principally of carbonate of lime . It is not soluble
in ether or very slightly so - it contains scarcely an appreciable
trace of copper .
The alcohol which has deposited the above substance
on evaporation affords a portion of a substance similar in
many respects but much softer even fluid. It burns in the
same way. - leaves a slight ash of Carb lime &.&.
When the action of the alcohol is continued sufficiently long
nothing remains but dirt & mechanical impurities
A [deletion]softer[/deletion] portion of softer grease from the cylinder gave
results which were similar but softer from the presence of
some oil but little changed

& 1 olive oil. is solid at common temperatures but readily fuses - boiled in alcohol
