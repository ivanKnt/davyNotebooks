1823. Sept. 11
Milky water from Perkins Engine evaporated left waxy substance
soluble in alcohol like the solid substance When filtered the latter
portions are nearly transparent & contain very little of the altered
fat it having separated on the filter. The milky water is merely a
mixture of water with the finely divided indurated fat its infusibility
in boiling water accounts for the permanence of the mixture, to a great [unclear]extent[/unclear]

Sept. 19[superscript]th[/superscript]. Alkaline solution of osmium , brown - sulphuric acid
added to it blackened it like ink and threw down an abundant
precipitate the solution being left colourless . The precipitate
collected washed and dried by spontaneous evaporation was a
very black powder which heated in a tube gave water scin-
tillated and then metallic films arose but a large portion
remained fixed at a red heat the tube smelled very strongly
of oxide of osmium and when cold abundant crystals formed in
the drops of water in its upper part. These crystals dissolved rea
dily in water and the solution stained the hand smelled and tested
like solution of oxide of osmium they were white & transparent
and were probably hydrated oxide of osmium The fixed powder
taken out and heated in the air by blow pipe underwent
no change not burning away but when heated with potash it
gave a dark brown mixture which dissolved in water and [unclear]tested[/unclear]
[unclear]neutraled[/unclear] by Sul acid and test gave very much oxide of osmium
Excess of acid added at first redissolves the precipitate and the
addition of alkali restores it [unclear]whilst[/unclear] excess again redissoves it
The precipitate and colourless solution being separated from
a mixture of water with the finely divided
