again thrown down by the addition of sulphuric acid Water does not
dissolve it or any osmium oxide out of it - It dissolves slightly in
dilute sul acid & the solution gives the bluish tint with galls.
Ammonia does not seem to dissolve it or only with difficulty
Mercury in Alkaline solution appeared to precipitate the osmi
um in part and the colour became much lighter and pinkish but
There was very slight trace of oxide of mercury and the solution con
