over the platinum from heated Mur Amm & Plat. the platinum heated

Passed the hydrogen over the platinum in a small long tube
it heated at the beginning of the platinum but not farther in stop
ped the current till all cool then again renewed it heated again
as before - (not up to ignition or near it). Suspected Common
air in the hydrogen
Prepared another tube & fresh hydrogen the platinum heated
at first but when all the common air out of the tube &
stopcock then no further heating by passing hydrogen over -
even [deletion]th[/deletion] the tube tube previously cooled The hydrogen
issuing from the end of the tube ignited platinum in the air
just as [deletion]before[/deletion] in the first instance
Prepared a small  retort of capacity of 5.7 cub inches introduced
some platina exhausted it twice & filled it with Nitrogen then
exhausted & let in freshly made hydrogen in a few seconds the
platinum [deletion]warmed[/deletion] became warm in the retort and on again opening the retort
when it had cooled, 8 of c.i. more hydrogen entered Then again
the platinum being cold the retort was opened carefully and the
platinum put out in the hand It became hot whilst lying

Some fresh platinum being prepared 35gr were put in the
