vessel containing hydrogen ignited as it fell by the pail where
the hydrogen was in contact with the air. It would probably
fire a mixture of oxygen & hydrogen or air & hydrogen
It is evident from the platina in the retort that it has the
power whilst so finely divided of condensing the hydrogen about it pro-
bably to a very great extent (something like charcoal) and also that
in this state the hydrogen is capable of combining with oxygen with
out any previous elevation of temperature as shewn by the heating
of the hydrogen & platina in the air. and the ignition of the platinum
before a stream of hydrogen [deletion]is th[/deletion] in the air is therefore easily
explained as the temperature first elevated by condensation would go
on increasing by the continued combination of the hydrogen with the
oxygen.
I tried hydrogen on gold thrown down by Sulphate of Iron
but could get no effect of heat
Supposing that this peculiar state induced by the plati
num on the hydrogen and which evidently rendered it capable
of combining with oxygen when it otherwise would not have done
might enable it also to combine with other bodies I passed a
mixture of hydrogen with a little chlorine over the platinum
in the tube - I did not perceive any combination probably
the chlorine had acted on the platinum
But mixing 1 Vol Nitrogen & 3 Vols hydrogen together and
passing them over platinum in a tube although there was no
action at common temperatures nor at or above a visible heat
yet when the tube was heated below a visible heat perhaps to 400Â°
[underline]ammonia[/underline] was formed in such quantity as to redden turmeric paper
held against the end of the tube and be sensible by its odour
