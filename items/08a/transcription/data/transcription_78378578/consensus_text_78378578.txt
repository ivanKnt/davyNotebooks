washed and dried - [unclear]pale[/unclear] yellow powder - very bitter - smell nitric -
heated first tended to fuse then frothed and burnt - smell of N A.
fumes - Boiled in water - softens - fuses - gives yellow solution very
bitter which on cooling deposits a yellow powder but retains some in
solution - Solution acid to litmus - more water boiled an it dis
solved the whole of it - Oil of turpentine dissolves part & leaves part
Substance dissolves in alcohol giving deep coloured solution on
evaporation Left matter unchanged - Water precipitates it.
Mur Acid does not dissolve it - Strong S.A. chars it and becomes
coloured - Strong N.A. dissolves it and if heated in it decomposes it
Potash in excess forms a deep brown solution with it when carefully
[unclear]added[/unclear] a neutral yellow solution is obtained which evaporated leaves
a chestnut brown brittle substance - this again soluble in water - this
substance deliquescent - when heated suddenly frothed up ignited
leaving a charcoal and much carb. potash - Alcohol dissolves it yellow
substance on evaporation. nothing remarkable - substance like resin
Ether dissolves a little of it - Not soluble in oil of turpentine though
Resin is so.
