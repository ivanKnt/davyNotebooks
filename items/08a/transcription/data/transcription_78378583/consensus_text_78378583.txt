250 gr ferro prussiat potash } boiled no pruss pota
660 gr proto sul [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]mercury } in the solution
350 added 100 gr pruss pot more - boiled now much pruss pot
in solution
760 added 100 gr proto sul mercury boiled now no pruss pot
in solution - From whole 360 gr [deletion]prot[/deletion] [unclear]cyanuret[/unclear] of mercury
240 residuum of which 160 fixed the rest probably cyanuret mercury

When pruss pot in excess a precipte which floats long in
solution greyish at first but rendered blue by exposure to
oxygen either of air or n.a. - m a & . liberated hydro cyan
acid - when heated much mercury metallic appeared and
oxide of iron with charcoal & carb potash remained
