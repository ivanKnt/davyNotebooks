2 grs Cinchonia + 200 grs peroxide of Copper
in tube with Copper filings & asbestos - all previously
dried [unclear]shot[/unclear] . - gave 13.15 Cubic inches of Gas
of which [deletion]of[/deletion] 0.66 remained unabsorbed by Caustic
potash & was not diminished by Nitric oxide
being Nitrogen - hence the gas composed of
12.49 Carb. acid & 0.66 Nitrogen -
20 grs of Cinchonia therefore gives 124.9 C.I. Carb acid
