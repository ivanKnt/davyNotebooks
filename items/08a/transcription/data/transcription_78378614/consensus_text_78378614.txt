Carb amm & chloride of sulphur gradually brought together - sulphur
deposited and soluble salts containing Mur & Sul acid Amm no nit acid
& on being heated giving much ammonia with smell of prussic vapour a coloured substance
[unclear]also rose[/unclear] like sulphite of ammonia & sulphate [unclear]remad[/unclear] at last
The mixed salts in ether gave nothing soluble in alcohol a [unclear]solution[/unclear] [unclear]precipitating[/unclear]
by water (sulphur?) the solution contains muriate & sulphate of amm
when evap & heatd it yields amm & leaves a [unclear]caclareous[/unclear] residue - no
sulphate is taken up by the alcohol that remains & is soluble in wa-
ter Carb acid probably decomposed at same time as amm & cyanogen
formed.
Oct[superscript]r[/superscript]. 13. Bile from M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Howship -
Very thick & viscid nearly colourless - little odour - dries up
into a hard horny substance with but little diminution of volume -
dissolves in water giving a solution of albumen which coagulates by
heat acids & alcohol - Alcohol dissolves nothing out of this bile - no
[unclear]bitter[/unclear] substance or resin - nor is it alkaline Is more like strong white
of egg than any thing else.
- Chlorine passed over [deletion]heated[/deletion] [insertion]fuzed[/insertion] nitre - a little nitrous gas and
nitrous acid liberated which distilled over - salt took on a yellowish
tint but action not strong - On examination when cold salt
was found to be a mixture of nitre & chloride potassium , there
was [underline]no[/underline] chlorate of potassa formed
