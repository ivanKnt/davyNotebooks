1825. May. 3
Black, tarry substance from liquor by S.A washd with water
black [unclear]pulverised[/unclear] - burns with flame - little [unclear]odour[/unclear] of sul acid - burns
away entirely - in Alcohol
S A with either I or V first action by heat evolves only Sul
acid no carb acid or oxygene action seems to depend on hydrogen of com
pound taking oxygen from the S. A. & carbon being deposited
Ether into V [unclear]dissolves it readily[/unclear] - sol burns bright flame & Ether with
I. a very little condenses many vols of 1 vapour -
Vol oils dissolve V. absorb vapour of I rapidly
Fixed oil dissolve V absorb vapour of I rapidly
Alkaline sol pot does not sensibly dissolve V. - not does it dissolve
any vapour of I.
N A on IV in basin - not much action gradual browning - on IV in
tube & agitated gradually become brown & hot - by applying heat - Nitrous
acid came off mixed with brightly combustible Vapour after a time water
added - the remaining portion of oil slightly heavier than water and
of having a pungent odour - affecting the eyes also
Alcohol not very strong ( S.G. [lacuna] ) dissolves about 1 1/2 vols left
gas at 60°. not much more at 0° F. perhaps 2 vols or a little more
- the solution mixed with water resolves perhaps about half the gas again
