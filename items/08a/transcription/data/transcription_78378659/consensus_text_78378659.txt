[underline]1825. May. 5[superscript]th[/superscript][/underline]
Oleft gas about 16 vols with SA 1 vol over mercury in a tube -
put in 2 days ago. gas has gradually diminished and now only about
4 vols remain - the SA has become yellow in colour. but not black. no
charcoal deposited apparently - gas remaining burnt with a pale blue
flame like carb oxide or light hydro carb or little olefiant gas with [insertion][unclear]much[/unclear][/insertion] air
no sulphurous acid formed - no odour of it in S. A even when heated
except up to a certain point when sulphurous acid was developed
& charcoal also colouring the acid black - is apparently a compound of
SA & olefiant gas probably sulphuririous acid - saturated the
acid with lime filtered
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] vapour acted upon by SA nearly all absorbed. little
air from water it has stood over
1 vol vapour added to 3 vols air the 1 vol completely
separated by about 1/4 vol SA very nearly separated - none left
1 vol vapour to 7 Olef gas added about 1/3 vol sul acid.
[unclear]browning[/unclear] and on agitating immediate absorption of nearly 1 vol on
further agitation for 5 Minutes about 1 1/3 vol had been [unclear]absord[/unclear]
no vapour remaid - all left oleft gas -
8 vols oleft gas alone - added 1/3 vol SA - agitated for a minute
doubt ful if any absorption. hence may separate vapour pretty
well by SA from Oleft gas or from oil or coal gas - left till
the morning then about 2 vols absorbed
4 vols of coal gas from [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] over mercury with about 2 [unclear]1/2[/unclear] vol
SA apparently absorption of about 1 vol or 1/34 part sul acid
brownish - left till the morrow try this again doubtful
