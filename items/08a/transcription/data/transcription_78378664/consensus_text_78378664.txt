110 parts vapour - 5 1/5 alcohol absorbed whole - then 5 1/5 water -
evolved about 70 parts vapour 5 1/5 more alcohol absorbed until only 30 parts
nearly left.
Sol in alcohol treated with its vol water about half vapour evolved
this [unclear]dried[/unclear] &c absorbed by little SA readily - whitish precipitate formed - no
gas produced &c - [deletion]a[/deletion] no Suls acid - added water - [unclear]prec[/unclear] became very white
when settled
Much vapour added to little S.A great absorption [unclear]browning[/unclear] but no gas -
no production of Suls acid - - diluted thick brown acid - with water -
peculiar odour - added cream of lime filtered - added Carb acid - filtered
obtained a clear solution - to a part added sol baryta (earth) filtered
- evaporated to dryness - [insertion]became brown[/insertion] washed with NA to dissolve carb found from
excess acid found sul baryta formed - this in favour of Sul [unclear]various[/unclear] acid
- the other part evaporated for salt of lime
To about 30 vols of Oleft gas added 1 vol of N[superscript]o[/superscript]. IV it at first diminished
the vol of gas by absorbing it but now caused expansion by adding vapour the
expansion being about 1 1/4 vols - [unclear]remaining[/unclear] then [unclear]filtered[/unclear] by paper & then adding
SA to absorb vapour in Oleft gas 5 1/2 vols disappeared 5 1/2 - 1 1/4 = 4 1/4 which are
about the bulk of oleft gas absorbed by the 1 vol of N[superscript]o[/superscript]. IV. rough Expt but shews ab-
sorption takes place
