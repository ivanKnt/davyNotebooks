Fresh condensed liquor - distilled a portion into various vessels
cooled to 10° 0° &c not below 0°. - the very vol parts seems to be in
small quantity
[sketch of a glass tube bent in zig-zag form, different parts of the tube indicated by letters a, b, c, d ]
Obtained a portion of most volatile in
a tube formed as in margin - and containing a condensing guage at
[underline]a[/underline] it was of course closed - then collecting all the liquid at [underline]b[/underline]
[underline]c[/underline] & [underline]d[/underline] were put into mixture at 0°. & [underline]b[/underline] left in the air or warmd
by the hand - most vol portion then distilled over into [underline]c[/underline]. when about
1/6 had come over [underline]d[/underline] only was left in mixture at 0°. & [underline]c[/underline] brought
into the atmosphere - a second distillation took place and a portion ap
parently of the most vol passed into [underline]d[/underline]. - [underline]d[/underline] or the whole tube
being then raised to certain temperatures the pressure was noted
The Guage enclosed 12 parts of air at a temp of 11°. the mercury
stood at 6. about 2 atmospheres - at a temperature of 60°. mercury
at 2.8 parts - rather more than 4 atmospheres - these pressures [unclear]soon[/unclear]
diminished from reabsorption of most vol by more fixed portion &
consequent diminution of Elasticity - sometimes preserved [underline]b[/underline] & [underline]c[/underline] [unclear]warm[/unclear]
to diminish their solvent power
SA on glass rod a test of presence of these bodies in vapour
If condensing vessels not very cold and even then may weaken
instead of strengthening by distillation
