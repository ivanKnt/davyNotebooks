211 Vols of oil gas from Gazometer at Sutton Street with about 7
vol of SA over mercury in tube - by little agitation 28 vols [unclear]immediately[/unclear]
disappeared - in 5 minutes became 30 vols in about 6 hours diminution
43 vols
Again 100 vols of the oil gas with about [unclear]x[/unclear] 9 vols of Sul acid
over mercury by little agitation 17.5 vols immediately disappeared
and in 6 hours it had amounted to 20 vols
In both cases the gas left had its illuminating powers very
much diminished burning more like coal gas than oil gas
when issuing in a jet.
[horizontal rule]
1 vol N[superscript]o[/superscript]. IV thrown up into dry tube over mercury - then
1 vol of Oleft gas - (has been made some time perhaps therefore not
pure) added - on agitation absorption of about 2/3 of gas added
a second vol of Oleft gas added again absorption - about 1/2 of gas
a third vol added. still little absorption on agitation & even when
much gas thrown up so as to fill the tube upon agitation dimi-
nution took place - though vapour of substance must have expan
ded the atmosphere - Perhaps about 3 vols or 4 vols of Oleft gas
dissolved by the fluid
Coal gas - not very good - having stood over water some time added
a little of N[superscript]o[/superscript]. IV to it it then burnt with a brilliant dense flame
