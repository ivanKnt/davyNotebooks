Burnt a taper out in a portion of common air - then added a
little of liquor N[superscript]o[/superscript]. IV to this air over water in a few moments so
much vapour had risen as to make the mixture burn with brilliant
flame from wide mouthed aperture but scarcely burning at a
narrow aperture from force of current blowing it out - the ap-
pearance of flame that of oil gas .- The vol of air not moved
above 1/30 part at most by vapour probably not so much
estimated only by sight
