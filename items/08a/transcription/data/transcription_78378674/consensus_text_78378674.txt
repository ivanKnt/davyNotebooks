The bottle washed out with water - [unclear]eventually[/unclear] all blackness dis
appeared - a pale gray tint due to insol matter produced - added
water more & left in a jar to separate till monday - by monday
black[deletion][unclear]ness[/unclear][/deletion] oil had risen to the surface thick as treacle the greyness had
disappeared to a great extent - this black substance added to S A dissolved forming
deep brown sol as before which on adding water became a light brown [insertion]or grey[/insertion] opales-
cent mixture - black substance by pot in sol becomes more liquid losing its
tarry appearance but apparently no change except separation of little acid

* May. 16 had risen to the surface and on being separated appeared as a
pasty brown substance mixed with water when heated water flies off - part
runs as vapour - apparently like original oil & a black portion remains which
chars by further heat. S A dissolves it forming deep brown solution as it [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
do with original oil apparently Alkali in solution causes separation of the
water & consequent resumption of oily appearance by the body - Put on bibu-
lous paper - water is in same way separated
ยง The two fluids separated. The denser blacker portion was thick
like treacle - acid but by no means like S.A. - little water mixed [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
with it causing turbidness and making colour olive green - more water made the
colour lighter & more grey - much water of a light grey colour - this simply
due to separation of the matter which [unclear]afterwds converts[/unclear] as above into black
foam floating on top The aqueous solution filtered & neutralized by Soda
