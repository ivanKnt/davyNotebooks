Distilled & rectified a portion of condensed liquor from which most vol
part had been previously separated. Remnd in three portions noting tempe-
rature of vapour in retort when boiling as indication of volatility First portion
to 170° - Second to 210 - residue above [unclear]210[/unclear]
On redistilling the first portion much was found in it that required a heat [unclear]even[/unclear]
of 200° or more for its ebullition having been carried over with the more volatile part
on redistillg also the second portion - it now boiled even at 170 & 180 - volatile matter
having been held down by the more fixed Observed this very much in after rectifications
Ended after several rectifications by [unclear]securing[/unclear] in 8 portions
I up to 140°
II - 170°
III - 180
IV - 190
V - 200
VI - 210
VII - 220 very little then left it being
VIII - residue
the quantities about { 9
{ 10
no account being taken { 8
of those portions lost { 10
{ 8
by volatilization { 5
{ 5
{ 6
Still these portions indicated by their temperatures that they were mixtures but
the last portions were much more steady in their temperature than the first
Query May these effects be accounted for by mixtures of 2 kinds of matter of different vol
perhaps may be three
May 17 A portion of I in a tube with thermometer when boilg at
140° not above half gone - much remaind even at 170° and it rose to 180°
& 190° before all was volatilized
I rectified thermometer bulb in liquor about 2/3 passed over by 140° [insertion]A[/insertion]
and between that & 170° nearly the other third but a little remaind
even then
V & VI mixed & rectified - began to boil at 140°. full boil at
160° - at 184 - 6 a very constant point much distilled over
at 190° about two thirds gone over - Cooled that in retort thus distilled
