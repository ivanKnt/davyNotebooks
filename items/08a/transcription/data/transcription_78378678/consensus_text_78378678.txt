into another reciever - heat rose to 190° again immediately & before any
boiling of importance took place - between that & 200° about 4/5 of the residue
went over B
About equal parts of that at A before 140° and of that at B
between 190° & 210° mixed & then distilled - the results came over
not at 140 & 200 or thereabout but as follows
before 140° - 1.5 }
150° - 1.5 } these being about the proportions in which
160° - 1 } the products were recieved
170° - 1 }
180° - 1 }
190° - 0.8 }
210° - 0.8 }
Taking the 170° & putting it in a tube with a thermomenter it began
to boil at 130° & continued boiling & evaporating by 140° 150° 160° 170°
by which time most was gone but a little remained even at 180° & 185°
Have been distilling & redistilling many times today separa-
ting the products at every ten degrees & condensing in vessels surrounded
by ice - have of couse lost much of the more volatile portions -
The portions at low temperatures i.e 130 140 .150 &c seem [unclear]inconstant[/unclear]
in temperature boiling at variable points as a mixture would do. but about
184 or 189 there seems a pretty constant point & have obtained
a portion of fluid which appears to boil at that temperature &
not before
Thought there was a constant point about 170° but am
not very sure
A portion of that of 140 whilst volatilizing from end of a thin tube
left a solid crystalline substance which upon slight elevation of temperature
