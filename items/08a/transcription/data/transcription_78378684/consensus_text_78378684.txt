[unclear]Finish by[/unclear] having portions of fluid at
140°
150
160
170
176
180
184 - 6
190
200
210
Put all these in tubes into cool mixture at 0°.
140° became slightly turbid instantly clear by warmth of hand
150 - D[superscript]o[/superscript] -
160 rather more turbid D[superscript]o[/superscript] -
170 as first -
✓ 176 -partly crystallised - crystals round the sides fluid in the middle
180 - little turbid only like first
✓ 184 - 6 - quite solid & crystalline
✓ 190 - D[superscript]o[/superscript] -
200 - slightly turbid
210 - D[superscript]o[/superscript] -
on [unclear]probing[/unclear] the three with a cold glass rod. but a small quantty
of solid matter was found in 176°. to what there was in the other
two - 176 when broken up & left to rest at 0° let the crystals fall. &
a clear fluid floated above - when allowed to get warm. the crystals
[unclear]rapidly dissolved forming [/unclear] a solution dense & lying under the superior
fluid
184-6 & 190. hard like cold butter to glass rod. pressed much
of the crystals to the bottom. of the tubes in a [unclear]pellet[/unclear] - then was able to
pour off part of upper solution & thus divide it into two portions.
Crystals white transparent - dendritical
