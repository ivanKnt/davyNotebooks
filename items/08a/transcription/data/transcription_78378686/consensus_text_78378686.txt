Napthalene from coal tar &c boils at 420°
To a portion of 190° added Napthalene (which dissolved readily) until
the solution when cooled to 0° crystallised in part it did not crystal-
lise in appearance like [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] 186 or the others - then heated this
solution - it began to boil at 180°. boiled on heat slowly rising to 190°
vapour then ceased to come off & the thermometer rose to 300° and
nearly 400 yet boiling of the residue (the Napthalene) had not com
menced - taken from the heat & cooled when at about 60° the
whole solidified into Napthalene - hence [deletion]160[/deletion] 186° &c do not owe
their crystallisation at 0°. to Napthalene
The solid 190° of yesterday cooled to 0°. in a strong glass tube
then a single thickness of dry cold bibulous paper pressed upon
it by the closed end of another tube entering the first then a
crumpled pellet of bibulous paper pressed upon that, the whole
being retained at 0° in this way paper absorbed fluid portion - removed
it & introduced fresh paper in the same way - this repeated till pa-
per was no longer moistened by liquid & the solid part remaing was
dry & hard - withdrew paper - fused solid - recrystallised - repapered
it a little more removed but very little
Substance now a white crystalline solid not fuzing at 32°
fuzing at 45°. when cooled to 28°. readily crystallizing - crystals dendritial
- fluid limpid - not so limpid as the liquor at 190° - boils at 186°
- burns with dense white or smoky flame according to circumstances -
sol in Alcohol - prec by water - apparently very slightly sol in water
