Vapour of solid at 32° boils at 186°. strong enough to make
oxygen explosive to taper or electric spark
7.32 vols pure oxygen at 61°. F. - liquid admitted - in 10 minutes had become
8.0 vols = 7.32 + [deletion][unclear]8.7 8.[/unclear] vapour[/deletion] 0.68 - not very accurate - observ again
whole vol not quite 8 & vol of vessel & liquid about 0.1 - hence nearly
7.9 = 7.32 + 0.58
In Eudiometer another graduation 7.5 vols mixed oxygen & vapour at
61°. F. detonated by Electric spark became 6.25 nearly - then potash
let up absorbed Carb acid diminishing vol to 2.7. this proved to be
pure oxygen -
51 vols pure oxygen put with substance became 56.1 (rather more)
= 5.1 vols vapour or 1/11 of mixture vapour
Vapour with pure oxygen gas in bent tube. Oxygen vol estimated
at 57[deletion]x[/deletion]° F - May 21. Jar tube Mercury &c inmersd in water at 57°. F when
of uniform temperature place of gas & vapour marked & then a portion carefully
transferred into a tube for analysis by Eudiometer - Vols of Oxygen & Oxy &
vapour estimated by weight of mercury fillng space Oxygen alone 3617 gr or vols -
oxygen & Vapour 3856 - Hence oxygen 3617 - or 15.134} vols _ [underline]read on this line[/underline]

Oxygen gas with vapour SA let up gradually absorbd Substance & left
pure oxygen very little [unclear]colourng[/unclear] of S.A. very slight yellow
SA & fluid 186° mixed about 4 SA. 1 liquid by vol action but not vio-
lent & no heat apparenly evolved - no blackening - a slight yellow tint in acid
a portion of liquid remaind floating upon acid after agitation as if it were un-
acted upon by the acid perhaps half as much as original quantity
