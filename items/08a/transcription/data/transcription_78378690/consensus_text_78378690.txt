White substance from coal - not affected by heat - is crystalline in
structure - not affectd readily by acids by Sul acid (strong) & heat is gradually
dissolved - gritty crystals form in the acid & the acid poured into water
causes white precipitate - the filtered acid in drops on glass plate
gave in spontaneous evaporation crystals also
Dissolved in borax [unclear]hed[/unclear] by blow pipe - if a small quantity clear
& colourless - if in large quantity - clear hot - when cold opaque white -
Heated with caustic potassa apparently no action
Heated with Carb potassa strongly by for 40 minutes - the
Alkali washd out by water - light grey or yellow powder left
this appeard in MA grey clear solutn with it the sol from potash
by Sol Soda white - the Alkali washd off neutralisd by N A &
tested for SA gave plenty - the mineral in veins Sul baryta

This mixture detonatd on Eudiometr tube. 7.8 vols of mixture became 6.5
and these by potash diminished to 3.55 of pure oxygen
Vol of mixture - 7.8
became - 6.5
by potash - 3.55 oxygen
therefore detonated 4.25
