Mixed portions from 170 to 190 fluid at 0[superscript]o[/superscript] & distilled together slowly collecting
in two portions . heat [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] so that fluid was barely [unclear]simmering[/unclear] -
About 2/3 came off before or by 176[superscript]o[/superscript] and the rest by 180[superscript]o[/superscript] - these
portions when cooled to 0[superscript]o[/superscript] became slightly opalescent but nothing more - both
doubtless contain peculiar crystalline substance
Mixed the portions from 200[superscript]o[/superscript] to 220[superscript]o[/superscript] & above and distilled just at
simmering point - gave very little at 190[superscript]o[/superscript] - most at 200[superscript]o[/superscript] about one half
- another portion up to 210[superscript]o[/superscript] about one third - a portion up to 220 about one
sixth or rather less - some remained in the retort but little.
These portions appeared very constant comparatively in their boiling
points - they all became slightly turbid by cooling to 0 except 190[superscript]o[/superscript]
The most volatile & first portions from condensed liquor cooled to
0[superscript]o[/superscript]. did not become turbid or shew signs of solidification - there appear to be
a thin film of water deposited from this on the glass - soluble power perhaps
being diminished by cold.

Solid of liquid boil[unclear]g[/unclear] at 186 with SA in tubes over mercury
added more SA this [unclear]moing[/unclear] - seemed to cause no change portions before
unaffected - unaffected still
Solid product unacted upon bright & clear - freezing a little above 32[superscript]o[/superscript].-
crystalline - dendritical - white - lighter than water - sol in alcohol - sol at
first precipitated by water but [unclear]great[/unclear] excess apparently dissolving it
Liquid product part unacted upon - amber colour - lighter than water , not
freezing at 10[superscript]o[/superscript]. - sol in Alcohol prec by water - aromatic as camphor
