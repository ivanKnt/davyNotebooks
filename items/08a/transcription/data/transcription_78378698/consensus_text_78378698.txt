Tube altogether - 13.86 gr.  - liquor [unclear]first in[/unclear]
then Piece of Glass cut off - 9.56
Liquor tube & cork - 26 81
Cork - 21.11
Liquor & tube - 5. 70
SG of liquid ,8917 at 60[superscript]o[/superscript]
Liquor tube & piece - 15.26
Hence liquor alone - 1.40
Water & tube - 5.87
Hence Water alone - 1.57
This liquor & tube into apparatus as in margin
and water heated by steam - When in vapour the
bulk was estimated it was 2.2 c. i. at 200[superscript]o[/superscript] F
The volume of mercury from [underline]a[/underline] to [underline]b[/underline] being 4 3/8 inches and
The volume of water from [underline]b[/underline] to [underline]c[/underline] being 7 inches

hence 1.7725 c:i: weigh 1.4 gr or 110 c:i: weigh 81.16 gr at 60[superscript]o[/superscript].
S.G. nearly 38.
Some oxygen had vapour of substance added to it  - then transferred
to another vessel let up some of the mixture into detonating tube & passed spark
6.48 vols of vapour became 5.2 vols & these by potash diminishd
to 2.35 residual oxygen
A portion of same mixture over mercury equal to 6226 vols oil (sweet)
sent up diminution rapidly - in 40 minutes without agitation had become
5678 only by agitation & by further standing did not diminish hence vapour 548 vols
- Oil over Oxygen for same time & same manner - no diminution
