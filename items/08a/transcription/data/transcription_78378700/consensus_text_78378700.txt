Substance to N.A. little action redding of acid - cold froze the substance
which from nearly colourless liquid became light red solid- - colour disappered
on thawing - and [unclear]pourd[/unclear] off smelle[unclear]d[/unclear] very like Almonds - substance itself
smelld then like almonds - washed - became clear. & then white
on freezing -
Substance to Sol Potash, no immediate action though temperature
considerable
Substance in Carb pot. no action
Substance in chlorine in retort - little action in common light
much in sun light - dense white fumes - crystalline solid forming - chlo-
rine absorbed - none permittd to orter ultimately chlorine in excess
a solid crystalline matter something like perchloride carbon and
a fluid [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] here & there moisting the crystals - probabl the Mur Acid
& water of chlorine - opened retort - much Mur acid formed -
blew it out - substance had an odour something like per chloride of
carbon but more like artificial camphor
Crystals were volatile by heat melting first. had powerful
pungen odour (vapour) - not soluble in water - soluble in alcohol
& precipitated white by water - apparently not so sol in Alcohol as
perchloride carbon
Put water into retort it did not affect crystals or liquid hence
two compounds produced - Collected substance by spatula - pressed
it between paper to remove water - paper stained as if by oil - even
the fluid portion which it had in part absorbed - Paper in alcohol
gave a solution precipitating white, in water - Sublimed a portion
