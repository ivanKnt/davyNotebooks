1825. May 24
of solid part in a tube - it partly melted at moderate
heat but requird high heat for fusion of whole - not very
volatile - heat decomposed it causing evolution of MA Gas
& a charring of the fluid - then seemed to go on unaltered
X - substance when cold black & thick like treacle in appearance
but not solidifying at 60[superscript]o[/superscript] - after a while did solidify
The rest dissolved in alcohol not readily soluble - part less
so than the other part - solution hot - left in tube to cool
deposited crystals on cooling
May 25 & The black thick substance above distilled - first
portion readily came over recieved in tube pale yellow & fluid at 60[superscript]o[/superscript]
Second portion required higher heat - was thicker soon solidified & crystallised
a black charred mass remained - which on further heat left charcoal &c
Second portion heated volatile at high temp - combustible on paper with
much smoke - acts on tube apparently by chlorine - when passed through
hot tube decomposed depositing carbon & forming apparently - glass heated
much vapour strongly acts upon chloride of lead formed & probably carb
acid - chloride lead blackens by sul hy instantly
First portion ( a mixture ) heated in glass tube same decomposition by
heat & phenomena - no chlorine liberated & I think no M A.
liquid produced - black. heavier than water much - not affected appa-
rently by sol Alkaline Pot or Amm
The tube with Alkaline sol of yesterday - solution poured off &
evaporated left - adhesive yellow fluid not sol in water not [unclear]tasting[/unclear] at first
