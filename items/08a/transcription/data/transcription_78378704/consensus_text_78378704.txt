Action of heat as before
The crystals pressed on bibulous paper by Bramah - became a dry white

becoming coloured - [unclear]acid[/unclear] acting on the glass & passed over red hot glass deposited
charcoal but gave off no Chlorine or M.A. - fumes white and acrid
is combustible - smell of crystals something like perchloride carbon
- is by no means very soluble in Alcohol.
