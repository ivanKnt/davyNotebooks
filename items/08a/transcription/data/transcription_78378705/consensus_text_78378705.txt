Most vol vapour in a tube Olive oil added & agitated dissold
about 6 times its vol of the gas at common pressure & temp -
gave off gas under diminishd pressure of column of mercury
S A to same gas 410 vols SA [deletion]to[/deletion] & 47223 vols gas - [unclear]xx xxxxx[/unclear]
made into 9 portions each time a portion added an addition made to a residue
of gas unabsorbed by the oil - this at last amounted to 6142 vols it burnt with
a pale coal gas flame and was not acted upon by SA in 1/2 hour.-
was probably a product of action of gas & SA on each other 1/8 nearly not [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
The SA at last equalled 584 vols [unclear]So[/unclear] would have absorbed much
more gas - when put into water it became milky an oil separated
