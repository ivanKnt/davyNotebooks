Obtained more of the liquid from the water One the lar-
ger portion drawn from condenser whilst I was there at pressure
of about 25 or 28 atmospheres . The other taken out of a carboy
& brought away in consequence of its peculiar appearance
Distilled a part of the larger portion at temperatures from 32 to
60[superscript]o[/superscript] or 70[superscript]o[/superscript]. When vapour passed through tube at 0[superscript]o[/superscript] very little went
in to the mercurial trough uncondensed. Removed cold mixture
& allowed the vapour to go over uncondensed & be recied as gas
A globe being exhausted 39.9 c:i of this vapour estimate
at temp of 60 and Bar at 29.94 were admitted the globe had in-
creased in weight 22.4 gr - hence 100 c:i = 56.14 gr. S.G. 26.5 [unclear]nearly[/unclear]
Ascertain is C Inch measure correct
Observed during the distillation that there was not much of most
volatile substances present
Obserd also the appearance of the substance which crystallies at
0[superscript]o[/superscript]. but is very fusible & volatile & which comes over almost first thing
Distilled the rest of the liquor receiving the first & most volatile
into a cold tube & then collecting a second portion - when operation
[unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] heat perhaps 120[superscript]o[/superscript]: not much compared to the quantity
remaining
