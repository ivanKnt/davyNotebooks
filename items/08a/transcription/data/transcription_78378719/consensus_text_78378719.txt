Tube with oil over mercury . let most vol portion upon the
oil absorbs [underline]all[/underline] the vapour if it equals half the vol of vapour.
Retort prepared when exhausted held 27 c:i of air - exhausted & 20
c:i of most vol oil vapours let up - then added 10 c:i chlorine =
vapour - much heat - much fluid instantly formed - all colour of chlorine
gas - admitted 10 c:i more chlorine - again heated - more fluid -
colour disappeared - again 10 c:i chlorine - little heat yellow colour
[unclear]xxx xxx xxxx[/unclear] - 10 c:i more chlorine - deep colour - no heat - opend
stop cock full & 4 c:i more entered
20 c.i oil vapour & 44 c:i chlorine hence nearly equal vols
of oil vapour & chlorine unite into oil
ook some of the liquid out - was yellowish of a sweet taste but had
an aromatic taste also very like some other triple compounds of chlorine carbon
& hydrogen but unlike chloric ether - this evident & strongly so even when
