Submitted some of the vapour in a tube to 0[superscript]o[/superscript]. at common
pressure did not condense
Compressed a portion into a tube by a syringe & cooled it it
then condensed
Passed gas from Gordons Globe through a tube at 0[superscript]o[/superscript]. a little
condensation of solid substance but very small & might be aqueous
Distilled large portion of liquid receiving in 4 parts - the first up
to [deletion]xxx[/deletion] the second up to the third up to 200[superscript]o[/superscript]. the fourth what
remaind in the retort but not distilled
