Appears to me to be the same compound as that Cooper had &
considered as an Iodide of carbon. It appears to me to contain traces
of hydrogen for when passed over zinc an inflammable gas is evolved
A substance is obtained from it at a moderate heat which though it
flows & appears in colour & other characters to be iodine is not pure
iodine but a compound with carbon & perhaps hydrogen - when fused
it flows & runs at low temperatures evolving [underline]no[/underline] violet vapour

Could find no iodine in it either here or as hydroiodate - gave
