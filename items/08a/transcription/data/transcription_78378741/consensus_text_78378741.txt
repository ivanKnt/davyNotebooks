no sulphate formed
Some of the salts dry heated in a close tube - it becomes black evolved empy-
reumatic odour also water and fumes and the residue in water was alkaline
though apparently no sulphuret of potash had been formed for no smell of sul hydro
gen was produced by addition of Mur acid
The salt is [deletion]much[/deletion] more soluble in water than sulphate of potash when
solutions of the two are evaporated they decidedly differed in appearance &
manner of crystallizing the new salts taking up a silky appearance like
acetate of potash or mercury when dry. Especially if the salt be dried it was
also of a taste more bitter than the pure sul potash
Some of the precipitated salt of Baryta from * well washd with

Soda hence are baryta [unclear]salts[/unclear] free from combination The combination of barytes or its
salts with the carbo hydrogen seems very doubtful - Some of the precipitated salt

salt of baryta but on evaporation left a brown empyreumatic matter
There is perhaps a soluble substance formed in the first instance
which afterwards accompanies the acid, salts &c being soluble in water but not in
alcohol
