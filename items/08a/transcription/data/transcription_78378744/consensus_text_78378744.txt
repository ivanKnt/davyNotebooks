A hot saturated solution of the whole salts set aside to crystallise gave
next morng a basin containg [insertion][unclear]acicular[/unclear][/insertion] crystals in spherical groups occupying full half
the spaces of the solution originally the crystals were flat thin and somewhat [unclear]flocull[/unclear]
and somewhat resembled boracic acid in appearance . When the groups came to the
surface of the solution they had a white silvery silky appearance like some
kinds of mica - like boracic acid again and this increased when the crystals were
drained & put into the air & broken down they then contracted very much
the bulky groups occupying but a small space when [unclear]compressed[/unclear]
These silvery crystals when heated gave off but little water - they then
blackened a little- but did not fuze except at a high heat - did not flame
[deletion]Bottle No. 2.[/deletion] and only very little combustible [unclear]matter in[/unclear] then
put into water a feebly alkaline solution was obtained & a little charcoal
left - the solution evaporated & crystallised gave a crop of the common
crystals of sul potash transparent clear not silky & in prisms
Sol of Sul. pot crystallized in the same way the same appearance & quite
unlike the appearance of [underline]the salt[/underline]
Ether does not dissolve any thing from the mixed salt
It would appear that much common sul potash must be contained
in the salt and but little of any peculiar salt or compound yet is as
curious that the sulphate of potash cannot be separated by crystallg
but [deletion]rather[/deletion] has peculiar crystalline characters im[unclear]pressed[/unclear]in it?
