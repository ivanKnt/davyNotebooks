Bottle N[superscript]r[/superscript] 2 Vol liquid tube contains a black film pulverulent when
scraped and not like asphaltum it burnt with flame leavg pure charcoal - [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
later was dry. The alkali tube was very similar to the former containing
few crystals and containg also a sulphate but no small quantity Should later
however to try a similar experiment with less alkali & diluted - the fluid in
the bottle was of three [unclear]immiscible[/unclear] kinds the lowest the acid of a pale
brown colour above that a little of a deep black substance like fluid tar
and above that again a very dark brown liquid volatile inflammable and slightly
acid and apparently that part of the liquid left unchanged [deletion]in [/deletion]which most resembled
the original - There was not any or at least very [deletion]lit[/deletion] small [unclear]film[/unclear] of the thick black
almost solid substance found in Bottle N[superscript]o[/superscript]. 1. There was a good deal of
the most volatile perhaps 1 third of the original volume of fluid or even more
The most vol added to fresh S. A. and shaken miscible - after a few
minutes separated leaving a black acid below and floatg above was a small portion
of fluid resemblig that put on more acid added & the whole shaken up then after many
days did not separate and remaid black and a smell of Suls acid was slowly evolved on dilution acid
became slightly turbid on standing [unclear]S[/unclear] [underline][unclear]see on[/unclear] to[/underline] Sept. 24[superscript]th[/superscript]
The tarry substance added to water sank in it but after agitation &c much
acid washed out the bulk diminishd & nothig was left but a little lighter oil
& a few black floccule resembling charcoal
The acid diluted became very slightly turbid - filtered - neutralizd with
potash &c gave a salt which in part as lustre colour resembld the former but
it did not crystallise as readily in acicular crystals [deletion]but[/deletion] the tufts were very small
& more general yet not like sul potash - First crop of crystals [unclear]drd[/unclear] &c burnt
with odour became somewhat blackd more than former and became also more
alkaline - Obtaind a second crop of crystals in appearance like the first [unclear]but tried[/unclear]
