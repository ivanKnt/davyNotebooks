1825. Sept 15
Bottle No 9. with hay - on opening strong smell of acetic acid - added
water and agitated - the black part of the hay insoluble - filtered the acid - [unclear]neutraled[/unclear]
by potash filtd evaporated &c crystals obtd [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] & like sul potash but on being [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
discoloured & slightly very slight alkaline - Alcohol added to another liquor precipitated much salt
alcohol sol filtd off and mass became olive greenish & when dry gave an aqueous salt
being & hay alkaline ash - the salt in SA gave odour of acetic acid - it was an acetate of potash [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
with some more [unclear]soda[/unclear] & some brown [unclear]destructible[/unclear] matter [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] & smelling as if of an animal nature
The salt precipitated by alcohol disolved in water & recrystallized gave merely sulphate of potash
the small quantity of another liquor left from these first this evapo
rated to dryness gave a salt blackening more than former - becoming more alkaline
not cooling acetic acid with SA and blacking much when heated with SA - A little
piece of Acetate pot in SA readily evolved odour of S A and did not blacken
so much by heat - the white salt washed with Alcohol filterd & sol evaporated a
substance obtained - sol in water sol in alcohol - slightly acid from excess of [deletion]SA [/deletion] acid at first
when heatd fusing blacking burng with flame & [unclear]being[/unclear] black rendered strongly alkaline
- hence a combustible acid or salt - put into S A [underline]did not[/underline] evolve acetic acid odour
A Portion of the white salt washed several times in alcohol still when heatd -
discolord a little & became slighty alkaline The salt washd in alcohol filted [unclear]pass[/unclear]
& then dissolv in water & evptd The crystals had all the pearly aspect of the salt before
observed & did not resemble sulphate of potash hence salt [unclear]contains[/unclear] something powerfully
which causes it to assume this aspect
