Tubes [deletion]from[/deletion] of various products of condensed liquor which had been set
aside closed by corks  results obtaid at 140[superscript]o[/superscript] 150[superscript]o[/superscript] 176[superscript]o[/superscript] 200[superscript]o[/superscript]had had nearly
all evaporated & left a thick fluid below in appearance like castor oil [unclear]Cold[/unclear] of
[unclear]x[/unclear] residue it thick & tenacious almost like soft rosin warmth renders it
fluid if temperature raised on sandbath sudden action as if explosion but was
[unclear]dull[/unclear] & when heatd over mercury without air & by lamp did not take
place was probably only rapid & sudden boiling The heat deepd the colour very
much - sol potash acted upon it in part becoming coloured [deletion]and[/deletion] when filtd
it does not precipitate much by acid - a large portion was left unacted upon by
the alkali

Acid of Sept 17[superscript]th[/superscript] [unclear]S[/unclear] neutraled by potash & cryst[superscript]d[/superscript] gave a salt
pearly soft &c & exacly like the former large quantity of the solution left
to crystallise slowly
Another portion of the [deletion]acid[/deletion][insertion]salt[/insertion] put in florence flask with water to boil for
many hours to dissipate extraneous matter if possible - it boiled with froth
as if slightly saponaceous - on crystallng the crystals were pearly and in
fact unchanged
Sol sulphate of potash agitated with sol oil (boilg at 180[superscript]o[/superscript]) for some time
filtered evaporatd & crystallizd - but the crystals were of the usual kind -
are peculiary or combination
