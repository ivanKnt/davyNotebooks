Strong SA in a tube liquor boilg at 140[superscript]o[/superscript] added to it - much heat &
ebullition discolouration - [deletion]add[/deletion] cooled tube & contents - added more liquor until
it equalled 2 or 3 times the quantity of SA - left it for some days
Then it had formed a dark colourd mass at bottom of tube quite opaque
except in thin films. There were two substances but though they had spontaneously
separated they seemed miscible with each other The lighter fluid was of a deep
[unclear]inky[/unclear] purple colour in thin films and of consistg of [unclear]thin [/unclear]or coal tar -
a film exposed to air changed colour as the SA absorbed water - from [unclear]inky[/unclear]
purple it became fine violet - blue dull indigo tint - greenish blue - dark
green fine pale green which became more & more pale as it diluted [unclear]itself[/unclear]
On diluting a portion with water the same tints were produced
On adding about half its vol [insertion]water[/insertion] to the [unclear]lighter[/unclear] fluid & agitating they mixed perfly proding
a fine green deep colourd body almost opaque - on adding more water and either
agitating or leaving it alone to stand [deletion]the[/deletion] a separation took place a colourless heavy
solution of acid sank & upon it floated a deep green coloured oil - washed a
second time ( the previous water having been removd) with water the acid still remained *
The thicker portion was of a deep chocolate brown colour - like thick tar -
heavy - in water slowly changed the acid by degree separatg [deletion]and[/deletion] from it & the
colours being produced but not so finely as in the former instance [insertion]strong odour of sulphurous acid[/insertion] portions of the
two residua mixed & boiled with water for some time gave off aromatic
smell oil passed away and only brown film solid when cold remained
these burnt with flame were not soluble in Alcohol or water were soluble in
some of the vol liquid or in Volatiler oils formg brown solutions which by M A or
Sul acid became green like the original green solutions
