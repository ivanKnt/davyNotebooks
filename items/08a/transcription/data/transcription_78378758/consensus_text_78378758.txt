[unclear]xx & [/unclear][deletion]deep green[/deletion] clear & the oil deep green
Alcohol added to [unclear]some[/unclear] of the green oil produced a precipitate green at
first but becoming brown [unclear]and the[/unclear] solution filtered was of a faint yellowish [deletion][unclear]green[/unclear][/deletion]
colour whilst the precipitated portion was soft like honey and brown [unclear]It dissol[/unclear]
in [unclear]the vol[/unclear] liquor or in essential oil and on adding strong SA the solution formed [unclear]xxx[/unclear] brown became
green - when heated it boild off volatile oil evaporatd & a portion was left when [unclear]cold[/unclear]
[unclear]hard[/unclear] & solid but [unclear]xxxx xx xxxx[/unclear] all its oil & other [unclear]properties[/unclear] - further heat caused it to
burn with much smoke - nothing left - boiled in water for more time - [unclear]no solution but[/unclear]
a part was dissipated & a portion left like that produced by heat [insertion]not quite as[/insertion] hard [unclear]xxx[/unclear] but 
soluble [unclear]was heavier[/unclear] than water - [unclear]at first[/unclear] boiled without [unclear]oil in it[/unclear] but slightly [unclear]changed[/unclear]
its colour but not dissolving anything -
The [unclear]acid[/unclear] filtered after being diluted was colourless - on evaporation on sand bath
it when concentrated became dark coloured ([unclear]cooling[/unclear]) and afterwards reaction appeared to
take place & it became deep brown strong aromatic or camphor odour [unclear]rising[/unclear]
at the same time - The substance did not seem volatile here - [unclear]was this acid[/unclear]
heated still more charred & became quite black - and began to [unclear]rise &c on cool[/unclear]
and adding water - charcoal[unclear]was soluble[/unclear]
A portion of the [unclear]same[/unclear] acid put in flask & [unclear]it xxxx[/unclear] SA [unclear]xxxx xxxxx[/unclear]
of air pump - as it became concentrated there was [unclear]action[/unclear] & the whole
took a strong brown [unclear]colour and diluted with water the brown [unclear]went[/unclear] of a pale green colour
appeared - a [unclear]dark[/unclear] green solid matter [unclear]xxxx by xxxx xxx[/unclear] & [unclear]xxxxxx xxxx xxx[/unclear]
Another portion made into a potash salt gave pearly crystals
Another portion after long boiling - [deletion]by[/deletion] saturated with potash and  crys
tallized gave crystals not as pearly as should be the acid appears to have
been injured
