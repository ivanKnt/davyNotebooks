A little sulphur burnt in a dry bottle to produce Suls acid - a few drops of
volatile liquid poured in - in 24 hours very [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] brown shades produced hence
action & [unclear]explication[/unclear] of discolouration of liquid tubes in bottles by water shade [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
olive green
[underline]Alcoholic solution[/underline] yellow colour - Evaporated gave aromatic odour and
left slight olive green [insertion]brownish[/insertion] substance becoming green by water - dissolg in volatile products
& giving green or brown solution. and SA made it very green - quanty small
1 vol water added to alcoholic solution became turbid [insertion]& which[/insertion] but no precipitation and [unclear][deletion][insertion]gave the[/insertion][/deletion][/unclear]
no separation on standing some hours - 4 vols of water & a little potash added - [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
but no sign of separation
Some of alcoholic solution added to warm saturated solution of sulphate of
potash - slight turbidness - filtered & crystallized - crystals [unclear]comm[/unclear] sul potash
Dry chloride lime added to alcoholic solution
[underline]The green oil[/underline]. opaque & turbid colour dull dark apple green -
heated in tube little water separated & oil above became [insertion]very[/insertion] dark green & free from
turbidness - heated in open basin - [unclear]now cleared [/unclear]- became very dark green then
almost black - but by exposure to air and moisture returned to dark green
again - in this state [unclear]xxx[/unclear] in fixed & volatile oils & [unclear]it[/unclear] also volatile [unclear]liquor xxx[/unclear]
green solutions - reheated - again darkend through purple to black & by cooling
went back again - aromatic odour - combustible burning with flame -
is apparently very slightly acid but not to taste - a continued & higher heat
drives off something volatile - the substance darkeng in colour became dull
blue & this if cooled is hard & solid - when dissold in essential oil its resume
it green colour - by further heat after blackening charred & was decomposed
The volatile portion is colourless
