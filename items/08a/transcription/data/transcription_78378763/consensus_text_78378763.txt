substance left and on resolution colour not as pure as before - the substance altogether
very like residue from distillation of [unclear]green[/unclear] oil
1 Vol SA. 3 vols water mixed - latter volatile fluid (180[superscript]o[/superscript].) added &
left for several days. the oil gradually became brown & the acid remained
opalescent after long standing - hence had been action - and here [unclear]would[/unclear] not be
in consequence of attraction of and for water - saturated with potash filtered &
crystallised gave only common sulphate of potash , probably by longer
action would have given pearly crystals On Nov. 4. still crystals of same
kind - not pearly
Sol of pearly sul potash boild for some time with white [unclear]cement[/unclear] clay
then filtered & crystallised some pearly crystals apparently unchanged
Sept. 29[superscript]th[/superscript]
Potash dissold in Alcohol. [deletion]/[/deletion] volatile fluid added to it. left all night -
next mog the Alkali made a sulphate boild filtd & crystallized but
got no silky crystals
SA & [unclear]Native[/unclear] naptha - [unclear]deep[/unclear] browning - Some heat - not complete mixture
part of naptha floating - added water white precipitate - made it a sulphate filtered
crystallised gave merely sul pot - examined by heat nothing destructible not a
trace
[underline]SA & [unclear]native oil laurel[/unclear][/underline] - much heat - [unclear]redding[/unclear] brown deep brown - [unclear]xxxxxxxx xxxx[/unclear]
[unclear]xxxx[/unclear] mixture - acid became thick & viscid - much suls acid - added water gradually
separate of brown mass - made a sulphate of potash of it . cryst[superscript]d[/superscript] [insertion]slowly[/insertion] gave prismatic
crystals of Sul pot - not pearly - by rapid cooling gave crop very pearly and
then when heated charred but remaind neutral
