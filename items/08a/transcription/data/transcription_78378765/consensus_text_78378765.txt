. . . . [underline]oil [unclear]vitriol[/unclear] & oil turpentine[/underline] heat & action in the [unclear]xxx[/unclear] acid separated by water
neutralised & filtered[insertion] [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] residue was miscible with water[/insertion] gave crystals very silky - being & [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] - and [unclear]aftwards[/unclear] little alkaline
The turbid sols by boiling had on the surface a portion of insoluble matter resinous
[unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] sol in alcohol miscible again with water as before
Perhaps all products here [unclear]xxxx xxx[/unclear] examination - [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] salt with alcohol &c
[underline]SA & olive oil[/underline]added heat - deep brown colour - perfect union - added Water
[unclear]gelatinised [/unclear]and became white [insertion]odour of suls acid[/insertion] - by agitation frothy & saponaceous - little turbid but
no separation of oil - heated - strong odour of suls acid - by heat [unclear]a [unclear]red[/unclear] of
acid below & above a coagulum - separated the coagulum white - on more
water quite miscible on heatg [unclear]xxx[/unclear] formed emulsion put into a glass & left was
very frothy [insertion]when cold almost mucilagin[unclear]ous[/unclear][/insertion]. - acid neutralized by potash . salt in solution saponaceous - [unclear]crystd[/unclear]
crystals were not pearly and [unclear]aprl[/unclear] like sul pot - but had charred a little, mother liquor
evaporated & heated - charred much but remaind neutral. hence not [unclear]xxxxx xxxx[/unclear]
[underline]SA & Napthalene[/underline] - solution made [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] - red - on dilution slightly tinted
acid neutralized by potash - when sol pot sul when hot set aside - did not crystallize
evaporated a little more - at [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] after a time full of very silky crystals in tufts so that when [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
did not feel like silk but like thick [deletion]soft soap[/deletion] solute of soap by stir[unclear]rng[/unclear] the whole became
solid & felt like soft soap completely apparently [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] - reheated a portion & set it aside to recrystallize
slowly - dried another portn when heated it burnt with flame and left salt very little alkaline though
much charred - put alcohol upon a portion of original salt.-[insertion]the alcohol evaporatd left a crystalline sub[/insertion]
-stance [unclear]burng[/unclear] with much flame - leaving alkaline residuum a little - the substance [underline]soluble[/underline] in water
[underline]SA & Camphor[/underline] dissold slowly - [unclear]pearlish[/unclear] solution - water precipitated
white camphor - separated and neutralised - crystals not pearly but
brittle So were sul pot - mother liquor evaporatd to dryness  & heatd 
charred very little indeed
