crept up the sides & over the edges of vessel [unclear]vegetating[/unclear] very powerfully and more
than any other of the salts - the crystals on the bottom a little pearly - heated
charred but remaind neutral
- The solution set aside to crystallize had not cryst[superscript]d[/superscript] much in the [unclear]dish[/unclear] though [unclear]there[/unclear]
