crystals below - [unclear]crusts[/unclear] & crystals had began to creep up the side to the top & these were
very thick - and upon stirring the whole assumed the gelatinous or soapy feel
spoken off before - alcohol added made the whole white & opaque - filtered a solution
was obtained possessing properties of that below - seems to be a napthalate of
potash
The residue pressed & with residue of [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] expt. dried . dissolved in water
& crystallised gave almost [unclear]xxxx xx[/unclear] sul potash
The pearly & vegetative crystals in alcohol [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] - filtered - the salt separated
no longer [unclear]bud[/unclear] with flame - but charred only - The alcoholic solution evaporated
gave at last an aqueous solution crystalling on cooling [insertion]and [unclear]sligtly[/unclear] acid[/insertion] - evaporated to dryness a
crystalline [unclear]pearly[/unclear] substance left - soluble in water & alcohol . slightly acid - com
bustible with bright flame leaving strongly alkaline ash - heated in close tube
a little water [unclear]xxx[/unclear] crystalline body sol in alcohol - [underline]not[/underline] in water and
when [unclear]bing[/unclear] resembling Napthalene & alkaline [unclear]chaing[/unclear] ash left - Aqueous
solution of the substance not precipitated by nit lead - [unclear]mur[/unclear] baryta - nit copper
& nit of [unclear]silver[/unclear] except as [unclear]by little[/unclear] excess of SA in it - S. A did not separate
Napthaline from it
