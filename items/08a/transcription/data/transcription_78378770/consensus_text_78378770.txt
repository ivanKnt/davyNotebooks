Napthaline put into SA on the 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. in excess well shaken up & left till
today - solution red - above it a crystalline crust of Napthaline SA &c - A por-
tion of this solid crust heated became fluid - deep red - by cooling solid again by
further heat - dark olive green. little vapour no napthaline readily evidently held
[unclear]down[/unclear] when cold smell decidedly sulphurous [insertion]diluted no precipitation[/insertion] . rubbed with marble till neutral
filtered evaporated -
The fluid part not precipitable by water - the solid part in water dissolvd being little
particles of transparent napthaline - the diluted acid saturated with potash - sol precipitated
with alcohol & alcoholic solution evaporated gave a crystalline salt as before [unclear]soluble in water &[/unclear]
burng with flame & leaving strong alkaline ash - solution by mur bary [deletion]l[/deletion] very slight trace sul
baryta - salt tastes bitter
Another portion of [insertion]the[/insertion] dilute acid treatd with carb baryta [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] & filterd a solution
obtad precipitable by sul soda hence containg baryta [insertion]& no sul acid [/insertion] - evaporated gave salt which
burnt with bright flame - sol in water - alcohol - white crystalline - its ash black
& carbonaceous - the ash with MA & then S Soda did not give precipitate. it more resemble
in appearance a sulphate baryta than as expected a carbonate. try again
The sol of the baryta salt with SA preceptd of S B that little excess of the SA.

partially crystallised - by heat [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] inflammation &c. &c.
The potash salt redissolvd in Alcohol to separate sulphate perfectly
this solution evaporated to dryness - a portion dissolved & tested by MB gave [unclear]x[/unclear]
