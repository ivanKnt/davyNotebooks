sul Bary. The rest burnt on clean plat foil left very alkaline
ash which in water did not smell of Sul Hy. and by digestion with NA
gave a solution which [unclear]examined[/unclear] by M[unclear]A[/unclear] gave [underline]no[/underline] appearance of
Sul acid or Sul Baryta
Napthaline boiled in sol potash - then left all night - then saturated
by SA filterd - concentrated - treated with Alcohol & alcoholic solution
evaporated left very little residuum that [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] carbonaceous - and the
ash sul potash neutral
The S.A & Napthaline of the 1[superscript]st[/superscript] diluted much of the crystalline solid
portion dissolved besides the red SA. and only a little white Napthaline
left - further dilution no precipitation - solution filtered &. slightly brown but
clear . a little bitter to taste
A portion of this solution rubbed in a mortar with carb baryta (native
till neutral left to stand & then the clear solution filtered - it was
neutral to litmus & turmeric - not precipitated by Mur baryta - precipitd
abundantly by sul soda - hence contains baryta in solution - evaporated
in drops on glass plate left pearly rings slightly crystalline - resoluble in water
or in alcohol perfectly - readily in water - nitric acid added to a dry drop - then water
was complete solution - no sul bayta apparently - evaporated to dryness - white
salt - soluble in water & alcohol not in ether - nothing by ether - burns with flame
[unclear]charrg[/unclear] [underline]only[/underline] sul baryta [insertion]& charcoal[/insertion] - not carbonate - The aqueous solution [unclear]testd[/unclear] with NA no
precipitate - boiled with NMA. still no precipitate - little sul soda caused much precipitate
