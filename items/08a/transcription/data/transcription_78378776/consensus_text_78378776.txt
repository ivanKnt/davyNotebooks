About equal vols of Napthaline & SA. heated and agitated together in glass tube
- when cold solid portion & liquid portion examind apart - Solid portion in
water gave solution acid butter & left Napthaline solution saturated with potash
& treated with alcohol gave much salt very little sulphate - The acid or fluid part
now in water - no precipitation - treated with potash & alcohol gave very little
salt & much sul pot - scarcely any of the salt
Napthaline above dried - heated with more Sul Acid as before & then
solid substance in water & acid butter solution with native carb baryta - [unclear]soon[/unclear]

- half in tube by itself fused - no change - half in tube with almost 1/5 its
vol water heated [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] & agitated - two portions top colourless less small in
quantity - napthaline pure -  bottom deep red colour transparent - crys-
talline on cooling in radiating masses becoming solid throughout - this of
yellow brown colour though solution red. little more water - heated
was soluble but now brown - on cooling partly crystalline - by MB
contains SA. - More water added apparent precipitation of something -
no [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] fluid on cooling filtered gave a clear brown solution and a
little deposit in flaky crystals. these merely napthaline
