1821. Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 11
Baryta salt of Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 8[superscript]th[/superscript] very white & pure - heated in air [unclear]burnt[/unclear]
with much flame & left carbonaceous sul baryta this by heat [unclear]fusd[/unclear] a little
[unclear]sulphuret ph[unclear][/unclear] but no carb baryta - heated in tube little water ma-[/unclear]
[unclear]tter[/unclear] much napthaline with some tarry napthaline - [unclear]and vaporous tarr[/unclear]
but [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] & a tarry sulphate &c left - salt not sol in Napthal[unclear]ine[/unclear]
[insertion][unclear]salt of Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 10[/unclear][/insertion] - [deletion][unclear]saturated[/unclear][/deletion] sol in water [unclear]xxxx xx xxxx[/unclear] gave tufts of prismatic crystals
n glass very minute - a solutn of it precipitatd by SA until 
the [unclear]other[/unclear] liquor treated by Sul Soda & Mur baryta indicated scarcely any-
thing - the [unclear]xxxxx xxxx[/unclear] of baryta - Solution now red to litmus
is a [unclear]solutn of xxx xxxx[/unclear] evaporated & [unclear]xxxxtrated[/unclear] by sand bath -
[unclear]xxxx of a xxxx xxxxx[/unclear] - a portion put [unclear]over[/unclear] SA under bell glass _
an air pump - another portion evaporated ultimately bgan
to assume a brown colour when it was cooled became thick and
solid almost like [unclear]above[/unclear] but very deliquescent -  its crystalline nature
not observd - further heated melted it then began to fume
& char but did not willingly inflame
[underline]Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 12[superscript]th[/superscript][/underline]
[unclear]A cold[/unclear] saturated solution of salt of Baryta [unclear]not made to crystallize[/unclear]
spontaneously
The crystals left by yesterdays solution [unclear]collectd pressed & dried[/unclear]
white & glistening - by heat on foil flamed but very little but
burnt more like tinder - left merely sulphate of baryta & in
tube by heat gave off a little napthaline but not much & left
a very carbonaceous sulphate & [unclear]evolved[/unclear] fumes or smoke [unclear]empyreal[/unclear] 
[unclear]smoke[/unclear] & like that of vegetable matter decomposing - these crystals [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
