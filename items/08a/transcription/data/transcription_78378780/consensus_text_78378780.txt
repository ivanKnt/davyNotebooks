different to former - contain much less combustibe matter - boiled in water
dissolves but not in great quantity - very little dissolved when cold should
think scarcely any - for hot solution by cooling deposits abundantly - alco
hol dissolves it - salt is almost [unclear]tastless[/unclear] - whilst former salt has decided
bitter taste
The latter hot washings of the mixed sul & carb baryta of yesterday were
retained separate from the earlier and have been evaporated together
a solution containing a barytic salt is produced - it seems more crystalline
than former. its hot saturated solution forms crystalline film on surface
not so pearly as former salt , more like film on common salt - [deletion]evapo[/deletion]
[deletion]ratd to[/deletion] a drop of hot solution on glass deposited crystals looking hard & [unclear]gritty[/unclear]
like alum crystals in same circumstances.- evaporated to dryness -
gave a salt which burnt just like crystals -  tindery &c - probably
the same salt .
The solution from which the crystals deposited when evaporated
gave salt pearly &c & burning with flame like [unclear]first[/unclear] salt. It probably
only differs in the quantity of hydro carbon since both leave neutral
sul baryta by combustion
First baryta salt ( flaming salt) will bear a temperature of
at least 460[superscript]o[/superscript]. before it burns at 480[superscript]o[/superscript]. very slightly brown & retains naptha-
line - at about 520[superscript]o[/superscript]. Napthaline began to separate - at 540 browning
& vapour of Napthaline rising
