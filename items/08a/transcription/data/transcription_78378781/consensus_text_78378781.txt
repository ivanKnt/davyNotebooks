Barytes salts . N[superscript]o[/superscript]1. [insertion]thin tube[/insertion] or  flaming & No. 2 [insertion]thick tube[/insertion] or tindery - saturated soln
boilg made of both - on cooling [deletion]flame[/deletion] N[superscript]o[/superscript].1 1 nearly sold - N[superscript]o[/superscript].2 by no means [unclear]xx[/unclear]
[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] than these - these crystals in I filled about 2/3 of solution. those of N[superscript]o[/superscript].2 
about 1/4 of solution - Took equal portions of cold saturated solutions &
added equal quantities of [deletion]Mur[/deletion] Sul Soda in excess N[superscript]o[/superscript].1 far more precipitate
than N[superscript]o[/superscript]. 2 diluted N[superscript]o[/superscript].1  with water till shade apparently like N[superscript]o[/superscript].2.
It required 1 vol N[superscript]o[/superscript].1 & 4 vols water to reduce it to N[superscript]o[/superscript].2 Hence N[superscript]o[/superscript].1 or [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
salt much more sol in both [unclear]hot[/unclear] & cold water than N[superscript]o[/superscript].2
[unclear]And[/unclear] under air pump - examined - a soft solid - white - in the air
deliquescent rapidly - taste bitterest & acid not very acid - after taste metal-
lic like weak [unclear]alum or copper[/unclear] - & a little astringency - in a tube slight heat.
melted it without change - [insertion]melts below 212[superscript]o[/superscript][/insertion] on readily crystallizes from centres - and at last
becomes quite [unclear][insertion]x[/insertion][/unclear] solid - again heated more highly - water went off - and became a [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
[unclear]red hot[/unclear] still no sul acid evolved or any sensible [unclear]charrng[/unclear] - on cooling when
heated by MA very minute trace of Sul Acid - further heat - little Nap
thaline rose - more [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] oil red became deep brown and then as a sudden
action began and [unclear]spread[/unclear] and becoming quite black & opaque as if charcoal
[unclear]deposited -[/unclear] still no suls acid [unclear]evolvd[/unclear] - further heat - [unclear]then water and suls acid[/unclear]
charcoal formed ) and napthaline evolved - residue still [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] solidify
[unclear]when add[/unclear] with water gave [unclear]charcoal[/unclear] & a black solution which with Carb
baryta [unclear]xxxx gave[/unclear] sul baryta but also a little soluble matter still
The [unclear]solid acid[/unclear] dissolved in little water - sol precipitated by [unclear]mur[/unclear] baryta - [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
water dissolved precipitate - hence this acid decomposes mur baryta [unclear]formg[/unclear] powder
salt of baryta
[unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] acid & Napthaline [unclear]fuzed in a tube[/unclear] would not [unclear]mix in manganese[/unclear]
