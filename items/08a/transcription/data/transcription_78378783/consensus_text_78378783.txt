The acid left for a longer period under the reciever became
at last perfectly dry to appearance hard & brittle - remained white
there being no reaction of the SA at common temperatures

520 Oil vitriol - melted together & well shaken [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] a lamp for
about half an hour or 40 minutes - [unclear]xx[/unclear] & left to separate & cool
slowly [unclear]&[/unclear] when cold flask broken - containd red cake at top crystalline &c as before below
that same red with some solid granular particles floating [unclear]on its[/unclear] top these soluble in

Glacial [unclear]Phos[/unclear] acid & Napthaline . heated in tube Napthaline fuzed acid solid
little redding - agitatd &c then Napthaline poured off - in [unclear]mortar[/unclear] with water
Napthaline slightly acid - added Carb baryta when neutral filtd -solution gave
no trace of baryta to Sul Soda - evaporatd left mere film - very slight chang
A little water added to Glacial acid more to make strg solution - this heatd
& agitated with Napthaline - two fluids at top Napthaline crystalline when
cold. below dark opaque acid - acid thick not solid when cold - rubbed altogether
in mortar with carb baryta - could not render it [deletion]acid[/deletion][insertion]neutral[/insertion] to litmus though carb in
excess filtered - solution little acid to litmus - not to taste - tested by Sul soda little
baryta - evaporated left mere fibres - clearing slightly
