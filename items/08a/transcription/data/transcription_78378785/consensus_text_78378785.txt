light brown or colourless fluid probably sul acid - On cooling the upper portion
crystd first. then the lower the bottom portion did not crystallise at all
It was probably the absorption of this part which made the second lower portion
softer than the first. I find the bottoms of the first lower portion is in the same
state The fluid colourless was Sul Acid with little organic compounds
[deletion]Oct[superscript]r[/superscript].[/deletion] Now purified the two portions by fuzing each separately in tubes &
retaining them in fusion for some time - On opening tube of lighter substance when
cold the bottom was rejected as impure & added to mixed portion to be [unclear]repurified[/unclear]
On opening tubes of heavier substance the top was in like manner rejected and added
to [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] portions to be purified . . The different parts of heavier matter kept separate
some seeming to contain more acid than others. . This done several times
The [unclear]residuary[/unclear] pieces then all fused together when [deletion]they[/deletion][insertion]the two matters[/insertion] separated and were
[unclear]purified[/unclear] by [unclear]successive[/unclear] fusion as before

[underline]Substances examined[/underline]. Lighter substance - crystalline - dull red colour
[unclear]easily[/unclear] broken in mortar [unclear]ahesive[/unclear] as napthaline - white powder nearly -
on foil burns like napthaline leaving a little charcoal - fuzes first -
in tube by heat - colourless napthaline sublimes tasteless & - a black substance
is left [insertion]and soluble in water[/insertion], soluble in Napthaline - but by further heat giving a little napthaline
charcoal & suls acid - [underline]Substance[/underline] is highly [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] in [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] acid &
[unclear]bitterish[/unclear] astringent - Its quantity [underline]altogether[/underline] 600 grs nearly becomes
slightly turbid by heat between fuzing & boiling but clears as it cools towards fusion
point - Rubbd in water & filtd left residue which examd provd
to be pure Napthaline - filtd solution slightly acid - rubbd with Carb
baryta &c salt obtad [unclear]neutral[/unclear] evaporatd &c gave white salt
of baryta - which heated on plat foil did not fuzed flamed much
