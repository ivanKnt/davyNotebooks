A portion of heavier substance in tube with SA heated - at first floated on top
of SA but by agitation mixed perfectly forming deep red solution - left to
cool. - thickened but did not solidify - part added to water - whole dissolve
this rubbed with Carb baryta in water &c gave a [deletion][unclear]salt[/unclear][/deletion] mixture - [unclear]first[/unclear] washing
gave by evaporation . a salt burng with flame but I think not quite so
[unclear]Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 17.[/unclear] much as former or [underline]flaming salt.[/underline]. second washing ( or latter washings rather)
evaporated gave a salt which burnt tindery - was a little flame at one
moment . principally tindery salt - The [unclear]residuary[/unclear] sul & carb baryta - no
combustible matter in it.- Hence by further action of SA it means
that a compound with less napthaline is formed
Now work with [underline]heavier substance[/underline]. A solution of it made & filterd
Napthaline bg separatd by filter This [underline]impure acid[/underline]
[underline]Impure and - ammonia[/underline] in slight exess - evaporatd - brown colour - filtd
became clearer but [unclear]not[/unclear] colourless - evaporated to dryness - then alcohol added
filter - had readily dissolvd almost any thing - a little sulphate left on filter -
solution which passed though testd by Mur [unclear]bay[/unclear] no SA. lower salt pure -
- evaporatd it by little warmth in the air - became acid but was dry
- did not deliquesce by exposure to air - a little desoled in strong
ammonia & then exposed to air became dry & slighty acid - [insertion][unclear]dry[/unclear][/insertion] on litmus paper very acid
taste of salt . saline & cooling - heated on foil fused blackend - burnt with
flame & left a charcoal [unclear]with[/unclear] acid sul ammonia which by further heat
had the sulphate decomposd in usual way & then ash [unclear]intesely[/unclear] [unclear]bunt[/unclear] away
Portion of solution dried under air pump - sligtly or imperfectly crystalline .-
brownish - dry. apparently not deliquescent - dissolves readily in water
- acid to litmus - burns &c as before - A very ammon[unclear]iacal[/unclear] solution litmus paper
in it before dried at common temperatures had become acid  powerfully to the litmus the
sol itself -. by standing became acid - Potash added to sol salt [unclear]liberate[/unclear] air  of [unclear]former[/unclear] salt of potash [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
