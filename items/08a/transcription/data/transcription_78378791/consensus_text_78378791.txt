becoming pearly in air - sol in water - sol contains no sul [deletion]baryta[/deletion] acid to MB. - solid salt feels like
greasy wax soft but brittle sligh[unclear]tly[/unclear] - exposed to air combines dry - [insertion]solution in air dries up hence not [unclear]deliquescent[/unclear][/insertion] -- is slightly brown- the last washings
with alcohol gave a much whiter salt - salt is neutral - bitter & saline to taste - heated on foil

Having salt of baryta - in atmosphere of chlorine some air - no action
in 6 hours - salt unchanged - still sol in water &c & c
[underline]Impure acid neut by Soda[/underline] - solution heated evaporated & treated
with alcohol - scarcely any sulphate - solutions alcoholic merely gave tufts
of crystals small resembling those of potash - evaporated to dryness - salt exposed to air
did not deliquesce- solution exposed to air became dry & [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] - taste bitterish not
very strong [insertion]slightly [unclear]persistent[/unclear] metallic taste[/insertion] - heated on foil blackens a little - melts [unclear]puffs up[/unclear] burns
with flame & leaves a carbonaceous alkaline subst soda - heated in
tube - yields a little water - blackens - decomposes fumes highly combustible
- a little napthaline evolved but I think not so much as with baryta
as potash salt - this further [unclear]action[/unclear] & suls acid gas evolved will smell
of sul hydrogen - query soluble results after strongly heating the residue of
sul which escapes not a true sulphuret perhaps a carbonate in part
