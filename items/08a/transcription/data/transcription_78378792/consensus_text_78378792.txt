[underline]Impure acid rubbd with Magnesia[/underline] became neutral - evaporated - dry salt in
Alcohol - filted - sol clear - slight colour - by spontaneous evap on glass plate gave separate
tufts formed of radiating crystals - [unclear]over[/unclear] minute - sol evaporated to dryness by heat gave
whitish salt - which in foil by heat - blackened - [unclear]fuzed[/unclear] - melts & burnt with flame
fuzing as it burnt - left black ashes. [underline]alkaline to[/underline] turmeric paper - ash [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] gave
white ash also slightly alkaline to turmeric paper - Are these effects due to pure Magnesia
or is some alkali present - In tube by heat - water napthaline & [unclear]empyreumatic[/unclear]
matter rose - black ash &c aqueous oil by spontaneous evap left [unclear]strata[/unclear] of small
radiatd spheres resemblg zeolite & pearlite a little though gloss & about it an abundant vegetation
beautifully relieved & prominent & highly crystalline all day (quite) - Tasted
salt bitter [unclear]not eminently so[/unclear]
180 grs of solid napthaline acid in water by rubbg it gave filtred acid [unclear]solution[/unclear]
& left 50 gr of Napthaline
[underline]Impure Acid & carb lime[/underline] - rubbd tgether till neutral - a little concentratd then alcohol
& filtratn a solution obtaind - which by evaporation gave solid salt of lime - is moderatly
sol in Alcohol in water not so soluble but by boilg is perfectly soluble - Alcoholic
solution in glass left crystalline solid - aqueous solution in glass a white thick
film which by glass slightly crystalline [insertion]by slow evaporatn [unclear]size[/unclear] of crysta[unclear]ls[/unclear] small [underline]& [unclear]size[/unclear] of vegetation[/underline] . dry all.[/insertion] - taste of salt bitter somethg like sul mag.
[deletion]III[/deletion] an after metallic taste slight - Heatd on foil . blackened burnd without
change of form with bright flame - left black residue becomg white by
degrees & proving to be sulphate of lime with little sulphuret lime
In tube by heat . little water - blacking thus Napthaline - then more action
denser fumes - yellow deposit oil [unclear]empyreumatic[/unclear] - then suls acid gas of a pungent smell
of some kind left black ash &c
