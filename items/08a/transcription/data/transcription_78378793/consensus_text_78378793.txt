[underline]Impure acid & carb [unclear]strontian native[/unclear][/underline] - rubbed together &c aqueous solution evaporatd
gave a dry white salt. - drops of aqueous solution om glass plate evaporated
gave white ring & [unclear]fibres[/unclear] almost opaque by reflected light not visibly crystalline -
unchanging [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] by exposure to air - slow evaporation gave
dry salt - on plat foil - heatd - did not fuse [unclear]&[/unclear] burnt with bright flame [unclear]smoke[/unclear] &c
no tinge of red - left carbon & [deletion]th[/deletion] sulphate structure - In tube like other
salts.
[underline]Iron filings in impure acid [/underline]. action & liberation of hydrogen heated a little
& obtaind a solution . greenish colour brown a little acid to litmus - which
on cooling deposited a white salt of Iron crystalline but scarcely perceptible -
The solution heated & separatd from iron - part left in tube to cool &
deposit . drop of solution white by [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] forms pot. becoming blue
in air - drops evaporatd in air - spontaneously soon became [unclear]covered[/unclear]
with film by slow evap left layer of globular concretions - were slightly brown [insertion]water added gave solution almost white by [unclear]precp[/unclear] pot.[/insertion]globular concretions - were slightly brown by heat . left similar
substance which on foil burnt with flame without fusion left charring ash which
[deletion][unclear]beco[/unclear][/deletion] gave suls acid & left per ox iron -. taste of salt [unclear]ferruginous[/unclear] not bitter I think
Alcohol 2 vols added to 1 vol sol caused turbidness - filtered - drop of solution
on glass by heat left [insertion]left [unclear]till morg[/unclear][/insertion] crystalline film - white - alcoholic solution [unclear]clear[/unclear]. white by
[unclear]ferr- precip[/unclear] potash becoming blue by degrees - evaporated to dryness by heat -
a little red oxide appeared floating - dissolved in water - treated by litmus slightly acid - by
M B. precipitated Sul baryta - left solution till morning - drops of Alco
holic solution left till Morg - film with aggregations here & there - [unclear]light[/unclear]
yellowish colour dissolved in water & treated by P. R more blue than crop aqueous sol
[unclear]xxxx[/unclear] &c a result probably of presence of a little per salt & per acid - must operate on
a sulphuret & obtain a pure proto salt of Iron
The proto salt seems considerably sol in water
