[underline]Protonit mercury[/underline] precipitated by carb soda - evapted &c. then whilst
moist put in great excess into [underline]sol of impure acid[/underline] - heated - evolution
of some carb acid - solution slightly acid - potash [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] black ox mercury - by
M Bay. S.A present - on evaporating a little became by dgrees tinted
& filmy - by further heat a dry yellow solid - odour rises - this
solid soluble in water forg yellow solution - by further heat
colour increased to brown & still higher on plat foil made it
burn like tinder & nothing remaind ultimately.
Another portion of solution when evaporated put in drops
on a glass plate - immediately as cooled became turbid - filmy left
till morng then small accumulations of salt as if of spherical form but it
very decidedly crystalline - were dry - hence though acid salt not [unclear]Mur[/unclear] acid
Another portion put in basin under air pump to evaporate
left a white crystalline salt - in places yellow as if a little [unclear]per[/unclear] salt or [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
mixed with it - alcohol upon it - evaed left left a yellow salt - filted - yellow [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
on foil. burnt with little flame - tindery - all dissipated by more heat -
Alcoholic sol on glass plate by concentration [unclear]x[/unclear]
dryness by heat gave yellow substance - this with water yellow solution of
more insol matter - the yellow solution wth mur acid gave calomel
[underline]Per [deletion]ox[/deletion] [insertion]nit[/insertion] mcry [unclear]forms[/unclear][/underline] by pot . yellow sold washd & whilst moist
digested with [underline]impure acid solution[/underline] - boild some time - still acid - filtrd
evaporated - became [unclear]pink[/unclear] - very acid but by pot gave a little per oxide . drops on
glass plate gave [deletion]dry[/deletion] [insertion]xxxxx[/insertion] crystalline fibres - evap to dryness by heat left yellow substance
which brittle in air [deletion]did[/deletion] [insertion]& became sticky[/insertion] [deletion]did[/deletion] attracted water - on foil fused black[unclear]nd[/unclear] burnt with flame & left
no residuum - in tube gave water vapour napthaline - mercury & empyreumatic
stain & left carbon - yellow substance in water gave yellow solution & yellow
sediment - acid evidently in excess . in solution - hence not dry air over
Evap under air pump yellow solid - [unclear]deliquest[/unclear] from excess of acid
