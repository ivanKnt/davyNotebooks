Sul Copper + Carb soda - carb copper [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] - digestd in impure acid
sol filtd - acid considerably to litmus - acid [unclear]cupreous[/unclear] taste - greenish - on glass
plate very thick crystalline crust . radiated [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] - is very soluble in water - solubility considerable
dry - on foil becomes yellow brown . [unclear]decrepitates[/unclear] considerably - blackens
fuzes burnt with flame left mixture of charcoal copper &c -
Alcohol added to salt - solution obtained . still acid - set aside in drops &
portion to crystallise - gave radiated agglomerations over space of drop [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
by edge. decidedly crystalline - dry. . in capsule left dry [unclear]crustation[/unclear] result-
white or very nearly so
Sul Nickel + Carb Soda - carbonate [unclear]washd[/unclear] &c digestd in impure
acid - gave green solution filterd - boiled - became a little turbid - evap to
dryness - added alcohol - [deletion]blue[/deletion] [insertion]green[/insertion] solution & white insoluble matter the latter
heated on foil burnt tindery but did not char [insertion]left white mass[/insertion] not char . too little [insertion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] in water[/insertion] to examine nature
The solution in drops on glass. gave hmispherical crystalline tufts in
films testd by MB. no S.A. - evap to dryness
gave salts by heat yellow then brown - not fuzing - charring burning with [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
flame - [unclear]leing[/unclear] black ash which by heat & air gave suls acid & left
oxide nickel - In water as former salts. Aqueous solution hot coold
[unclear]suddenly filld[/unclear] with minute acicular crystals -- On plate of glass gave [unclear]crystallizd[/unclear]
resemblg that of alcohol not so distinct - in greater quantity - more [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] but much
