Flaming salt tretd with N M Acid - similar result to [unclear]xxx[/unclear] of N A - is imp -
perfect.-
Flaming salt of Baryta - is decidedly neutral to litmus not slightest ap-
pearance of acid - yet heatd in glass tube - suls acid gas as decidedly
rises . after Napthaline - the residue from tube heated in air till white
ash produced then digestd in M A gave little sul by smell . littl N A added boild 
diluted clear liquor testd containd a little baryta - hence suls acid may have
unitd from [unclear]decompositn[/unclear] of Sul baryta by charcoal & [unclear]i: a:[/unclear].
Flaming salt of baryta mixed with little carb baryta gave [underline] no [/underline]acid vapours
when decomposed in tube by heat
Sulphur & flaming salt baryta mixed no particular action
151.4  gr of dry napthali[unclear]c[/unclear] acid cryst[superscript]d[/superscript]- &c. &c. 460 native carbonate
baryta - 360 nit washd hence. 100 gr carb mixed with it in mortar - basin
2061 - 39.6 gr napthaline separated - hence 151.4 - 39.6 = 111 .8
acid enters into combination - insol residue well washed & dried at
2[deletion]3[/deletion]12[superscript]o[/superscript]. = 62.2 gr. by heat it charred burnd a little tindery but when
white = 59.9 gr hence loss by buing 2.3 gr.- the residue in water alkaline
from baryta probably sul baryta dissolved added a little N A. slight smell of sul hy.
as carbonate dissold - added weak NA until effervescence ceased 27 gr
sul baryta left
the salt evaporatd to dryness gave 117 gr. - was dried in a sand bath till
it lost no more weight . this weighed & bottled up
