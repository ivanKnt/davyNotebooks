[unclear]Get[/unclear] quantity of napthaline in impure solid acid
- sulphate of baryta and consequently -
- sul acid in solid impure acid - then by subtraction
- peculiar acid (dry) in crystalline impure acid
- salt of baryta it will make - this the
- quantity of baryta }
- quantity of acid and consequently }
- quantity of water in salt. - }
This ascerted yet - quantity of sul acid produced from given weight of salt
and - quantity of [unclear]baryty[/unclear] also
this quantity of carbon - and
quantity of hydrogen .
Sol of the pure acid from baryta acted upon by voltaic battery
gas from both poles Neg pole pure hy pas pole oxygen only. but the
solution became of a deep yellow colour at [underline]positive[/underline] pole & after
some time whole became yellow - On testing found SA had been evold
this had produced yellow colour by its action on the hydro-carbon - [unclear]Evaporated[/unclear]
spontaneously made it of a deep brown colour
Sol salt baryta in voltaic circuit - similar results - becomg
yellow &c by degrees
Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 24 Clean new [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] basin. dry & warm weighd 2055.4 gr
put when cold into cold water for 20 minutes wiped dry had increased to [unclear]20xx[/unclear]
in 60' more became 2073.4 - In 3[superscript]h[/superscript]. 20' from first . 2085 - by exposure
