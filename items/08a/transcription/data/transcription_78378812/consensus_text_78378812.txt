napthaline substance below the heavy substance. 2 portions of this taken
one from top another from bottom & examined as to relative quantity of
first & second acid by making barytic salts = gave apparently equal proportions
of Napthaline - top portion gave hardly a trace of tindery salt - residuum burnt
tindery hence some salt there tindery. bottom also gave much flaming salt & but
little tindery salt perhaps a little more than top portion but quite [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
Salt of baryta flaming - dried in tube at 350[superscript]o[/superscript] to 400[superscript]o[/superscript] for 40 mins
then tube cooled salt had not decomposed or suffd - then heated Nap
thaline now pure then carbonization &c &c & fumes very little traces of

38 gr of the same bar salt mixed with 20 gr native carb in powder
heat in crucible till white a little nit amm added but [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] smell
