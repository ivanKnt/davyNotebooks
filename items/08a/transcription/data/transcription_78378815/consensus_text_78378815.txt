A portion of the same flaming salt of baryta dried in bath at temp of 340[superscript]o[/superscript]
400[superscript]o[/superscript] 420 : for 2 hours - 17 gr of dried salt burnt in crucible gave
7.36 gr of sulphate baryta after action of SA - hence 9.64 combustible or
water
Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 28.
4.2 gr [underline]dried[/underline] baryta salt flaming exposed to air became 4.4 by Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]
4[superscript]th[/superscript].
Cold saturated sol of baryta salt set aside Oct[superscript]r[/superscript]. 12[superscript]th[/superscript]. covered with paper today
Oct[superscript]r[/superscript]. 28. examnd several groups of crystals in remaing solution . the crystals [unclear]decidedly[/unclear]
formed transparent &c but not perfect enough to give shape but yet obtaind & [unclear]pressd[/unclear]
out & burnt on plat foil gave scarcely any flame but burnt [underline]tindery[/underline].
Flaming salt baryta in tube & metallic bath at 480[superscript]o[/superscript]. 500[superscript]o[/superscript] for
half hour. water driven off no napthaline sublimed - no blacking or
discolouration - 480[superscript]o[/superscript]. browns a card and paper & makes them quite
brittle - at 570[superscript]o[/superscript] began to brown - but very little napthaline had risen &
salt in this state burnt with much flame as before apparently - 
the second day salt also began to char at 570[superscript]o[/superscript]. left at 570. 560 for
half hour no further change. then heatd by opened lamp no water rose - a
little napthaline ( very little indeed ) - fumes blacking &c - First salts
also left same time - this heatd in tube - plenty napthaline durg
decomposition - hence not convert flaming salt into tindery by heat
hence also hydro carbon held by strong power
