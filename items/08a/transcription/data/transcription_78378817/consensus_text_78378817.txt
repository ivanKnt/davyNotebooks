Some napthaline & Sul acid rubbed together in a mortar cold &
left exposed to air for some hours . treated for baryta salts gave a little
flaming salt - very little of tindery salt - indeed very little altogether - but
no advantage in proportion of tindery salt
Some Napthaline rubbed with SA then put into a tube heatd
a little more napthaline add heatd & agitated - the proportions such
that a homogeneous red fluid resultd remaining fluid but thick
like treacle when cold. . this mixture was not heatd longer than sufficient to
combine substances - examined for salts in usual way gave very much flaming
salt & scarcely any of tindery salt
