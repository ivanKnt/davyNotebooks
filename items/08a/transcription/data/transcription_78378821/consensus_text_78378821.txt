Dismounted the contents about where the piece lay taken up [unclear]put in a[/unclear]mixed
with some per oxide copper & tube refitted again
Tube chargd 525.3 gr - not quite 0.3 ci of gas or air ob
tained & potash added to this
loss of wegt in tube hardly visible - when heatd [unclear]ashes xxx[/unclear] a little
water came off - probably. from oxide copper put in unheated - this
amountd to 0.2 grains

The tube allowd to cool then reheatd to ascertain how much
air would be found out by more expansion - it equalld 0.1 c:i:
the three tenths above had probably been expelled by the vapour
of the water of the oxide of copper
