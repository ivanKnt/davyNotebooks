short wider - 2.47 -} {- 0.26 the first [insertion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/insertion]
so loss of weight [deletion]tu[/deletion] in tube - 3.88 gr
Water driven off equalld 1.31 gr
Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 19th [/superscript] 1.45 pure caoutchouc
tube & contents 508.74 - drying tube 57.2 increasd 0.04 grs
loss - of tube - 4.7 gr - on being heatd - loss 1.5 water
Gas. in short wide tube (the first) = 7 c:i } {  0.40 c.i

Nov 21[superscript]st[/superscript]. contents of tube taken out - repulvered & mixed [unclear]repacked[/unclear] &
reheated. 0.21 c:i of gas came over - tube allowed to become quite
cold but its contents &c not disturbed then reheated &c gave off [unclear]0.2[/unclear]
hence this the quantity thrown out by expansion
Pure caoutchouc heated in a tube melted & then distilled over again
& again without any change - by higher (red) heat vapour [unclear]decomposd[/unclear]
- the fluid with oxcopper distild from it without change except at
dull red heat - fluid on cooling became thicker & tenacious
