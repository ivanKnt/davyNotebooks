All the products of distillation yesterday - [deletion]consider[/deletion]fluid not thick or
tenacious - the most vol and fluid - at 0[superscript]o[/superscript] 1. 2. 3. quite fluid - 4 a little
[insertion]thicker. 5. like thin tar perhaps[/insertion]Slip of pure caoutchouc in very strong sol pot. boiled. - no action except
production of pearly or [unclear]tendinous[/unclear] surface on caoutchouc - no softning or
swelling - a slip in N A pure - heated caused evolution of nitrous acid &
at last a yellow solution resulted - which on cooling became turbid - water
precipitated a yellow body - the acid sol evaporated left a bright ches
nut brown substance - insoluble in water - soluble in part in Alcohol sol from
potash by water - alcoholic sol on glass plate left
Spirit diluted until pure caoutchouc floatd in it . then compound with
water . Water 390.42 - diluted spirit 360.18.-  S.G of Alcohol . 0.925
hence S. G pure caoutchouc 0.925
Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 24 Pressure in Bramah does not alter its density but by redupli
cation renders it [unclear]rigid[/unclear]
Caoutchouc with sulphur peculiar results of decomposition by
heat much gas containg sulphur carbon & hydrogen - a mixture of
different [unclear]things[/unclear] - solit carbon &c and much charcoal left in tube
this not left if cautchouc distilld per se. to be examined
The products receivd over water gave much sul hydrogen but
no other [underline]permanent [/underline]gas the sulphur in this case being in
considerable excess. - sulphur & carbon were left in vessel (retort)
Caoutchouc with deficiency of sulphur gave sul hydrogen -
vol compd of carb & hydrogen being bright = other more fixed compounds be
then from caoutchouc alone & charcoal remaind - the sulphur [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
simply to take hydrogen
Sulphur a little in N[superscript]o[/superscript]. IVI little heat it dissolved - or [unclear]nearly[/unclear]
