Barytic salts from S A & Napthaline - Solutions (saturated)
that have been put by for above a month - All of these solutions of
flaming salt - in some crystals - spherical groups somethg resembling aggre-
gations of [unclear]wavellite[/unclear] In other groups of sharp acicular or prismatic
crystal - transparent brittle [unclear]&c[/unclear] - All of these burnt tindery and
with very little flame - is the second salt.

Experiments on Induction Electric & Electromagnetic
Two copper wires were tied close together a thickness of paper
only interve[unclear]ang[/unclear] for a length of five feet One of them was made
the connecting were of a battery 40 [unclear]pr[/unclear] of plates 4 inch square in
rather weak action and the ends of the other were connected
with a galvanometer no effects however upon its needle could
be observed consequently no visible proofs of induction by the wire
through which the current was passing upon its neighbour
could this way be [unclear]perceived[/unclear]
In reference to certain views with respect to the axis of
action the connecting wire of the battery passed through the centre
of a helix but no results- Again a helix being in [unclear]connection[/unclear][insertion]connection[/insertion]
with the poles of the pile [deletion]the[/deletion] a straight wire [unclear]occupying[/unclear] [/unclear] [insertion]occupying[/insertion] [/insertion] its
axis was connectd with the galvanometer but no apparent effects
The galvanometer was not a very delicate one -
If magnetic action be simply electrical action as M Ampere
considers it this magnetic induction must be electrical induction
