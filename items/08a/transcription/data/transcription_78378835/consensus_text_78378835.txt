and M Aragos experiments must depend upon induced electrical
action Hence electrical poles or surfaces ought to produce similar
effects for though the electricity will not be in such quantity
and not in motion still it has sufficient attractive & repulsive
powers and it appears to me that the mere difference of motion or
rest as aspects the electricity in the inducing body will not explain
[deletion]any difference[/deletion] such [unclear]retention[/unclear] of the induced state in one case
(magnetism) and such resignation of it in the other ( the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
