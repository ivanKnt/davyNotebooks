Impure Palladium
Dissolved in N M Acid left a portion not soluble
in the acid except with great difficulty. This ([underline]a[/underline])
The solution evaporated to dryness - water added - the solution
obtained [insertion](e)[/insertion] brown and an insoluble portion left (b).
A part of the solution precipitated by prussiate of [unclear]mercury[/unclear]
the sol palladium being in excess the prussiate precipitated
collected washed dried and decomposed by heat giving
Palladium (c). The washings collected evaporated when dry
gave a mixture of [unclear]corr[/unclear] sub-chloride copper &[deletion]c[/deletion] some compound
of Palladium this heated to redness and the fixed metallic part
put into a residuum jar [insertion](d)[/insertion] intended to collect all the portions
left in experiments
The insoluble portions (b) dissolved in NM Acid the sol
evap to dryness water added &c the insoluble portion again
dissolved until all in permanent solution these solutions
added to solution (e) and now making part of it
Ammonia added to solution (e) with agitation
until in excess a red precipitate fell & a blue solution
formed The precipitate collected washed &c was ammo-
nia muriate of palladium [insertion](f)[/insertion] not quite pure The washings
were deep blue [deletion]([/deletion] and called (g)
A part of the ammonia muriate (f) decomposed
by heat left metal Palladium This dissolved in NM Acid
left an insoluble portion (h) The solution evaporated
to dryness and dissolved in water gave a brown solution
