and an insoluble portion The insoluble part was readily soluble
in MA & was gave sol pure palladium it was apparently a sub-
muriate . The soluble portion still contained copper as was
evident by the action of ammonia This solution was boiled with
a little alcohol to convert oxide into protoxide by which operation *

The washings (g). were evaporated becoming of a green
colour not quite that of copper as the ammonia flew off
when dry they formed a greenish mass which on the
affusion of water & a little MA gave a greenish solu
tion & a yellow insoluble substance the latter to be
called ([underline]i[/underline] [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] ) The solution contained copper when tested
by ammonia & ferro prussiate potash - a plate of copper
put into it gradually became covered with a grey
metallic film - this film examd containd copper for
on action of MA, sub mur copper was dissolved out & nothg
else. - the black powder left was not affected by MA. but
on washing of the MA and adding NA all immediatly dissolved
except a little black powder . the solution contained only nitrate
of Palladium - the black powder was platinum [deletion]hence[/deletion]
