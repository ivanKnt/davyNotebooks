Flaming salt in chlorine gas no action whilst cold - heat up -
little action imperfect charring &. - after-wards examined - water
being poured into retort a solution obtaind which when filterd con-
tained sul acid as was [unclear]evident[/unclear] by Mur bary. the insoluble matter
containd a yellow triple hydro chloride of carbon - and a dark
carbonaceous heavy substance this by MA gave a solution
which tested by Sul Soda, evidently contained Baryta hence
perhaps first SA (in water) not excess of acid but such
as the [deletion]sulphate[/deletion] baryta had been combined with
Sulphur mixed with flaming salt heatd in tube at
first Napthaline rose. then colour of residuum changed to
deep brown some suls acid gas rose & ultimately sul
hydrogen a carbonaceous subst of bar[superscript]ta[/superscript] was left behind
16 gr of the flaming salt analysed Dec[superscript]r[/superscript]. 15 into dry retort
then chloride added - heated - when cold a little N A & alcohol added - [unclear]next[/unclear]
[unclear]morning[/unclear] sol mur baryta added - insol part washd with alcohol till free
[deletion]from [unclear]3 . 5[/unclear]from sul baryta[/deletion] from hydrochlo carbon then washd with water till Mur
baryta [unclear]remd[/unclear]. residue black collectd dried heatd & treatd with SA to change
sulphuret gave sul baryta - the solutions evaporated . the solid matter heatd
washd with water to remove muriate - insol part further heatd to [unclear]destroy[/unclear]
combustible matter - residue treated with SA & heat the sul being with former
portion amounted to 7.2 gr . all the SA [unclear]necessarily[/unclear] here
