was a true amm mur palladium . but differt from the

mur palladium made by digesting the metal in N M &
gave with ammonia the red precipitate insol in Ammona
but on taking a portion of the same solution & [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
boiling it with alcohol it then on the addition of amm
gave very little red precipitate on the application of heat
even that disappeard and a yellow solution was ob-
tained which on evaporation gave the yellow triple
salt. This compound [underline]is [/underline]sol in ammonia not in
weak M A. - The red compound retained in
ammonia seems in part reduced & reduced to the
yellow salt. Hence (i) is proto ammonia [unclear]mur[/unclear]
palladium
Sul Hy added to sol of yellow ammonia gives gradually
a black precipitate
When alcohol is boiled with the mur palladium it
even reduces a part of the metal
There seems to be a sul mur Palladium sol in much water
but not sol in concentratd acid solution
