* some palladium was precipitated . The filtered solution had ammonia
added in excess. which precipitatd scarcely any thing & then by evaporation the
yellow ammonia muriate was expected ultimately however when very
concentratd almost dry. the addition of water & Mur acid did not yield
a yellow but a black or dark brown powder but a little N A added
caused solution of part & then the yellow ammonia muriate became
evident & was separated washed & dried. (k).
The N M acid solution was evaporatd but before it was dry- -
a dark chocolate brown powder [insertion](l)[/insertion] fell & a pale greenish solution remaind (m)
this powder washid gave by last washing brown solution . gas con-
tinually separatd in small quantities from the powder and it had
a smell of chlorine - it was boiled at last with the washing water
and was found entirely soluble the solution crystallizing upon
a glass plate by evaporation . When heated it fused gave out
much Mur acid a little chlorine some mur ammonia & left metallic
palladium The solution is of a deep brown colour this colour is entirely
destroyed by ammonia [insertion]in excess[/insertion], and the sol evaporatd gives the yellow triple

salt Mur acid does not change the solution -
The solution (m) containd much mur copper & mur amm but
no Palladium
Operating with the rest of the solid matter obtained by evaporatng
the washings ([unclear]g[/unclear]) it was heated more than the former portion & on
the affusion of water & the yellow matter obtained was not so
bright but more resembled (k) it may indeed be considered as the
same thing. In both these cases of the preparation of the yellow compond
more heat had been applied in evaporating to dryness hence probably the [unclear]difference[/unclear]
