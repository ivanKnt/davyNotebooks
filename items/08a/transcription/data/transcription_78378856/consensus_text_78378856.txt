seemd more tindery still better than any former if it can be [unclear]cleard[/unclear] from blackness
The other half had S.A added to it till doubled then heated
almost to charring when cold . a thick tarry black mass - added to water
black & more carbon perhaps than before resltd with Carb baryta - on a
[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] heat to [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] . when neutral - first washing gave salt
without flame even. - As dark sol evaporatd [unclear]films[/unclear] separated & the salt
when dry seemed mixed with some extraneous matter [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] probably not resoluble
Flaming salt of baryta dissolvd in baryta water & boild in a flask
for 2 hours then Carb acid introduced tp precipitate free baryta - filtrd
sol not then afftd by more carb acid - evaporatd gave white salt which
burnt on plat foil was as flaming as at first. hence tindery salt not formd
by action of the baryta on the acid or its quantity in the salt
The flaming salt digestd in Alcohol & filtd . the salt left unchanged is as
flaming as ever hence alcohol not decompose it or abstract combustible matter
The sol evaporatd gave a little yellow white salt buing tindery fuzing
a little was a little flame too was very small in quantity and apparently a
little impurity left sul bary but tindery salt seems more sol in alcohol than
flaming salt. the latter comparatively insol in alcohol
