II 319 gr per ox copper 7 gr carb bary & 30 gr per oxide of copper same
materials as used in last experiment. dissold in NM A[unclear]ci[/unclear] & treated exactly
as contents of tube in last expt gave some sul baryta - this when
collectd amounted to 3.5 grains This therefore indicates the [unclear]S[/unclear] acid [unclear]accordingly[/unclear]

10 gr same flaming salt by heat & SA gave 4.16 sul baryta
[deletion]Oil gas product not boilg below 200[superscript]o[/superscript] 1 vol with 1 1/2 vol sul acid - mixed[/deletion]
[deletion]& heated till dark colourd & suls acid came off - on adding water became[/deletion]
[deletion]dark green & there was no separation of oil - The acid saturatd with[/deletion]
[deletion]carb potash gave a brown solution which concentratd to a certain[/deletion]
[unclear]dryness[/unclear] & then set aside crystallised at the edges of the solution in a
[deletion]very peculiar manner - shewing fillaments rising up half an inch[/deletion]
[deletion]high exactly like the vegetation of some [unclear]moses[/unclear] or minute plants[/deletion]
[deletion]evapor[/deletion] the solution had a great tendency to vegetate Evaporatd to
[deletion]dryness a brown salt was obtained which on foil [deletion]bbl[/deletion] blackened &[/deletion]
[deletion]burnt like a coal[/deletion]
[deletion]A portion of the solution precipitated by alcohol & filterd[/deletion]
[deletion]the precipitate pressed & dried then dissolvd in water & crystallid[/deletion]
[deletion]gave crystals which were very pearly [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion][/deletion]
[deletion]The alcohol was clear & colourless havg left all the colour in the[/deletion]
[deletion]salt - evaporated it gave a portion of combustible matter soluble[/deletion]
[deletion]in water & which added to common sul [unclear]potash[/unclear] made it [underline]highly[/underline][/deletion]
[deletion][underline]pearly[/underline] . Hence can now easily form pearly salt[/deletion]
