Palladium
The [underline]pure red [unclear]am[/unclear] mur salt[/underline] - in water & boiled evolves nitrogen and forms
a dark acid solution which when of certain strength prevents further action on residue
of red salt but pouring off the solution adding more water & heating the whole is
decomposed - The solution is of a deep brown colour when weak has it colour
destroyed by Ammonia and on evap gives yellow amm [unclear]mur[/unclear] - when strong has
a triple salt at once precipitated white or nearly so. - The solution with
potash has if strong a precipitate formd at first but by more potash is soluble
forms brown solution paler than first by evaporation to dryness ammonia
is given off and ultimately a black powder is obtaind which being well washed
& dried remaind black.- Heatd upon platinum foil it at one moment un-
dergoes dull ignition changes a little in it colour & then by water gives a little
alkali the rest being metallic palladium - Heated in a tube no oxygen
seems to be given off at the moment of change - The alkali contains
a very little chlorine.
The clear solution found by boiling the red triple salt in water
when evaporated gives off much acid and after being evaporated to dryness
it is found upon the addition of water that a good deal of the red
triple salt is re-formed - by adding water & heating action goes on
again nitrogen is evolvd & a solution formed & this evaporated to
dryness.
