[underline]Mur Soda[/underline] alone & with substance - not much difference in small quan
tities except a general [unclear]looseness[/unclear] of aggregation in substance crystals & less perfect
form
Nit Soda.- is rendered less readily crystallizable - in basin it does
not assume form of definite & clear rhomboids but forms three or four
large masses with crystalline forms but opaque & composed of a number of
minute crystals grouped together so that on the whole the large crystals
[deletion]resemble[/deletion] have an apparent granular structure - Films gradually
separate from these solutions - They are particularly prone to the
formation of separate drops on the surface.
On glass plate . the N Soda with substance gave numerous [unclear]dendroid[/unclear]
arrangements at right angles and at oblique angles . the pure n Soda gave
more but more or less perfect rhomboids.
