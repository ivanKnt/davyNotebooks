[underline]Sul Magnesia[/underline] in basin no appreciable difference - on glass plates those
drops with substance [unclear]most[/unclear] radiated crystals smallest & most confused.
Liquor from pipes of apparatus at Apot hall . rectified given by Hummel. and
drop SA. equal wrights mixed . great heat blacking & thickening - much suls acid
after many days liquid matter (but little) separated was acid black diluted & [unclear]sat[/unclear] by powdered marble an aqueous
sol obtained this evaporated left a mass which by alcohol gave a solution & this evaporated, a substance which added
to sul potash sul copper gave peculiar crystals - but much lime present as a soluble salt - substance dark
coloured but being boiled with animal charcoal became light coloured but still containd much
salt of lime - was bitter - and burnt with difficulty having much sul: lime
The soft solid as other part was black acid and being added to water diffused through it
but little separating - mixture deep green black by heat in basin a pitchy black matter separated [unclear]out[/unclear]

March 28. Sul copper alone blue colour - in basin crytd in separate crystals very
definite & clear on glass plate same -- With substance sol colour green -
in basin vegtatd crystals pearly & indefinite none in solution colour light green - loss of
colour due in part to [unclear]division[/unclear] or want of [unclear]com[/unclear]pactness - a glass plate crytd in
radiated portions - forms imperfect & not at all like the pure salt. colour pale green
a very little of the substance affects this salt.
Oxalic acid crystals not affected
Alum crystals interfered with a little but not much - crystals are smaller
than when substance not present - observd but on glass plate not much difference
in capsule
Rochelle salt - on plate no appreciable interference - in capsules very
little interference except that forms of crystals seened to approximate the
right angled paralle [unclear]pipedious[/unclear]. -
Sulphate of nickel no interference apparently
