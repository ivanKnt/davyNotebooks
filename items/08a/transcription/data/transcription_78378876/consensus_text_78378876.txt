Subsatnce with ether boiled clear solution poured off when cold - ether
evaporated left peculiar matter readily decomposing by heat & charring - burning
with flame and leaving sulphuret potash hence not free from salt
Residuum boiled again with ether solution on coolig deposited crystals
boiled a third time - the two ether solutions evaporated together
gave similar matter to former
The residuum was a soft brown solid matter and boiled with more ether gave
a solution which when cold deposited the fibry crystals - these collected they
burned - blacking fusing & causing flame & left an alkaline residuum they
were not deliquescent & had same taste as substance altogether - acted on residue by more ether by ether and
alcohol & in various ways hot & cold to get separation but all the results seemed of the same kind -
they all contained potash in abundance when burnt and no substance without potash & giving pearly
crystals could be obtained - suspect that the substance is essentially a salt or an acid
since these can be but a very minute quantity of any not a salt present in the matter -
Substance heated with oil gas liquor ( Hamels purified) mixed.
well by agitation - no apparent solution the whole warmed began to
brown - shaken & stirred - residuum became more solid instead of
less so. - the oily fluid deep brown - added to water - heated & well-
shaken then filtered through a wet filter & the aqueous solution eva-
porated but it gave nothing - hence cannot separate the
substance this way
2 gr of the substance (potash salt) & 200 gr sul potash dissolved in
water crystallised by cooling - orduring crystals. 2 gr of lime salt on
substance added & whole redissolved & crystallized - gave pearly crystals
100 grs sulphate added - redissolved &c gave crystals slightly pearly
3 gr lime substance 300 gr sul copper pearly - added 100 more
sul copper - pearly - 100 mre sul copper - pearly but large like those given to
Mr Levy 100 more sulhate pearly - 100 mre still pearly but more approximating to
