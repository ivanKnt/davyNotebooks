Lime from Lieut Drummond has been heated by alcohol & oxygen for
15 minutes - made previously out of a piece of burnt chalk by burning - was
a little more shining on surface than original lime - something like leaf [unclear]sugar[/unclear]
also a little harder - but easily scraped with a knife - fracture also has
the semicrystalline appearance like Sugar - It did not slake & heat in the
mouth but neither did a ball that had been unheated in the lamp - put
into mur acid neither effervesced nor did they dissolve except slowly in
these respects they agreed and seemed both like extremely burnt lime
- they left film of silica & on examination were found to contain it also
a little iron & apparently a very minute trace of magnesia but next
to nothing - they resembled each other in these things
