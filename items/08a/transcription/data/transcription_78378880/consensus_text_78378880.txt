the bottom which was separated & set aside - The dark solution was rubbed with
marble powder till neutral & filtered it was then of a dark colour but being heated
with animal charcoal became of a very light colour - It was then evaporated and
filtered - sul lime was separated lying at the bottom & in small granular crystals
nothing separated encrusting at the surface as usual - The solution had great
power in altering form of sul potash
A little of the solution with alcohol gave a slight precipitate - filtered &
evaporated abundance of a fawn coloured salt was obtained - it burnt with flame blackning
first & left sul lime it became moist [insertion]or rather damp[/insertion] by exposure to air [insertion]but did not deliquesce[/insertion] it was resoluble in
water & a very small quantity gave pearly crystals with sulphate of potash
The whole of the solution above was evaporated until much concentrated
then 3 or 4 times as much alcohol added & the whole filtered in this way
more sul of lime was separated The alcoholic solution was brown - a por-
tion evaporated left a soft mass [insertion](x)[/insertion] which [unclear]continued in[/unclear] the sand bath at
a moderate temperature did not dry up
A portion [insertion](x)[/insertion] digstd in ether & the clear ether solution evaporated gave
a dry substance which burnt with more flame than salt altogether but
contained abundance of lime - dissolved in water & also a portion not
acted on by ether being dissolved both were evaporated. that by ether
had very little colour & was by much the purest both gave dry masses
but that by ether fused more perfectly & burnt with most flame on
platinum foil it also left smallest & hardest residue - the dry
portions exposed to air for 12 hours.
Equal portion of each added to equal portions of sul pot & dessolvd then
crystallisd the crystals were both pearly but it required much more
than usual apparently havng been evaporated two day at first.
