A portion of (x) dissolved in water equal volumes of the solution
put into separate basins one evaporated to [underline]dryness[/underline] then dissolved in
the basin the other not so treated - Equal wrights of sul potash
with water added to the two portions and dissolved so as to yield
crystals on cooling - when cold next day both had yielded pearly
crystals and equal in appearance Hence evaporation to
dryness [underline]does not[/underline] seem to injure the peculiar substance - as [unclear]xx[/unclear]
at first supposed
A portion of (x) put into a retort & distilled with water the
water or product condensed added to sul potash gave

A portion of (x) precipitated by excess of oxalic acid & filtered to [unclear]a pure[/unclear]
oxalate of lime the evaporated liquor became brown and on [deletion][unclear]dryi[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
solid [deletion][insertion](9)[/insertion] heated on foil[/deletion] added to sul potash it still made it pearly
- heated on platinum foil the oxalic acid was dissipated & ultimately
the substance blackened & burnt with flame & by blow pipe left a
white ash which was sulphate of lime [unclear]hence not formd fromxx[/unclear]
Lime by oxalic acid - another portion of the solid [deletion](9)[/deletion] was
heated in ether solution & left to cool. . the ethereal solution was
poured off from the liquid below by evaporation it left a liquid which
when cold was solid & in solution shewed but very
little oxalic acid by now here - a second portion of ether [unclear]xx xxxxx[/unclear]
when separatd gave but substance the tube with
acted portion by water & [unclear]xxxx have xx xx[/unclear] plenty of oxalic
acid Some ether had in part purified it .
