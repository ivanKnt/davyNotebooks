A portion of (x) dissolved & sol carb ammonia added (oil in excess)
filtered & found to retain no lime - evaporated on sand bath & left there
for two or three weeks that excess of carb ammonia might be dissipated
now dissolved & filtered tested by mur lime no precipitate Lime no
carb ammonia left is now [insertion]peculiar[/insertion] salt of ammon [insertion](#)[/insertion] & of a dark brown colour
A very little of the solution crystallizes sul potash strongly pearly -
Evaporated to dryness carefully became a shining brittle brown mass. -
very sapid & bitter - burning with much flame & aromatic odour - leaving charring
ultimately a white film very small - it is very deliquescent
3 grs of dry substance & 300 gr sul copper pearly - 300 more sul copper
pearly - again 300 gr sul copper - pearly - again 300 gr sulphate
solid forms but had pearly lustre in one direction and when dry more
Here only 1 substance to 400 salts
A portion of (#) boiled with baryta in excess ammonia came off -
put into a basin & evaporated to dissipate all the ammonia but by
accident was carried too far were charred slightly - on dissolving in water
agitating with carb acid gas to separate excess of baryta & filting a brown
solution of a barytic salt was obtained - neutral - by evaporating yielding
a dry salt burning with flame & leaving charry residuum - it resembled
a sulph napthalate in appearance but heated in a tube no
naphthaline rose from it. [deletion]it was[/deletion] but an oil fluid bng with flame
it was soluble in water & alcohol &c - added to sul copper sul baryta
precipitated but being filtd & crystallised the sul copper was not
pearly but took up a granulated & earthy form & by stirrg became
