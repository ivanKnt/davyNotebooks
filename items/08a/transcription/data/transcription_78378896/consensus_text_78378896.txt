1827. March
Seeds. [unclear]Pods[/unclear] containing flat round seeds 2 or 3 burning with brigth flame as [unclear]if only[/unclear]
yellow inside & when broken & boild in water - no precipitate of Iron - not 
[insertion]of Iodine .[/insertion]The shell a brittle substance of astringent taste held together slightly by
a sort of lace or coarse net [unclear]water not making xxxxxx[/unclear] the part the [unclear]weight[/unclear] of the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
Colour of substance semitransparent yellow. - Digestd in hot water left
very little undissolved which was [unclear]filament[/unclear] & flocculent & gave yellow solutn
precipitatg Iron black & [unclear]gellng[/unclear] dense white - paper dipped in it is reddend
by acid - browd by alkali: - acid increases turbidness of the solution - flocculi found
then easily filtered - clear-yellow solutin acts on sol of Iron and impure [unclear]jelly[/unclear] as before [unclear]a[/unclear]
diminution of power - Mur acid was used & a drop or two found enough -
A little alkali added to first solution dissolvd sedimet & gave deep yellow brown solut[unclear]ion[/unclear]
Sol [unclear]Alume[/unclear] added caused slight addition of turbidness - added [unclear]amm[/unclear] great precipitattn
filterd - yellow precipitate separated & a clear colourless solution readily obtaid . this
did not discolur sol iron or precip chrystals when amm [insertion]neutralize by excess of MA[/insertion] but [insertion][unclear]another[/unclear] part[/insertion] being evaporatd &
again tested by the lime after ammonia was gone still no precipitating no [unclear]appar[/unclear]
of [unclear]lauric[/unclear] or gallic acid Ammonia alone acted just like potash
Calico mordantd with iron & alumina 2 piece one [unclear]warmd[/unclear] in sol of
[unclear]xxxx[/unclear] with little ammonia ( [unclear]2 or 3[/unclear] drops only) & the others in pure aqueous
[unclear]infusion[/unclear] the former the best as to yellow colour on alumin[unclear]a[/unclear] mordant [unclear]alka[/unclear]
which was good - both pieces dipped half way in infusion of brown
