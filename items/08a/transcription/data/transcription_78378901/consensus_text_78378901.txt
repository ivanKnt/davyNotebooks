1827, Copper ores from W. Phillips
A dark grey massive substance - uncrystallized - heavy - earthy fracture
dull but with little cupreous lustre like that of indigo The surfaces
polish by friction against each other or against hard bodies substance
scratches by a knife - uniform throughout - rubs into a uniform black
powder
Heatd on platina foil - did not change form but gave off abundant
white fumes - like arsenic in smell and left after dull red heat a red
fragment when cold harder than before - this heated to redness no change
but with alcohol of flame gave spongy copper metall[unclear]ic[/unclear]
Heated on charcoal by blow pipe - many white arsenical fumes - [unclear]then[/unclear]
readily fusible metallic globule - in [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] whilst hot - half friable half
brittle but ultimately by heat yieldg a more difficultly fusible button of copper
Heated in a tube - water & ore - then white fumes condensing readily
into a highly crystalline crust - no blackeng or appearance of bitumen
[insertion]except faint odour[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]red[/unclear][/deletion] fragment reddish externally but when broken of a granular
metallic bronze like appearance insidewhich before the blow pipe
fuzed readily. the whole sublimate was arsenious acid by numerous
tests & nothing else -
The pulverised substance boiled in water. an aqueous solution ob-
tained - colourless - & by Nit Silver & [unclear]amm[/unclear] containing arsenious acid
The pulverised substance boiled in potash gave a brown solution
which added to sul copper did [underline]not[/underline] precipitate green - [deletion]neutralized by NA[/deletion]
evaporated to dryness - brown mass[deletion][unclear]es[/unclear][/deletion] heated still brown - not bitumen &c. dissolved
in water brown solution - add in NA colour a little diminished &[unclear]c. brown[/unclear]
