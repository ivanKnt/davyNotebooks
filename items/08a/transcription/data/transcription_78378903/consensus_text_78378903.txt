heated - Then dissolvd & examind it gave plenty [underline]arsenate silver[/underline] [unclear]there[/unclear]
had been too great an excess of alkali before . when the nitrate was
heated a green insoluble matter remained unchanged & solid it
was in small quantity & proved to be arsenite of copper The
residue when well washed dried & heated still gave much arsenious acid
June 28th
The original substance mixd with charcoal & heated in a tube [unclear]arsenous[/unclear]
acid rose - not heat enough to decompose - being mixed with carb potash
& charcoal no sublimate either of white or metallic arsenic - probably to
much carb potash
Substance put into cold strong NA immediate action effervescence [unclear]evolt[/unclear]
of red fumes & production of heat - a green solution obtaind & a little brown
sediment small in quantity - The solution by little potash green precipitate

arsenious acid - by ammonia in excess no precipitate of Iron all in solution
deep blue
Substance in pure [deletion]strong[/deletion] Mur acid cold pulverized action a clear
brown fluid & a black powder . The fluid by potash precipitated arsenite
of copper. by evaporation it left a yellow brown mass ( [unclear]xxx[/unclear] copper) resold

washed in [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] M Acid then in water & dried was a black powder which
heated in a tube was principally sublimed as metallic arsenic a little of
the original substance remaining. the former portion of the powder which
had been washed separately when sublimed was principally sulphuret of
