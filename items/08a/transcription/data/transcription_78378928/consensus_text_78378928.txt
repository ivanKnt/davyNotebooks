1827. Sept 21.
Hydrogen made over clean mercury & clean trough in cylindrical jars, dried
for 3 hours by chloride calcium fuzed  transferred into very flat vessels
four of them having hydrogen then put in & the whole transferrd into a
clean wedgewoods basin with mercuy round them about 1/2 inch deep. the
mercury inside much higher perhaps 1 1/4 inch - height of all carefully marked
by slips of paper at [underline]apparent[/underline] place of contact of mercury with glass. All
four coverd over with a stopperd jar standing also in the mercry & then mo-
derately good oxygen thrown into this jar by a bladder & tube so as to
form atmosphere of oxygen outside the 4 small jars a piece of chlo-
ride of lime in oxygen to keep it dry - All put bye in a dark place -
A similar small jar with hydrogen left over the mercurial
trough (See Sept 27[superscript]th[/superscript])
[underline]1827. Sept 25[superscript]th[/superscript][/underline]. The exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Sept 13 1826 examined
I No change except that M of B is [unclear]wet[/unclear]
II The chloride of Sodium [unclear]covred an[/unclear] inch deep with solution - the nit of silver unchangd
III No apparent change
IV No apparent change
V [deletion]The ars[/deletion] No apparent change
VI The arsenic slightly yellow probably is [unclear]olefiant[/unclear]. The potash solution slightly fawn coloured
VII as at first
VIII No apparent change
IX No change except that from prussiate is wet as at XVII
X No apparent change
XI No apparent change
XII Chloride of lead not changd in appearance The chromate turbid as in XIII.
XIII Nit lead not changed in appearance - Chromate of potash is slightly turbid perhaps had acted on the glass
XIV No apparent change
XV Carb of Soda wet part in solution - Mur lime a little mouldy no precipitate - apparently no change
XVI unchanged in appearance except that NA[unclear]m[/unclear] has abstracted water is partly moist & has cryst[superscript]d[/superscript] in glass
in consequence - hence water has passed over
XVII No change - except that ferro prussiate of potash is [unclear]wet[/unclear] at bottom of tube [unclear]a portion[/unclear] of saturated
solution being then about half inch high.
XVIII . - Iodide potash contains a black precipitate - the acetate of lead is dry & has crystallized there is a [unclear]blackish[/unclear]
film in small quantity on iodide in tube The iodide potash is of a full orange colour
