1827. Sept[superscript]r[/superscript] 27th
Gas expts of Sept 21 - examined - a little gas transferred from one
of the vessels by a Pepys transferrer and the Electrical spark passed through
it in a Eudiometer no appearance of explosion - The vessel & remaining
gas returned to the basin & again coverd with an atmosphere of oxygen -
There had been no sinking of the mercury below the marks.
[underline]1827. Sept 29th[/underline].
Bone oil distilled 1st product & 2[superscript]nd[/superscript] product examined
somewhat [unclear]x[/unclear] both ammoniacal agitated & washed several times with water
but still faintly ammoniacal - then washed with very dilute MA
This took away ammoniacal appearance but left much of the peculiar
smell of burnt animal substance & renderd the colour of both specimens
much darker than before
First product fluid combustible with bright flame &c as was to be
expected being like naphtha - being heated in a tube so as to decompose part of
vapour blackend & a little ammonia evolved - upon adding hydrated potash
& then heating much more ammonia produced - Some of fluid put to sol
carb pot - no particular appearances - [unclear]Some[/unclear] to sol MA about equal vols
much heat - fumes in atmosphere of bottle as if ammonia or some [unclear]such thing[/unclear]
present - heat continued to be evolvd some time but no gas or escape of any
thing .- shaken well - a separation acid very dark & increasd in quantity [deletion]but[/deletion] *
[underline]Second Product[/underline] - like [unclear]former[/unclear] though darker & more fixed - heated above
some ammonia produced - with potash much more - By sol carb potash
as 1st product - by MA. not so much heat but I think more of
the oil dissolved in the acid - colour darker than the former - The
general results like those of 1st product - only difference being apparently that
substance [underline][deletion]h[/deletion]not so readily[/underline] affectd
