1827 Have been examining a miscellaneous mixture of [insertion]moist[/insertion] residua containg
palladium from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Dec[superscript]r[/superscript]. 1825 for the purpose of separatg the :Palla[unclear]dium[/unclear]
excess of acid has been present [unclear]dng[/unclear] the whole time The clear portion was poured
off - the solid portion dissolved in NM A & the whole mixed heated & then
precipitatd by ammonia still having the solution acid In this way by washing &c
the [unclear]amm mur[/unclear] Palladium was separated - ultimately the mother liquor containg very
little palladium were evaporatd to dryness & heated in a crucible. a fuzed salt mixed
with some palladium was obtaid - This dissolvd in water gave a solutin & solid
palladium &c th latter was evperatd & the solution examind by an alkali
this threw down a small port[unclear]on[/unclear] of matters but left a [deletion]yellow[/deletion] [insertion]solution[/insertion] solution [unclear]whch[/unclear]

became yellow [unclear]though in[/unclear] peculiar substance [unclear]touchd[/unclear] by [unclear]ferro hy[/unclear] Pruss pot [unclear]&[/unclear] - A plate of
zinc [unclear]bng immersd[/unclear] in slightly acid liquor threw down a black powder & took
away yellow colour now not recoverable in solution only by either acid
or alkali Hence this black powder (metallic) the cause of the colour
[underline]Black Powder[/underline] heated in close vessels a very little water runs off
heated in the air on foil it appeared to ignite as if in imperfect combustion
& to contract. It was then brittle gave a dark brown powder It proves to be pal-
ladium & the peculiar properties of the solution were due to a small quantity of the
treple salt of palladium(yellow) dissolved with much of other salts from the tests.
