14. July. endeavoured to form a [underline]Magnesiate of Baryta[/underline]. by igniting Carb of
Baryta & per [unclear]ox[/unclear] of Manganese together, but without affect.-
by igniting [underline]NA of Baryta[/underline] & [underline]per ox Manganese[/underline] [deletion]which succeeding[/deletion] [insertion]obtained[/insertion]
a fused mass of a bright green colour. the Mang of Baryta.
[underline]Hydrate[/underline] of Baryta combines easily with per ox of Mang to produce
the same result.- (or [unclear]xxx[/unclear] of Baryta to be used)
Therefore Nit of Baryta (150 [superscript]grs[/superscript]) & Per ox Mang. (45[superscript]grs[/superscript]) were
heated in a crucible they entered into fusion below redness. The [unclear]mass[/unclear]
when cold. had [deletion]g[/deletion]a bright verdigris green colour. colour of rather
a chalky effect when powdered [insertion]combination had taken place completely [insertion]throughout[/insertion].[/insertion].- insoluble in water, in Alcohol & in
Ether - unchanged by a red heat - caustic potassa caused no change
cold or hot.- fused with Nitre or potash. & afterwards dis[superscript]d[/superscript] & exhibits first green
& afterwards red colours. like the chamelion.
15 July. [underline]Sul Acid[/underline]. decomps the salt evolving the [underline]Mang[superscript]ic[/superscript] acid[/underline] - soon [deletion][unclear]rendered[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]followed[/deletion] by the deposition of oxide in large quantity
[underline]Nit Acid[/underline]. decomposes the salt. the Manganesic Acid .remaing in
sol with the Nit of Baryta. exhibited it peculiar tint with
extraordinary intensity- & slowly deposited oxide in 24 hours.
[underline]Oxalic Acid[/underline]. liberates the Magnesic Acid & may be [unclear]separated[/unclear]
from the insol. Oxalate Baryta. the colour however of the
solution has not the peculiar tint. of this acid being more
scarlet.- [deletion]also[/deletion] there is a great tendency to the for[superscript]n[/superscript] of [deletion]the[/deletion]
white Salt.
