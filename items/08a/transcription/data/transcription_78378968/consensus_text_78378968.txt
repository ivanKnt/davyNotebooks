[underline]Indigo[/underline] was acted upon by 8 times of. x weight of [underline]Nitric[/underline] Acid
diluted with water & heat applied - Nitrous gas was give off. &
\ much [underline]resin[/underline] formed, which was separated.- this fluid was then boiled
& set aside but no crystals were formed upon cooling, the liquor was
of a deep yellowish red colour, it was then evaporated & water added
which caused a precipitate at first but it immediately re dissolved
- various means were tried with portions & ultimately by adding
Indigo in powder as long as any action [deletion]was[/deletion] took place in the
liquor & boiling [insertion]upon being allowed to cool[/insertion] - crystals were formed in great abundance
[deletion]in lar[/deletion] of a bright yellow colour_ [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] acicular & in concentric groups
retaining a large quantity of fluid - the crystals when dried [deletion]had[/deletion] shrank

heated upon platina foil, readily faded, burning with a bright flame
with much smoke, leaving a small quantity of white ash, which dis-
. appeared when the foil was heated by the Blowpipe. (?)
In glass tube they readily fused - decomposed leaving a carbonaceous
mass, giving off [insertion][underline]very[/underline][/insertion] peculiar odour. [deletion]white[/deletion] a yellowish oily matter collected
in small drops in the tube shooting into crystals on cooling. the
vapours did not affect Turmeric - but Litmus paper was in
some places reddened & in others [deletion][unclear]turne[/unclear][/deletion] changed to a fine grass.
On Potassa Soda - on Ammonia being applied to the reddened
places, they produced a fine yellow green colour - & in [unclear]no xxxx[/unclear]
