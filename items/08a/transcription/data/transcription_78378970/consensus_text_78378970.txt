yellow tint, which stained the skin & linen fibre yellow. this solution
first reddened & then changed litmus green. Potassa soda & Ammonia
instantly rendrd an intense yellow colour when added. Soda [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]x xx[/unclear][/deletion] gained the deepest colour -. [underline]no crystals[/underline] were deposited when the
solution [insertion]of first crystals was neutralized by Potassa and on[/insertion] being evap[superscript]d[/superscript] was allowed to cool - this shews the absence
of Carbazotic Acid -
These crystals were very soluble in hot water - their solution
gave a Blood red colour to per Sulp[superscript]t[/superscript] of Iron - prep[superscript]d[/superscript] proto &
per Nitrat of Mercury. p[superscript]t[/superscript] white changing to pale yellow - did not
 affect Nit of Silver. & evolved carbonic Acid from the carbonates
of Baryta & Potassa [deletion]for[/deletion] neutralizing & forming with them deep
yellow coloured solutions.
Another portion of the crystals, were left on sand bath. at the bottom of a tube

Boiled with prep[superscript]d[/superscript] oxide of Lead or Litharge it either forms
an orange coloured sandy deposit insoluble in cold water, or a
yellow solution. according to the proportion of Oxide of Lead
