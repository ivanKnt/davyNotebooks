         <h2>Benzoic acid</h2>
         
         
         <p>Symbol/formula: C6H5COOH</p>
         
         <p>The simplest benzene-based carboxylic acid, which has been known since the 16th century.
            One of its discoverers was the legendary clairvoyant Nostradamus. Its most common
            natural source is gum benzoin, a resin found in the bark of trees of the genus Styrax.</p>

         <h2>Potash</h2>
         
         
         <p>An alkaline substance consisting largely of impure potassium carbonate. In October
            1807, Davy decomposed potash using electricity, revealing the previously unknown element
            potassium.</p>

         <p>A flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Generally, it is a fraction of crude oil,
            but it can also be produced from natural gas condensates, petroleum distillates, and
            the fractional distillation of coal tar and peat.</p>

         <p>Symbol/formula: H</p>
         
         <p>Now known as hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest element and, at standard conditions,
            is a gas of diatomic molecules. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-toxic,
            and highly combustible.</p>
