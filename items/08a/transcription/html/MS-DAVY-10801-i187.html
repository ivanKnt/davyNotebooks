         <p>Symbol/formula: H</p>
         
         <p>Now known as hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest element and, at standard conditions,
            is a gas of diatomic molecules. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-toxic,
            and highly combustible.</p>

         <p>Also known as quicksilver. A heavy, silvery element, mercury is the only metallic

         <p>An alkaline substance consisting largely of impure potassium carbonate. In October
            1807, Davy decomposed potash using electricity, revealing the previously unknown element
            potassium.</p>

         <p>Now known as barium chloride. It is a white powder, highly toxic, and imparts a yellow-green
            coloration to a flame.</p>
