         <p>Later known as 'laughing gas'. Davy discovered that nitrous oxide was respirable when
            not contaminated with nitric oxide (NO). Davy researched into the physiological effects

         <p>Potassium oxide. In his 'Elements of Chemical Philosophy', Pt 1, Vol 1 (1812), Davy
            describes how potassa is produced from heating potassium at a low temperature, producing
            a substance containing a large amount of oxygen. When this substance is "heated very
            strongly", it produces "pure potash or potassa" (pp. 323-324).</p>
