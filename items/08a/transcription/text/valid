of carbonic acid - heated highly the carbonic acid was driven off
the powder aggregated - contracting in dimension - and formed

difficulty than before but without the liberation of oxygen or any
gas the state of oxide appears unchanged - powdered in agate it formed
a yellowish powder.

separate floating on it. When the saturated sulphuric acid was
distilled it gave off gas which condensed into the fluid
A tube containing the fluid opened it did not explode or the

producing cold . It was not so rapid in its evaporation as the fluid

Musket balls from Shrapnell shells
Have lain in the bottom of Ships and probably had sea
water amongst them. Some slightly acted on others more
deeply and some changed entirely through the ball
The substance is hard and brittle it splits on the ball and
presents an appearance like some hard varieties of earthy
haematite colour [deletion]dark[/deletion] brown becoming when heated red
and fusing on platinum foil into a yellow flaky substance
like litharge - powdered & boiled in water no M A. or lead in

residuum and the solution gave very faint indicis only of
Mur acid. It is a prot oxide of lead - probably formed
by galvanic action of the iron shell the leaden balls and the
sea water. Query the state of the shells for the iron would
be the positive element.

Was black and dirty - digested in hot Alcohol and the clear solution
set aside [unclear]flocxxxx[/unclear] separated from it on cooling which when dried
collected and fused gave a grayish substance of a waxy lustre &
appearance but rather more brittle. heat softens and melts it &
it burns like fat [insertion]it does not melt in boiling water[/insertion] it is a little lighter than water but not much
so. it dissolves readily in alkalies more readily than oil or fat
forming a turbid solution
and in this respect resembles Chevreuls acids of fat as well also
as in its solubility in alcohol when burnt it leaves an ash
consisting principally of carbonate of lime . It is not soluble
in ether or very slightly so - it contains scarcely an appreciable
trace of copper .
The alcohol which has deposited the above substance
on evaporation affords a portion of a substance similar in
many respects but much softer even fluid. It burns in the
same way. - leaves a slight ash of Carb lime &.&.
When the action of the alcohol is continued sufficiently long
nothing remains but dirt & mechanical impurities

vessel containing hydrogen ignited as it fell by the pail where
the hydrogen was in contact with the air. It would probably
fire a mixture of oxygen & hydrogen or air & hydrogen
It is evident from the platina in the retort that it has the
power whilst so finely divided of condensing the hydrogen about it pro-
bably to a very great extent (something like charcoal) and also that
in this state the hydrogen is capable of combining with oxygen with
out any previous elevation of temperature as shewn by the heating
of the hydrogen & platina in the air. and the ignition of the platinum
before a stream of hydrogen [deletion]is th[/deletion] in the air is therefore easily
explained as the temperature first elevated by condensation would go
on increasing by the continued combination of the hydrogen with the
oxygen.
I tried hydrogen on gold thrown down by Sulphate of Iron
but could get no effect of heat
Supposing that this peculiar state induced by the plati
num on the hydrogen and which evidently rendered it capable
of combining with oxygen when it otherwise would not have done
might enable it also to combine with other bodies I passed a
mixture of hydrogen with a little chlorine over the platinum
in the tube - I did not perceive any combination probably
the chlorine had acted on the platinum
But mixing 1 Vol Nitrogen & 3 Vols hydrogen together and
passing them over platinum in a tube although there was no
action at common temperatures nor at or above a visible heat
yet when the tube was heated below a visible heat perhaps to 400°

Some of the salts dry heated in a close tube - it becomes black evolved empy-
reumatic odour also water and fumes and the residue in water was alkaline
though apparently no sulphuret of potash had been formed for no smell of sul hydro

The salt is [deletion]much[/deletion] more soluble in water than sulphate of potash when
solutions of the two are evaporated they decidedly differed in appearance &
manner of crystallizing the new salts taking up a silky appearance like
acetate of potash or mercury when dry. Especially if the salt be dried it was
also of a taste more bitter than the pure sul potash

Soda hence are baryta [unclear]salts[/unclear] free from combination The combination of barytes or its

it did not crystallise as readily in acicular crystals [deletion]but[/deletion] the tufts were very small

Palladium
The [underline]pure red [unclear]am[/unclear] mur salt[/underline] - in water & boiled evolves nitrogen and forms
a dark acid solution which when of certain strength prevents further action on residue
of red salt but pouring off the solution adding more water & heating the whole is
decomposed - The solution is of a deep brown colour when weak has it colour
destroyed by Ammonia and on evap gives yellow amm [unclear]mur[/unclear] - when strong has
a triple salt at once precipitated white or nearly so. - The solution with
potash has if strong a precipitate formd at first but by more potash is soluble
forms brown solution paler than first by evaporation to dryness ammonia
is given off and ultimately a black powder is obtaind which being well washed
& dried remaind black.- Heatd upon platinum foil it at one moment un-
dergoes dull ignition changes a little in it colour & then by water gives a little
alkali the rest being metallic palladium - Heated in a tube no oxygen
seems to be given off at the moment of change - The alkali contains
a very little chlorine.
The clear solution found by boiling the red triple salt in water
when evaporated gives off much acid and after being evaporated to dryness
it is found upon the addition of water that a good deal of the red
triple salt is re-formed - by adding water & heating action goes on
again nitrogen is evolvd & a solution formed & this evaporated to
dryness.

NA takes a green colour from it. Alkali gives a sol brown green and
renders the wood brown also - Alcohol takes out part of the green
colour. Ether but little
The wood burnt gives a pale white ash - no copper or mineral

The brown alkaline solution by the action of acid as SA becomes
bright green & evidently contains the colour The green seems to precipitate by
