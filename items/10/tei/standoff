It was first described by Newman in 1816 and consisted of a rectangular box with a pump attached vertically at one end and a blowpipe at the other. The box acted as a resevoir for compressed gas and when filled with and oxy-hydrogen mixture the flame it produced burned hot enough to melt platinum. Davy's advice was sought on the optimum size of the blowpip's orifice. </p>
