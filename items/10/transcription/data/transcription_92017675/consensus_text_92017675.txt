[underline]Davy's Papers [/underline]
This volume and a similar one
[unclear]Post[/unclear] size contain certain original papers of
Sir H. Davy. I had to copy these, the first rough
papers, which were then usually destroyed:
until I begged to have them as a remem-
brance of the Man & the places when they were
written. My request was granted and these
with the exception of one or two in my copy of
the Life of Davy are what  I thus saved
from destruction
