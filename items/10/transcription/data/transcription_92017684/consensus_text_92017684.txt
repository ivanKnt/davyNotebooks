[underline]Experiments with M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Stevensons second lamp[/underline]
This lamp was made like the other except that
wick was placed in the middle of it as is represented
in his plate and three tubes around it exactly of the
dimensions and figure of those described in the report of
the committee The lamp was lighted and the top [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
the flame gradually diminished and as soon as the air
contained in the lamp was exhausted went out: It was
repeatedly lighted but by no device could it be made to
burn; tubes of this diameter length and curvature not per
mitting a sufficient circulation of air It is evident therefore
that this lamp could have burned only in consequence of a
admission of air from some other source than the tubes
A lamp was tried upon the model of the tube
lamp [deletion]figured in M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Stevensons pamphlet with a cylindrical[/deletion] [insertion]so as to burn feebly by a descending current[/insertion]
[deletion]top perforated with holes. This lamp burned from a descending[/deletion]
[deletion]current of air as was proved by putting the lower part in [/deletion] [insertion]of air. This lamp as[/insertion]
[deletion]water to close the tubes and as[/deletion] might be expected when
placed in an explosive atmosphere instantly fired it
[underline]Experiments with M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Stevensons third lamp[/underline]
The apertures in the top of the lamp are very near
3/10 of an inch in diameter Those in the bottom being punched
in tolerably thick copper are of different diameters at the
surface of the plate and the extremity of the burr when
measured by callipers at their upper diameters some of these
are 1/8 of an inch but if gauged by passing wires of different
thicknesses through them so as to measure their lower [unclear]diam[/unclear]
few of them equal 1/12 of an inch and only one equalled
the greater number are between one twelfth and one [deletion]fifteenth[/deletion][insertion]fourteenth[/insertion]
