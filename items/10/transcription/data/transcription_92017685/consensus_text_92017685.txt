of an inch wide. All the larger holes below were stopped
up in this lamp yet it passed the explosion as readily as
before and such was its facility of communicating inflam-
mation that when slowly brought near a tube from which
gas was issuing into the atmosphere it inflamed the gas
on the outside of the lamp
It is evident from this experiment that no one
of these [underline]original[/underline] lamps of M[superscript]r[/superscript] G Stevenson could have been
[deletion]a safe lamp[/deletion] [insertion]used in explosive atmospheres[/insertion] and that no conclusions concerning safe operations
could have been deduced from them.-
- They may be all of them be made to burn
firedamp or pure carburetted Hydrogene
by being placed over small blowers;[deletion]&[/deletion]
but for this purpose the slider [deletion]& th[/deletion]
of the tube lamps must be partially
closed or it must be very rapidly
passed through the explosive medium
whenever an explosive atmosphere can
enter the [deletion]holes[/deletion] [deletion]apertures[/deletion] air feeders
explosion [insertion]is always communicated[/insertion] to the external atmosphere.
