In a work published in 1812, I have pointed
out some of the analogies between the
substances considered in the present
state of our knowledge as undecompounded
& I have endeavored to found a
classification upon these [deletion][unclear]xxxxx similarity[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion]analogies.
I [deletion]classed[/deletion][insertion]placed[/insertion] oxygene & chlorine together [deletion]as empyrical[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]empyri[/deletion] substances eminently[/deletion] supporting [insertion]because in combining with inflammable[/insertion]
[deletion]combustion[/deletion] bodies & metals, they produce
heat & light in a much higher degree
than any other known species of matter &
because [insertion]many of[/insertion] their compounds are possessed of
analogous chemical & electrical qualities
At the same time I[deletion]have[/deletion] stated that
there is a general claim of resemblances
between all the chemical elements
& that while sulphur is analogous to
chlorine in one of its properties, it
[deletion]is important to[/deletion] possesses more [deletion]of[/deletion] general
resemblances to Phosphorus.
The progress of chemical discovery since
that time has added new links in
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] system of analogies & modified
