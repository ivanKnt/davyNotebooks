Sulphur that which I have mentioned above
& they differ from it in their electrical
relations & in the chemical & electrical
nature of all their other compounds,
& agree in these respects with oxygene.
- Like oxygene in Voltaic arrangements
they are determined to the positive surface
- whereas Sulphur is separated at the
negative surface; the[deletion]y[/deletion] compounds they
form with metals strongly resemble
those formed by oxygene; they are
[deletion]nonconducting[/deletion] electrics & many of them
soluble in water & possessed of acid
properties whereas those formed by
Sulphur are all non electrics & insoluble

I have always vindicated the claims of Scheele
but I must assume for myself the labour of having demonstrated its properties [insertion] & combin[unclear]x[/unclear] & of having explained the chemical phenomena it produces[/insertion]
& I shall quote a passage from the English
[deletion]translation of [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] Essays - M Ampere[/deletion]
& I am in possession of a letter from M
Ampere which shews that He has no claim
of this kind to make
With respect to the nature of fluoric
acid still a hypothetical subject
M Ampere [insertion]was[/insertion] certainly [insertion]original but He[/insertion] formed his opinion
in consequence of my views of Chlorine [deletion]independently of[/deletion]
