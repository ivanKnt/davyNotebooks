[deletion]As[/deletion] I cannot admit M Gay Lussacs
views on the [deletion]analogies[/deletion] [insertion]classification[/insertion] of the undecompounded
substances [deletion]so neither can[/deletion] nor can I
adopt his ideas respecting their properties
as chemical agents.- He considers hydrogene
as an [underline]alkalizing[/underline] principle & Azote as
an [underline]acidifying[/underline] principle; This is an
attempt to introduce into chemistry
a doctrine of occult qualities; & to
refer to some mysterious & [deletion]unaccounted[/deletion]
[deletion]excl[/deletion] inexplicable energy what [insertion]must [/insertion]depend
upon a peculiar corpuscular arrangement
- If Hydrogene is an alkalizing principle
it is [deletion]wonderful[/deletion] [insertion]strange[/insertion] that it should form
some of the strongest acids by uniting
to bodies not in themselves acid, &
if Azote be an acidifying principle
it is equally strange that it
should form [deletion]the constituent of an[/deletion]
[deletion]alkali[/deletion] nearly 9/10 of the weight of
the volatile alkali.- it is impossible
to infer what will be the qualities
