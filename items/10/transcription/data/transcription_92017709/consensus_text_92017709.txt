If oxygene and hydrogene in the proportion in
which they form water are to be
considered as passive, as neutralizing each
other in all combinations in which
they exist, then [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]almost[/insertion] all the vegetable
acids must be considered as acids
of carbon which though containing
much less oxygene than carbonic
acid & some of them less even than
carbonic oxide have yet strong acid
powers -
I have discovered a [insertion]gaseous[/insertion] combination
of four proportions of oxygene & 1 of
chlorine which has no acid properties
M Gay Lussac had discovered a
compound of 2 proportions of hydrogene
1 of chlorine and six of oxygene
which has acid properties, but
He considers this substance [deletion]as[/deletion]
merely as chlorine acidified
by oxygene & neglects the hydrogene
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] without which He allows however
