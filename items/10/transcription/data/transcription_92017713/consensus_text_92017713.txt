Only those acids which are compounds of oxygene

[deletion]Phosphoric acids & the metallic acids[/deletion]; & it
is impossible to define the nature of
the arrangement of the elements in
their neutral compounds - The phosphates
& carbonate of Lime have much less
the character of neutrosaline bodies than

last body is not known to contain
either acid or alkaline matter.-
The chloriodic acid, the phosgenic acid &
[deletion]also [/deletion]the [insertion]binary[/insertion] acids containing hydrogene
combine with ammonia without decomposition
but they appear all to be decomposed
in acting upon the fixed alkalies or
alkaline earths, & yet the [insertion]solid[/insertion] substances

which were [deletion]all [/deletion]formerly regarded as
peculiar to neutral salts consisting of
acids & alkalies; though they none of
