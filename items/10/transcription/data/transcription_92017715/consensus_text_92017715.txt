Hydrochloric acid would signify
chloric acid combined with
water & therefore according to
M Gay Lussac's own views is
more applicable to his
[underline]chloric[/underline] acid than to muriatic
acid.- The term hydro acids
strictly signifies acids combined
with water, & not acids of
which one of the constituents
is Hydrogene.-
