Cyanogene [insertion]freed from Prussic vapour by red oxide of mercury[/insertion] slowly in oxygene
gas & cooled the product by
a freezing mixture but no water
was [deletion]formed[/deletion] [insertion]deposited[/insertion] [deletion]when it had[/deletion]
[deletion]been freed from the prussic[/deletion]
[deletion]vapour by red oxide of mercury.[/deletion]
- I decomposed Cyanogene by
passing electrical sparks through
it when it gave its

charcoal.

of research on a subject
which is peculiarly M Gay

venture to point out to [deletion]that[/deletion] him

combinations of cyanogene
[deletion]which does not seem[/deletion]
