Notice of some experiments & new views
[underline]respecting flames[/underline] By Sir [underline]H. Davy.-[/underline]
When a wire gauze safe lamp is made to
burn in a very explosive mixture of coal gas & air, the light
is feeble & of a pale blue colour; whereas the flame
of a current of coal gas burnt in the atmosphere;
as is well known by the phenomena of the gas
lights, is extremely brilliant. In a paper read
before the Royal Society, I have endeavoured to shew,
that in all cases flame is a continued combustion
of explosive mixtures; it became, therefore, a problem
of some interest; "Why the combustion of explosive
mixtures of the same substances under different
circumstances, should produce such different appearances."
A very acute philosopher, who himself started the subject
in conversation, suggested the idea, that in the
combustion of explosive mixtures within the lamp
carbonic oxide might be formed; & that the light
might be deficient, from the deficiency of the quantity of
oxygene necessary to produce carbonic acid.- On
submitting this idea to the test of experiment, it was
discovered to be unfounded; for by the combustion in
the wire-gauze lamp, carbonic acid was produced in
quantities as great as could have been expected from
the quantity of oxygene consumed; & on adding oxygene
to [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]a mixture in quantities more than sufficient to
burn the whole of the gas, the character of the light
still continued the same.
In reflecting on he circumstances of the two species of
combustion, I was led to imagine that the cause of
the superiority of the light of the [underline]stream[/underline] of coal gas might
be owing to the [underline]decomposition[/underline] of a part of the gas
towards the interior of the flame where the oxygene was
in smallest quantity, & the deposition of solid charcoal
