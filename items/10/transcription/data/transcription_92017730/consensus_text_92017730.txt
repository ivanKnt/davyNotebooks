which, first by [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] ignition[/deletion] its [underline]ignition[/underline] & afterwards
by its [underline]combustion[/underline], increased in a high degree
the intensity of the light; & a few experiments
soon convinced me that this was the true solution
of the problem.-
I held a piece of wire-gauze of about 900
apertures to the square inch over a stream
of coal gas issuing from a small pipe, &
inflamed the gas above the wire gauze;
which was almost in contact with the
orifice of the pipe; when it burned with its
usual bright light; [deletion]-[/deletion] On raising the wire-gauze
so as to cause the gas to be mixed with
more air before it inflamed, the light
became feebler; & at a certain distance
the flame assumed the precise character of
that of an explosive mixture burning within
the lamp; but though the light was so feeble
in this last case, the heat was greater than when
the light was much more vivid, & a piece of
wire of platinum held in this feeble blue flame
became instantly white hot.-
On reversing the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] by inflaming a stream of
Coal gas, & passing a piece of wire gauze
gradually from the summit of the flame to
the orifice of the pipe, the result was still
more instructive; for it was found that the
apex of the flame intercepted by the wire
gauze afforded no solid charcoal, but in
passing it downwards, solid charcoal was given
off in considerable quantities, & prevented from
