burningly the cooling agency of the wire-gauze;
& at the bottom of the flame where the gas burnt blue
in its immediate contact with the atmosphere, charcoal
ceased to be deposited in visible quantities.-
- This principle of the increase of the brilliancy
& density of flame by the production & ignition
of solid matter, appears to admit of many
applications. I have commenced the experimental
investigation of some of them; but as my enquiries
are still unfinished, I shall hint only at
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the most obvious of the views
connected with them. On a future occasion
I hope to be able to pursue at full length this
interesting subject.-

of the inner blue flame, where the heat is greatest,
is the point where the whole of the charcoal is burnt
in its gaseous combinations without previous deposition.-

Phosphorus & of Zinc in oxygene, &c. & of
Potassium in chlorine; & the feebleness of the

matter alone is produced, such as those of
Hydrogene & Sulphur in oxygene, phosphorus in
chlorine &c.
