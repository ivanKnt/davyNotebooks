burning substances, by placing in their flames even
incombustible substances. Thus the intensity of
the light of burning sulphur, Hydrogene, carbonic
oxide &c. is wonderfully increased by throwing into
them oxide of Zinc, or by placing in them
very fine [unclear]xxxxxthers[/unclear] or metallic gauze.-
4: It leads to deductions respecting the
chemical nature of bodies & various phenomena
of their decomposition. Thus Ether burns with
a flame which seems to indicate the presence
of olefiant gas in that substance. Alcohol burns
with a flame similar to that of a mixture of
carbonic oxide & hydrogene; so that the first is
probably a binary compound of olefiant gas & water
& the second of carbonic acid & hydrogene.-
When [deletion]Cuprine[/deletion][insertion]Cuprane[/insertion] or protochlorid of copper is introduced into
the flame of a candle or lamp, it affords a peculiar
dense & brilliant red light, tinged with green & blue
towards the edges, which seems to depend upon the chlorine
being separated from the copper by the hydrogene, &
the ignition or combustion of the solid copper & charcoal.
Similar explanations may be given to the phenomena
presented by the action of other combinations of
chlorine on flame; & it is probable that in many
of those cases when the colour of flame is changed
by the introduction of incombustible compounds that
the effect depends upon the production & subsequent
ignition or combustion of inflammable matter from them.
Thus the rose coloured light given to flame by the
compounds of Strontium and Calcium, & the yellow colour
given by those of Barium, & the green by those
of Borion may depend upon a temporary production
of these bases by the inflammable action of the flame.
