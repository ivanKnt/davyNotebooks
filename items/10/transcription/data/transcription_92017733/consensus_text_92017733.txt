Whenever a flame is remarkably brilliant & dense, it
may be always concluded that some solid matter
is produced in it: on the contrary, when a flame
is extremely feeble & transparent, it may be inferred
that no solid matter is formed. Thus none of the
volatile combinations of sulphur burn with a
flame in the slightest degree opaque; & consequently,
there is no reason from the phaenomena of its flame
to suspect the existence of any fixed basis in Sulphur.
5. These views will probably offer illustrations
of electrical light. The Voltaic arc of flame
from the great battery, differs in colour & intensity
according to the substances employed in the circuit;
& is infinitely more brilliant & dense with
charcoal than with any other substances.- May not
this depend upon particles of the substances separated
by the electrical attractions ? & the particles of
charcoal being the lightest amongst solid bodies
( as their elementary proportional number shews ) &
the least coherent, would be separated in the
largest quantities.-
6. The heat of flames may be actually
diminished by increasing their light (at least
the heat communicable to other matter) & vice
versa.- The flame which produces the most
intense heat amongst those I have examined,
is that of a mixture of oxygene & hydrogene in
slight excess compressed in Newmans blowpipe
apparatus, & inflamed from a small aperture.
This flame is hardly visible in sunshine, yet it
instantly fuses very refractory bodies; & the light
from solid matters ignited in it, is so vivid
as to be painful to the eye,-
