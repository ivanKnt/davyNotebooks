Some Researches on Flame
by Sir H Davy LLD VPRI FRS
I have described in the papers which the
Royal Society have favoured with a place in their
transactions [insertion]a number of [/insertion][deletion]various[/deletion] experiments on combustion which
show that the explosion of gaseous mixtures [insertion]can[/insertion] [deletion]could[/deletion] be pre
vented or arrested by various cooling influences, and
which led me to discover a tissue permeable to light
and air but impermeable to flame on which I
founded the invention of the wire gauze lamp now
generally used in all collieries in which inflammable
air prevails for the preservation of lives & persons
of the miners - In a short notice published in the
third number of the Journal of Science and the Arts
edited by the Royal Institution I have given an account
of some new results on flame which shew that the intensity
of the light of flames depends principally upon the production
and ignition of solid matter in combustion and that the
heat and light in this process are in a great measure
independant phenomena. - Since this notice has been
printed I have made a number of [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] researches on flame
and as they appeared to me to throw some new light on
this important subject and to lead to some practical
views connected with the useful arts I shall without
any further apology present them to the Royal Society.
That greater distinctness may exist in the
details I shall treat of my subjects under four head. In
