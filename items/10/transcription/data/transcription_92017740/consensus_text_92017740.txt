the first I shall discuss the effects of rarefaction by partly
removing the pressure of the atmosphere upon flame and ex
plosion. In the second I shall consider the effects of heat in
combustion In the third I shall examine the effect of the
[underline]mixture[/underline] of gaseous substances not concerned in combustion upon
flame and explosion. In the fourth I shall offer some general
views upon flame and point out certain practical and
theoretical applications of the results.
1[superscript]st[/superscript] [underline]On the effect of rarefaction by partly re[/underline]
[underline]moving the pressure of the atmosphere upon flame[/underline]
[underline]and explosion[/underline]
The earlier experiments upon the Boylean
vacuum observed that flame ceased in highly rarefied air
but the degree of rarefaction necessary for this effect has
been differently stated. Amongst late experiments M de
Grotthuss has examined this subject He has asserted that
a mixture of oxygene and hydrogene ceases to be explosive
by the electrical spark when rarefied 16 times and that a
mixture of chlorine and hydrogene cannot be exploded
when rarefied only 6 times and he generalises by supposing
that rarefaction whether produced by removing pressure or by
heat has the same effect
