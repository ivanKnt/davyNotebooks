The earlier experimenters upon the Boylean
vacuum observed that flame ceased
in highly rarefied air; that the degree
of rarefaction necessary for this effect
has been differently stated - Amongst
late experimenters M de Grotthuss has
examined this subject; He has [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] asserted
that a mixture of oxygene & Hydrogene
ceases to be explosive [insertion]by the electrical spark[/insertion] [deletion]at[/deletion] when rarefied
[deletion]to 1/16[/deletion] 1/16 times & that a mixture
of Chlorine & hydrogene cannot be exploded
when rarefied only 6 times; & He
generalizes by supposing that rarefaction
whether [deletion]by[/deletion] produced by removing pressure
or by heat has the same effect.
