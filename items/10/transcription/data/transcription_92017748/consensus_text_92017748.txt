[insertion]A[/insertion] It appears from this result
that y[superscript]e[/superscript] flame of Hydrogene is
extinguished in rarefied
atmospheres only when the
heat it produces is insufficient
to keep up the combustion
which appears to be when
it is incapable of [deletion]heating[/deletion]
communicating visible ignition
to metal & as this is
the temperature required
for the inflammation of
hydrogene at common pressure
it appears that its
[underline]combustibility[/underline] is neither
diminished nor increased
by rarefaction from the
removal of pressure
