and produces a considerable degree of heat in combustion it was
therefore probable that it would [deletion]burn[/deletion] bear a greater degree of
rarefaction without having its power of exploding destroyed and this
I have found [insertion]in many trials[/insertion] is actually the case contrary to the assertion of M
Grotthuss - Oxygene and hydrogene in the proportions to form
water will not explode by the electrical spark when rarefied
[deletion]20[/deletion] 18 times but hydrogene and chlorine in the proportions to form
Muriatic acid gas gave a distinct flash of light under the same
circumstances and they combined [deletion]when the[/deletion] with visible inflam-
nation when [insertion]the spark was passed through them [deletion]xxxx [/deletion][/insertion][deletion]as to[/deletion] [insertion]being[/insertion] 1/24.
The experiment on the flame of hydrogene with
the wire of platinum [insertion]& which holds good with [deletion]all the other[/deletion] flames of the other gases[/insertion] shews that by preserving heat in rarefied
air or giving heat to a mixture inflammation may be continued
when under common circumstances it would be extinguished . This
I found was the case in [deletion]many[/deletion] other instances [insertion]when the heat was differently communicated[/insertion] thus when cam-
phor was burned in a glass tube so as to make the upper
part of the tube red hot the inflammation contained when
the vacuum was 1/9 whereas it would only continue to 1/6 when
it was burned in a thick metallic tube which could not
be considerably heated by it.
By bringing a little Naphtha in contact with a red hot
iron it inflamed when there remained in the receiver only
1/30 of the original quantity of air; [insertion]though without foreign heat its flame is extinguished when the quantity is 1/6.-[/insertion]
I rarefied a mixture of oxygene and hydrogene by
the air pump [insertion]to about 18 times - when they could [/insertion] [deletion]till they could no longer[/deletion] be inflamed by the
electrical spark I then heated strongly the upper part of the
tube till the glass began to soften and then passed the spark
when a feeble flash was observed not reaching far into the
tube the heated gases only appearing to enter into inflam-
nation. [insertion]This last experiment requires [deletion]some [/deletion]considerable care. if the exhaustion is [deletion]more considerable [/deletion] much greater, it does not[/insertion]
