succeed; & if the heat is [unclear]pxxxxxed[/unclear] so far
as to make the glass luminous, the flash of
light which is extremely feeble is not visible.
It is difficult to procure the [deletion]prope[/deletion] proper degree
of exhaustion & to give the exact degree of heat, I
have however succeeded three times in [insertion]obtaining[/insertion] the results
& in one instance it was witnessed by [deletion]two persons[/deletion]

- To elucidate the enquiry still further,
I made a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the heat
produced by the different gasses in combustion
[deletion]as compared with[/deletion] - In comparing the heat [deletion]given[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] communicated to the wires of platinum by
flames of the same size, it was evident
that Hydrogene & olefiant gas [insertion]in oxygene & Hydrogene on [unclear]wh [/unclear][/insertion] produced
a much greater [underline]intensity[/underline] of [insertion]heat in [/insertion]combustion than
the other gaseous substances burnt in oxygene; but
no regular [unclear]scale[/unclear] could be formed from [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion]
observations of this kind - I endeavored to
gain some approximations on the subject
by burning equal quantities of [deletion]the [/deletion]different
gasses under the same circumstances & applying
the heat to an apparatus in which it
could be measured - For the purpose
a [unclear]mercural[/unclear] gas holder was furnished with
s system of stopcocks & [deletion]a small strong[/deletion] terminating
by a strong tube of platinum [deletion]perforated[/deletion] I

fixed a small cup filled with olive oil
in which a thermometer was placed.- The oil
