[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] the increments of temperature & the quantity of oxygene [unclear]consumed[/unclear]
It will be useful to reason upon
[deletion]these[/deletion][insertion]this[/insertion] [deletion]results[/deletion][insertion]ratio[/insertion]  as [underline]exact[/underline]; for charcoal
was deposited both from the olefiant
gas & coal gas during the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] &
much Sulphur was [deletion]thrown down upon[/deletion]
deposited from the sulphuretted hydrogene & it
[insertion]impossible to doubt that the capacity of fluids for heat increases their temperature it [/insertion] [deletion]xxx[/deletion] confirms however the general
conclusions & proves that Hydrogene
[deletion]produces the greatest degree of heat[/deletion]
stands at the head of the scale &
gaseous oxide of carbon at the bottom.
- It might at first view be imagined
that according to this scale the flame
of carbonic oxide ought to be extinguished
[insertion]by rarefaction[/insertion] before that of carburetted hydrogene; but
it must be remembered as I have
shewn in a former communication that
carbonic oxide is a much more combustible
gas; Carbonic oxide inflames in the
atmosphere when brought in contact with
an [deletion]wir[/deletion] iron wire heated to dull
redness; whereas carburetted hydrogene
is not inflammable by a similar wire
unless it is heated to whiteness so as
to burn with sparks.-
