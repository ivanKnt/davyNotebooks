- The results detailed in the preceding

[deletion]of gaseous[/deletion] combustibility of gaseous
mixtures - Before I made any direct
experiments on this subject, I endeavored
to ascertain the degree of expansion
which could be communicated to elastic
fluids by the strongest heat that
can be applied to glass vessels - For
this purpose I introduced into a [deletion]measured[/deletion]
graduated curved glass tube, some fusible
metal - I heated the fusible metal
