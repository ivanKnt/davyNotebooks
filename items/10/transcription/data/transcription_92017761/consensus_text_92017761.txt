it would appear that the temperature of

M Grothuss describes an exp[superscript]t [/superscript]in which [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear]
[deletion]oxygene[/deletion] air & hydrogene expanded to 4 times their
bulk [insertion]over mercury[/insertion] by heat would not inflame by the
electric Spark; It is evident that [deletion]their[/deletion]
[deletion]explos[/deletion] in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] a large quantity of
Steam [insertion] or of mercurial vapour[/insertion] must have been present which
like other [insertion]inexplosive[/insertion] elastic fluids prevents [deletion]explosive[/deletion][insertion]combustion[/insertion]
when mixed in certain quantities with
explosive mixtures; but though He seems
aware that his [deletion]apparatus[/deletion][insertion]gasses[/insertion] w[deletion]as[/deletion]ere not
dry; yet He draws his general conclusion
that expansion by heat destroys the
explosive powers of gasses [deletion]principally[/deletion] from this [deletion]incorrect[/deletion][insertion]inconclusive[/insertion]
exp[superscript]t[/superscript].
I introduced into a small graduated
tube over well boiled mercury a mixture
of 2 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Hydrogene & 1 of oxygene & heated
[deletion]them to[/deletion] the tube by a large spirit lamp
till the volume of the gas was increased
from 1 to 2.5 nearly, I then by means
of a blowpipe & a another spirit lamp
made the upper part of the tube red
hot when an explosion instantly took
place.-
