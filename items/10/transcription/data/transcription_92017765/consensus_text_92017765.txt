.- The effect of the slow combination of
oxygene and hydrogene is not connected
with [deletion][unclear]any[/unclear][/deletion] their rarefaction by heat:
for I found that it took place
when the gasses were confined in a
tube by fusible metal rendered solid
at its upper surface; & [deletion]apparently [unclear]no[/unclear][/deletion]

- M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Grothuss has stated that if
a [deletion]hot[/deletion][insertion]glowing[/insertion] coal be brought in contact
with a mixture of oxygene & hydrogene
it only rarefies them but does not
explode them; but this depends upon
the degree of heat communicated by
[underline]the coal[/underline], if it is red in daylight
and free from ashes it uniformly explodes
the [deletion]gass[/deletion] mixture; if its redness is barely
visible in shade it will not explode
them, but [deletion]that is[/deletion][insertion]the phaenomenon[/insertion] is wholly unconnected
with rarefaction [insertion]as[/insertion] is shewn by this
circumstance "if when the heat is
greatest & before the invisible combination
