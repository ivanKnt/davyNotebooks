half a grain, & of this [deletion]less than[/deletion] [insertion]not more than[/insertion]
two thirds could have been water
- Now if chlorine had been
decomposed in this operation, the
quantity of water ought to have
[deletion]amounted to between three &[insertion]near[/insertion] four[/deletion] [deletion]been at least[/deletion]

times as great -
I have shown by [unclear]numerous[/unclear] experiments
that in the action of muriatic acid
gas upon metals hydrogen equal
in volume to half the volume
of the gas is produced, it is
therefore evident that if water
had been produced in the action
of muriatic acid gas on metals
it must have been the chlorine
or the metal or both that
were decomposed - As chlorine
can be freed from aqueous
vapour by [insertion]dry[/insertion] muriate of lime
[deletion]it appears[/deletion] which is not the case
