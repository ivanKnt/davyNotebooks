of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]the[/insertion] general series of proportions [insertion]that I assigned to its[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] the[/deletion]
Compounds [deletion]of Phosphorus[/deletion].- In a case where my [insertion]conclusions[/insertion][deletion]results[/deletion]
differ so materially from those of [deletion]two Chemists so distinguished[/deletion]
[deletion]as[/deletion] M M Berzelius & Dulong, it may be supposed that I have not
adopted them without considerable caution & I [insertion]have[/insertion] preferred my own
results to theirs only because [deletion]I[/deletion] they have been confirmed by minute
& repeated experiments
