the light yielded by this substance

M de Berthollet [insertion]the rightly celebrated philosophical traveller in 1798[/insertion] conceived & secured
the plan of a lamp for giving

a plan similar as to insulation
was contrived by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny in 1813
but He [unclear][insertion]xxxxxxxxx[/insertion][/unclear] supplied his light
