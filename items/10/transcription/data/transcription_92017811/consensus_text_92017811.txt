It will be unnecessary to dwell further upon
preliminary & unsuccessful attempts; &
I shall proceed to describe the
origin & progress of those
investigations which led me
to the [deletion]present[/deletion] discovery of the
principles by which explosion & flame
 may be arrested or regulated & by means
[deletion]reason[/deletion] of which the miner is
not only able to subdue &
control but likewise to render useful
his most dangerous enemy. -
- I first began by a minute chemical
examinations of the substances with which
I had to contend; The analysis of
various specimens [insertion]of firedamp[/insertion] shewed no heat the
[unclear]xxx[/unclear] inflammable part of [deletion]fire damp[/deletion] it
was light carburetted Hydrogene as
[deletion]had stated[/deletion] D[superscript]r[/superscript] Henry had before stated
Hydrogene or pure inflammable air combined
with charcoal or carbon[deletion]& heat it[/deletion]
I made [deletion]various[/deletion] [insertion]numerous[/insertion] experiments on this
[deletion]degree of its inflammability & the[/deletion] circumstances
 under which it explodes & the degree of
its inflammability, -
- I found that it required to be mixed
with very large quantities of [deletion]inflam[/deletion] atmospheric
air to produce explosion [deletion]1 part of it[/deletion]
