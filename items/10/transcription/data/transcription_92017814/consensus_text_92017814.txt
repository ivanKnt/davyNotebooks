occurred to me, [deletion]that[/deletion]as a [underline]considerable[/underline] heat
was required for the inflammation of the
firedamp & [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] as it produced in burning
comparatively a [underline]small degree[/underline] of heat, that
the effect of carbonic acid & azote & of
the [deletion]metallic[/deletion] surfaces of small tubes has
prevented its explosion depended upon
 their cooling powers, upon their lowering
the temperature of the exploding mixture
so much that it was no longer
sufficient for its continuous inflammation.
- This idea which was confirmed by various
obvious considerations [deletion]immediately[/deletion] led [deletion]me[/deletion]
to an immediate [insertion]result[/insertion] [deletion]application[/deletion] "the possibility
of constructing a lamp in which the cooling
powers of the Azote [insertion]or carbonic acid formed by combustion[/insertion] [deletion]should prevent the[/deletion]
[deletion]possibility of explosion[/deletion], or [deletion]in which[/deletion] the
cooling powers of the apertures through which
the air [deletion]was[/deletion] entered or made its exit
should prevent the communication of explosions
- I first tried the effects of lamps in
which there was a very limited circulation

of air [deletion][insertion]though[/insertion] in explosive mixtures[/deletion] & [insertion]I found[/insertion] that
when a taper [insertion]in a close location[/insertion] was supplied with [deletion]its[/deletion] air so
[insertion]as to burn feebly from[/insertion] [deletion]using limited quantity of air from[/deletion] [insertion]any[/insertion] small
apertures below the flame & at a considerable
distance from it it became extinguished
in explosive mixtures - but I [deletion]even found[/deletion][insertion]ascertained[/insertion]
that [deletion]great[/deletion] fire cautions [insertion]which it would be dangerous to insist to workmen[/insertion] were required to [deletion]prevent[/deletion]
[deletion]this form of lamp from being dangerous; & that[/deletion]
make this form of lamp safe, [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] that at [deletion][/unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] best
