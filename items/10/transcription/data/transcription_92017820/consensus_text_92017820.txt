- My first safety lamps constructed on these
principles gave light in [deletion]weak[/deletion] explosive mixtures
containing a great excess of air; but became
extinguished in [deletion]strong[/deletion] explosive mixtures in which
the firedamp was in sufficient quantity to
absorb the whole of the oxygene of that air
so that [insertion]such[/insertion][deletion]explosive [insertion][deletion]these[/deletion][/insertion][/deletion] mixtures never burnt
continuously at the air feeders; which
