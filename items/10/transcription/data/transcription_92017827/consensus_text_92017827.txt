- I shall conclude this [deletion]general[/deletion] view
by some general observations on
flame & combustion which will [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
shew more distinctly the causes &
the limits of [deletion]security[/deletion] [insertion]safety[/insertion] in lamps
& which will [deletion]shew[/deletion] [insertion]demonstrate[/insertion] the danger of
combinations made with an
imperfect knowledge of the principles
of security. -
- Flame may be defined to be aeriform
or gaseous matter heated to such a
degree as to be luminous; & it may
 be produced independent of any chemical
changes as is shewn in the discharge
of voltaic electricity through an undecomposable
gas - very concentrated electricity in passing
through bodies constantly heats them whether
they be solid placed in gaseous & by
 the voltaic apparatus the nature of
flame is distinctly shewn, [deletion]it is air[/deletion]
30
[deletion]intensely heated[/deletion]. Flames are conical
because the greatest heat is in the
centre of the mass & because heated
air rapidly ascends through cooler
air - Whenever [underline]flame[/underline] is produced
in chemical combination gaseous matter
