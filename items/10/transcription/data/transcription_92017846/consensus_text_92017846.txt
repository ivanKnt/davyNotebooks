I know that [deletion]small[/deletion] [insertion]minute proportions[/insertion] [deletion]quantities[/deletion] of
phosphuretted Hydrogene were separated
from Phosphorus by Voltaic Electricity
it occurred to me as possible
that water might be formed
in the combustion of Phosphorus
& separated from the phosphoric
acid when it entered into
5
saline or metallic combinations.
To ascertain if this were the
case I passed Phosphorus [insertion]to saturation[/insertion] through
red hot lime in a green glass
tube connected with a mercurio
pneumatic apparatus the combustion
took place with vivid ignition
but [deletion]not[/deletion] no [deletion]of[/deletion] elastic fluid was produced.
