According to the second of 100

[deletion]In the third experiment the combustion[/deletion]
[deletion]was slower than in the other two.[/deletion]
The light of the Phosphorus
burning in vapour in these experiments
was exceptionally bright, yet the top
of the retort never became softened
& the phosphoric acid which increased
the weight of the tube principally combined
with the glass at the aperture where it was red hot
I cannot but consider the process of burning Phosphorus
in the gaseous state in a great excess of oxygene as the most
 accurate mode that has yet been devised for ascertaining
the composition of Phosphoric acid. In this instance
