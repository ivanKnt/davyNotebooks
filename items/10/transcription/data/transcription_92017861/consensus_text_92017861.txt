In experiments that I formerly made
on this subject by admitting
chlorine to phosphorus in
exhausted vessels & ascertaining
the absorption by introducing
solution of chlorine, I [deletion]considerably[/deletion]
 observed the [deletion]ga[/deletion] absorption I did
not at that time know what
I have since ascertained that
a solution of chlorine in water
[underline]apparently[/underline] saturated with chlorine
by agitation with it in long
[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] vessels will still take up
more by exposure to a [deletion]large[/deletion] great
surface of chlorine in larger vessels
