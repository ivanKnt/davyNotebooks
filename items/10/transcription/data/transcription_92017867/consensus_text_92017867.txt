for some time till not the slightest
inch of chlorine could be perceived
the retort was then weighed & a current
of air passed through it; though this
current could hardly have replaced
the air previously contained in the
[deletion]get it on[/deletion] retort yet the loss
of weight was 1.7 grains & copious
vapours were produced in the
Atmosphere; in a second trial
of the same kind there was
a greater loss of weight: &
by barely exhausting the retort
& then again admitting air
 there was a loss of 7/10 of a
grain. -
