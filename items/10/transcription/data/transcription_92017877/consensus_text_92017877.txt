through corrosive sublimate in great excess were acted
on by water & precipitated by nitrate of silver
the precipitate was immediately separated from the
fluid after it had been diluted greatly with
distilled water; distilled water was then repeatedly
passed through it & it was dried & fixed when
it weighed 98.4 grains - which allowing 24.5
percent of chlorine in hornsilver would give
the composition of the fluid chloride as
 24.108 of chlorine & 8.592 of Phosphorus

- The comparative quantity of precipitate in
this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was so much less than I had
found in a former experiment that notwithstanding

bottle from which no vapour could escape & in which
I superintended the weighing & drying of
the hornsilver formed with the greatest care
