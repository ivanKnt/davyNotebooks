18.4 of the liquid chloride afforded
only 54.5 of chloride of silver which
agrees as nearly as [insertion]could be expected[/insertion][deletion]possible[/deletion] with
the former exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]two other experiments made with special care & in which the liquid[/insertion]
was poured into a solution of nitrate silver; 6 grains gave 17.1 of [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
& 29.49 gave 89.9 of fixed hornsilver
In examining minutely the circumstances
of the action of the liquid chloride
or solutions containing Phosphorus &
muriatic acid on Nitrate of silver
I found no difficulty in explaining
the cause of the error in my
former exp[superscript]t[/superscript], Phosphorous acid acts upon
nitrate of silver [insertion][deletion]& produces[/deletion][/insertion] & more rapidly in
proportion to its concentration & [insertion]gradually[/insertion] produces
a copious precipitate from it so that
if there be an excess of nitrate
of silver & the precipitate is not
immediately separated from the solution
there is always a [insertion]considerable[/insertion] increase of weight
