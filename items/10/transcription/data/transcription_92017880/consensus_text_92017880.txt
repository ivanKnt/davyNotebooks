water[deletion]is[/deletion] soluble in all proportions
in the [deletion]perchlorate[/deletion] liquid chloride
this process must be very liable
to error. I have never been
able to form the perchloride even
from chlorine slowly passed through
muriate of lime without producing
a [deletion]certain[/deletion] [insertion]small[/insertion] quantity of liquid hydrat
of perchloride which when the solid
perchloride was converted into liquid
by more phosphorus rose in vapour
with it " & which containing [deletion]nearly[/deletion] [insertion]nearly[/insertion]
a double quantity of chlorine ( for the
water forms a very rich part of it)
occasions the precipitation of a
much larger quantity of [deletion]nitrate[/deletion]
hornsilver than [insertion]the[/insertion] pure chloride formed
from corrosive sublimate. -
