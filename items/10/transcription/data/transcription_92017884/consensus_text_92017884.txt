I shall give three experiments on the
quantity of Hydrate of Potash
necessary for saturating given
quantities of Phosphoric acid
made from given weights of
Phosphorus.
 18 grains of phosphorus [deletion]oxyi[/deletion] converted
into [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] Phosphoric acid by combustion
in oxygene required for its saturation
47 grains of [deletion][unclear]xxx xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] dry Hydrate
of Potash.
5.7 grains of Phosphorus
converted into acid required
14.7 of Hydrate of Potash
5 grains of Phosphorus converted
into perchloride demanded to produce perfect
