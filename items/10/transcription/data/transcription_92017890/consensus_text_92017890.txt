compaction of the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] hypophosphorous
acid it was necessary to ascertain
the composition of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the phosphate of
Baryta produced in these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] which
was easily done by precipitating
a given quantity of the Hypophosphite
of Baryta by[deletion]Sulp[/deletion] solution of sulphate
of soda. - 15 grains of Hypophosphite
of Baryta is an experiment very carefully
made afforded 11.3 of sulphate of
Baryta - now supposing this sulphate
of Baryta to contain 7.4 of Baryta
The Hypophosphite would consist of 7.4 of
Baryta and 7.6 of Hypophosphorous acid
& 13.1 of the acid Phosphate of Baryta
formed from its decomposition would
contain 5.7 Phosphoric acid & 7.4 Baryta. -
