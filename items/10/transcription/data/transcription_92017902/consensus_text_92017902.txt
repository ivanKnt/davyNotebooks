I shall conclude this paper by a few
incidental observations on the compounds
of Phosphorus.
M. Dulong states that no Phosphorous
acid is formed when Phosphorus is
 burnt in excess of oxygene & atmospheric
air as he says I have asserted.
- I cannot find that I have any where
made such an assertion: but notwithstanding
what M. Dulong pretends this assertion
is true as the following experiment will
prove, a a half a grain of Phosphorus
was set fire to in a retort
 containing sixteen cubical inches of common
 air - the acid products washed with
distilled water [insertion]& passed through a filter &[/insertion] [deletion]for which was[/deletion] evaporated
when the acid became nearly dry, small
globules of phosphuratted hydrogene were disengaged
 from it indirectly the presence of phosphorous
acid - The exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated two or
three times & care being taken to
separate [insertion]the red powder[/insertion] [deletion]using red oxide of phosph of[/deletion]
[deletion]the substance which he[/deletion] which has
been considered as an oxide of Phosphorus
& always with the same result
