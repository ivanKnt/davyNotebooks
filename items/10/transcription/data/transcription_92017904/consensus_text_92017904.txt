It has been twice carefully distiled at
a low heat it has still contained
[deletion]quanti[/deletion] minute quantities of Phosphorus
- [deletion]Then[/deletion] [insertion]It has been[/insertion] supposed that dry Phosphorus
acid is [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] fixed at a white heat
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]; but I find that this is not
the case, It [insertion]rapidly[/insertion] loses as vapour at this
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] temperature [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] & [insertion]evaporates[/insertion] even at the
point of fusion of flint glass; &
the hydrat of Phosphoric acid [deletion]slowly[/deletion]

[deletion]heat; & boils at red heat[/deletion]
[deletion]is still not capable[/deletion] susceptible of
being volatiled at a much lower
temperature.
[deletion]I shall not present exercise[/deletion]
[deletion]In converting the solid sublimate[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] composed of Phosphorus & chlorine[/deletion]
[deletion]into the liquid compound by Phosphorus[/deletion]
[deletion]when the Phosphorus is first fixed[/deletion]
[deletion]will contact with the sublimate a[/deletion]
[deletion]whi[/deletion] yellow crystaline mass is formed
which [deletion]is reached by [unclear]xx[/unclear] a[/deletion][insertion]when acted on by[/insertion] higher
degree of heat [deletion]into Phosphorus[/deletion]
affords the liquid chloride which rises from
it in vapour & leaves Phosphorus behind
- It is possible that this yellow solid is a
compound of Phosphorus & chlorine containing
half as much chlorine as the liquid; should this
be proved to be the case by future experiments, it will
give weight to the idea that hypophosphorous acid is [deletion]composed of[/deletion]
a [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] compound of oxygen & phosphorus
