[deletion]- In examining by a magnifying glass the texture of the[/deletion]
[deletion]layers as they appear in their coherent state it was evident that[/deletion]
[deletion]there was a brilliant substance generally disseminated through[/deletion]
[deletion]the MS but this substance had disappeared in the specimens[/deletion]
[deletion]that had been acted upon by ether[/deletion]
[deletion]These results rendered it almost certain that the strong[/deletion]
[deletion]adherence of the layers of the MS which offers the great difficulty[/deletion]
[deletion]to the unfolding them is owing to an asphaltic substance which[/deletion]
[deletion]has formed during the decomposition and that the removal of this[/deletion]
[deletion]will render the [insertion]separating of the[/insertion] layers comparatively easy[/deletion]
[deletion]I tried several experiments as to the best mode of[/deletion]
[deletion]destroying this natural cement which has so long closed up these[/deletion]
[deletion]remains of ancient literature - The fluid solvents I found by[/deletion]
[deletion]their weight produced an irregular separation of the layers and in[/deletion]
[deletion]drying the leaves after their application they were always found[/deletion]
[deletion]deranged or broken This created a difficulty It was necessary[/deletion]
[deletion]that the substances to be applied should be gaseous so that[/deletion]
[deletion]its weight or mechanical agency should not interfere and that[/deletion]
[deletion]it should destroy the cement without acting on carbonaceous[/deletion]
