almost [deletion]almost[/deletion] all compounds containing hydrogen and have
no effect upon charcoal - I gently heated some of the matter
separated from the fragments by ether in chlorine and I found
that it was rapidly decomposed and afforded muriatic acid

and I had the satisfaction to find that they separated from each
