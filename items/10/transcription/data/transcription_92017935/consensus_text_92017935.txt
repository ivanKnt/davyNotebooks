containing a piece of a roll with its layers perpendicular

it arrived at redness the unfolding was perfect and regular
In this instance the [deletion]chlorine[/deletion] [insertion]iodine[/insertion] enters between the layers

[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]extractive or hydrocarbonous substance[/insertion] and forms [deletion]muriatic acid[/deletion] [insertion]hydroodic gas[/insertion] which during its
expulsion by heat tends to render the separation more perfect
and nothing remains but the charcoal of the layers and that of
the letters the colours of which are perfectly distinct
[deletion]The more applications of heat without chlorine[/deletion]

[deletion]the heat must be raised to ascertain [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] and the elastic fluid is[/deletion]

[deletion]has been employed and if the MSS should all have undergone[/deletion]
[deletion]the same changes as the fragments I have examined I have no[/deletion]
[deletion]doubt but that the operation of chlorine and heat or even[/deletion]
[deletion]heat alone continuously and slowly applied in the manner I[/deletion]
[deletion]have described will offer very great facility in unrolling them[/deletion]
I should recommend according to the suggestion of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Young
