I exposed a small quantity of each of these
fragments to the proof of distilation
& I found that they all gave off elastic
fluid; the brownest in largest proportion
which proved to be of the same nature
as coal gas: & this afforded different
proportions of a coloured fluid which had
a bituminous smell & contained ammonia
partly neutralised by acetic acid. -
