depended on a great measure upon
a bituminous or extractive substance
similar to those which form in peat or
wood coal & which by being dipped though
the substance of the MSS offered an
obstacle to the development of separate
 leaves.
I tried several experiments as to the best
mode of destroying this natural cement
which has so long closed up these
remains of ancient literature. The
fluid solvents, I found by their weight
produced an irregular separation of
the layers; - yet with [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] proper precautions
I have no doubt they might be used,
in rare cases, particularly for acting upon
the exterior [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] parts with great success.
- I tried the operation of heat,
in close vessels, I found that when it was
rapidly raised, the elastic fluids formed
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] burst through the folds of the
MS & destroyed a part, but by applying
it very slowly & keeping the fragment of the
MS; with the direction of the layers perpendicular
the cement was decomposed without injuring
the texture of the layers of the papyrus & the
