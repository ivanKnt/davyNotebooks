Having witnessed some of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Sickler's attempts to
unfold the Herculaneum Manuscripts it occurred to me that
a chemical examination of the nature of the Manuscripts
and of the changes they had undergone might offer some data
as to the best methods to be attempted for unrolling them
On mentioning this to Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt he obligingly put
into my hands[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] fragments of [insertion]two MS one of which had been operated upon by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hayter & the other by D[superscript]r[/superscript]Sickler &[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] which (the principal
parts being destroyed) were [unclear]chosen[/unclear] to be sacrificed to experiment
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Young likewise gave one [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] small portion of a MS which had been placed in

and in the course of my experiments ascertained several
facts which throw considerable light on this interesting inquiry
and which I have every reason to hope will facilitate the
means of laying open to the literary world the contents that
shall exist of these precious remains of antiquity
