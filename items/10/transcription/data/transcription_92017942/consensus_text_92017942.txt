which has taken place in the papyrus is owing to the slow
operation of natural causes - on endeavouring to separate
the layers of the papyrus in which the characters exist there
appeared an evident adhesion depending upon some substance
diffused through the leaves of the MS - From the smell
emitted by the fragments when heated it occurred to me
that this substance might be bituminous or [deletion]its nature[/deletion]
asphaltic similar to that which is usually found in wood
partially converted into coal.
To determine this I exposed a portion of one of the
fragments to heat in close vessels and I found that it gave
off a considerable quantity of inflammable gas similar
in its nature to coal gas which could not have been the
case had it been pure charcoal. It afforded likewise an
ammoniacal empyreumatic fluid smelling strongly of
naphtha and partly neutralise by acetous acid - on distilling
the smallest portion of the manuscript the same produc
were evolved so that there was evidently some asphaltic matter
in them capable of being decomposed by heat
I endeavoured to ascertain its nature by various
chemical tests and to separate it without injuring the texture
 of the MS. I found that alcohol did not dissolve it nor boiling
water but sulphuric ether became slightly coloured by being
kept long in contact with a piece of MS and when
evaporated left a yellow matter which on being decom-
 posed by heat had the smell of asphalt mixed with a
peculiar aromatic smell and was highly inflammable
