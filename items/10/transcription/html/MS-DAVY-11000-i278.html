         <p>An element and the heaviest of the group of stable halogens. Bernard Courtois was
            the first to isolate the&nbsp;substance. Whilst in Paris&nbsp;Davy&nbsp;investigated the&nbsp;substance,&nbsp;and&nbsp;proved
            it to be a chemical&nbsp;element&nbsp;describing his results in a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;the Royal Society.
            This caused disputes between Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who had also been researching
            the element.</p>
