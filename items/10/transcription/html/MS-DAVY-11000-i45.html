            it to be a chemical&nbsp;element&nbsp;describing his results in a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;the Royal Society.
            This caused disputes between Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who had also been researching

            with sulphuric acid. The unidentified substance was first shown to be an element in
            1810 by André-Marie Ampère, and subsequently proven by Davy. The element came to be
            named fluorine through its commonly-known compound of fluorspar. </p>
