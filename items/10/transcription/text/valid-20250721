[underline]Davy's Papers [/underline]
This volume and a similar one
[unclear]Post[/unclear] size contain certain original papers of
Sir H. Davy. I had to copy these, the first rough
papers, which were then usually destroyed:
until I begged to have them as a remem-
brance of the Man & the places when they were
written. My request was granted and these
with the exception of one or two in my copy of
the Life of Davy are what  I thus saved
from destruction

It is generally known that some [underline]weeks[/underline]
[underline]after[/underline] Sir  H Davy's discourses respecting
safety lamps for miners was published it was
Said at Newcastle that a person of
the name of Stephenson had independently
of Sir H Davy invented a lamp upon
upon the same or upon a similar principle
but the claims of this person [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] not
being supported either by [deletion]from[/deletion] philosophical or
Common evidence met with no attention
[insertion]from the scientific world[/insertion] till they were brought forward by the
Mess[superscript]s[/superscript] Brandling at Newcastle for the
purpose of robbing Sir H Davy of the
very principle of his discovery, when they
were examined by the president [insertion]of the Royal Society[/insertion] & some
of the most distinguished chemical and philosophical
Men belonging to that Association & likewise
by the great body of the Coal owners of
the Tyne & Weare & not only rejected
[deletion]but accompanied with an opinion[/deletion]
but rejected in a manner which attached
a charge of philosophical piracy to M[superscript]r[/superscript]
George Stephenson; [deletion]the Mess[superscript]s[/superscript] Brandling[/deletion]. A
Committee of M[superscript]r[/superscript] George Stephensons friends
have endeavoured to repel this charge
in a pamphlet to which is annexed
all the evidence in [insertion]his[/insertion] favor [deletion]of M[superscript]r[/superscript] George[/deletion]

[deletion]Stephenson[/deletion] that could be collected.- From this
evidence the nature of his experiments
& of the apparatus He used may be
learnt & his pretensions minutely
examined.-
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Geoerge Stephenson has stated that
before he had heard of Sir H Davy's
discoveries, He had invented three
lamps all of which [insertion]He said[/insertion] might be safely
used to give light in explosive atmospheres.
- A model of the first of these lamps
has been procured from M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hogg
of Newcastle & which He stated to be [deletion]exactly[/deletion]
[deletion]the same[/deletion][insertion]similar[/insertion] to that used by M[superscript]r[/superscript]
George Stephenson [insertion]another model exact in the size of the tube &[/insertion] a model of the second
have been made for M[superscript]r[/superscript] Newman; &
a model of the third exists in
the Royal Institution, it was bought
for the Wallsend colliery; the following
details as furnished by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Faraday

& admits of a free circulation of air;
the glass vessel which forms the interior
of the lamp is [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] retained in its place
merely by a tin rim without being made
air tight.- The tube at the bottom
which ought to have been half an
inch in diameter has been made
inadvertently [insertion]it is said[/insertion] only a quarter of an
inch the size originally intended by
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Stephenson when his idea was to use
a tube without a slider.-
- This lamp burns tolerably well [deletion]when[/deletion]
[deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] tube [underline]being entirely closed[/underline] when at rest
but then easily goes out by motion.
It [deletion]even[/deletion]burns though more fully when
the [underline]bottom is made airtight[/underline] & the tube
closed, there being a sufficient circulation
of air through the open top - When
it was made so far air tight as to
have a current only [deletion]fro[/deletion] through the tube
& the top of it constantly fired explosive
atmospheres when ever it would burn
& even when the aperture was so narrowed
by the slider as not to supply sufficient
air to support the flame of the smallest

extinguished into an explosive atmosphere.
- [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion] In M[superscript]r[/superscript] Newmans model the tube
was half an inch, the top was
narrower & the glass smaller so that
the top became very hot & there
was a much stronger draught
through the tube - By this lamp
even when the slider was closed to 1/8
explosions were communicated; & even
when there was not a sufficient
supply of air to permit a light
to burn; & [deletion]the[/deletion] when the light
was burning with its smallest quantity
of air it was extinguished by a
contamination of  fire damp [deletion]not sufficient[/deletion]

[deletion]gas issuing from a pipe into the atmosphere the gas[/deletion]

[deletion]within the lamp fed with air from above If the size of [/deletion]
[deletion]the aperture was enlarged it became necessary to pass the lamp[/deletion]
[deletion]more quickly because the atmosphere in the tube or air feeder[/deletion]
[deletion]changed its place more rapidly and on the contrary if the[/deletion]
[deletion]lamp was made to approach the gas pipe more slowly[/deletion]
[deletion]so that it should be placed successfully in the various at-[/deletion]

[deletion]lamp made exactly similar in their effects with those above[/deletion]
[deletion]described[/deletion]
[underline]Experiments with M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Stevensons second lamp[/underline]
This lamp was made like the other except that
wick was placed in the middle of it as is represented
in his plate and three tubes around it exactly of the
dimensions and figure of those described in the report of
the committee The lamp was lighted and the top [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
the flame gradually diminished and as soon as the air
contained in the lamp was exhausted went out: It was
repeatedly lighted but by no device could it be made to
burn; tubes of this diameter length and curvature not per
mitting a sufficient circulation of air It is evident therefore
that this lamp could have burned only in consequence of a
admission of air from some other source than the tubes
A lamp was tried upon the model of the tube
lamp [deletion]figured in M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Stevensons pamphlet with a cylindrical[/deletion] [insertion]so as to burn feebly by a descending current[/insertion]
[deletion]top perforated with holes. This lamp burned from a descending[/deletion]
[deletion]current of air as was proved by putting the lower part in [/deletion] [insertion]of air. This lamp as[/insertion]
[deletion]water to close the tubes and as[/deletion] might be expected when
placed in an explosive atmosphere instantly fired it
[underline]Experiments with M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Stevensons third lamp[/underline]
The apertures in the top of the lamp are very nearly
3/10 of an inch in diameter Those in the bottom being punched
in tolerably thick copper are of different diameters at the
surface of the plate and the extremity of the burr when
measured by callipers at their upper diameters some of these
are 1/8 of an inch but if gauged by passing wires of different
thicknesses through them so as to measure their lower [unclear]diam[/unclear]
few of them equal 1/12 of an inch and only one equalled
the greater number are between one twelfth and one [deletion]fifteenth[/deletion][insertion]fourteenth[/insertion]

of an inch wide. All the larger holes below were stopped
up in this lamp yet it passed the explosion as readily as
before and such was its facility of communicating inflam-
mation that when slowly brought near a tube from which
gas was issuing into the atmosphere it inflamed the gas
on the outside of the lamp
It is evident from this experiment that no one
of these [underline]original[/underline] lamps of M[superscript]r[/superscript] G Stevenson could have been
[deletion]a safe lamp[/deletion] [insertion]used in explosive atmospheres[/insertion] and that no conclusions concerning safe operations
could have been deduced from them.-
- They may be all of them be made to burn
firedamp or pure carburetted Hydrogene
by being placed over small blowers;[deletion]&[/deletion]
but for this purpose the slider [deletion]& th[/deletion]
of the tube lamps must be partially
closed or it must be very rapidly
passed through the explosive medium
whenever an explosive atmosphere can
enter the [deletion]holes[/deletion] [deletion]apertures[/deletion] air feeders
explosion [insertion]is always communicated[/insertion] to the external atmosphere.
[deletion]in glass[/deletion] These results have been witnessed in
different fires & all different times
by a number of [deletion]the most distinguished[/deletion]
[deletion]philosophers[/deletion] persons both scientific &
unscientific & may be seen at
any time - Amongst those who have
witnessed them are

they have been tried with similar
results both with common coal gas
& purified carbureted hydrogene.-
A [underline]few observations[/underline] on M[superscript]r[/superscript] Stevenson's
claims [underline]by a practical chemist[/underline]
From every thing that has been
said for M[superscript]r[/superscript] Stevenson & from his own
evidence it is clear that his object
in his first lamps was to make
an apparatus for burning firedamp from
[insertion]blowers[/insertion] & consuming it as a gas light in
the mines; & his first three lamps
are merely gas light burners with
wicks to light the gas except that
the common gas light burners used
in London would have been [deletion]exp[/deletion]much
[insertion]safer[/insertion] in explosive atmospheres as their apertures
are so much smaller; there is certainly
ingenuity in his idea of lighting the
gas by a wick round the tube or
close to the apertures, & if nothing
but his evidence which [insertion]appears to have been[/insertion] given upon
oath [insertion]late in 1817[/insertion] had been published by him
though his experiments had nothing to
do with explosive mixtures; the current

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00031|dnp10027pp|92017687[/page]
of explosions by [unclear]small apertures[/unclear]
or [insertion]miners[/insertion] safety lamps for using in explosive
atmospheres yet still their merit would
have been allowed; but unfortunately
for M[superscript]r[/superscript] George Stevenson He published
a pamphlet early in 1817 [deletion]in[/deletion] which
is contradictory of his evidence &
in which He endeavours to identify
his [deletion]his[/deletion]results with those of Sir
H Davy by giving false engraving
& descriptions of his lamps. - He has
given his lamps the form of the wire
gauze safe lamp; has pretended that
his first tube lamp was furnished with
a top [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] perforated with small holes
that his second tube lamp had
a case furnished with small holes &
a safety trimmer which is known to
be false: & that his third lamp
had [deletion][unclear]safe[/unclear][/deletion] two [unclear]safe[/unclear] canals & a [unclear]texture[/unclear] below
& above like wire gauze and a safety
screw & safety trimmer;- [deletion]which in his[/deletion]
all of which are gross instances of
imposture.
Even with respect to dates his own

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00032|dnp10028pp|92017688[/page]
14
assertions prove that his experiments
on burning firedamp were posterior
to those of Sir H Davy in a real
safety lamp.-
That a committee of country gentlemen
assisted by a druggist of Newcastle
should not form very just ideas
respecting the nature of flame & explosion
& of the principles of which they may be
arrested is natural enough; & that they
should wish to reward an ingenious
mechanic even more than He deserves
does not render them obnoxious to
censure; but that they should [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] keep
their names [insertion]attached to an[/insertion][deletion]to an acknowledged[/deletion]
[deletion]fraudulent[/deletion] attempt now proved by
the contrast between M[superscript]r[/superscript] Stephensons pamphlet
& his evidence to be founded upon
falsehood & piracy is astonishing.
- The Mess[superscript]s[/superscript]Brandling [insertion]& their friends[/insertion] use[deletion]d[/deletion] Sir H Davys
wire gauze gas lamps in its common
form in their mines. Lord Strathmore
& his partners use an imperfect & not a [unclear]xx[/unclear]
form of Sir H Davy's lamp - he further
will decide who is guilty of [unclear]illiterating[/unclear]

benefits on those who receive them
with indifference [deletion]&[/deletion][insertion]or[/insertion] repay them with

In a work published in 1812, I have pointed
out some of the analogies between the
substances considered in the present
state of our knowledge as undecompounded
& I have endeavored to found a
classification upon these [deletion][unclear]xxxxx similarity[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion]analogies.
I [deletion]classed[/deletion][insertion]placed[/insertion] oxygene & chlorine together [deletion]as empyrical[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]empyri[/deletion] substances eminently supporting[/deletion] [insertion]because in combining with inflammable[/insertion]
[deletion]combustion[/deletion] bodies & metals, they produce
heat & light in a much higher degree
than any other known species of matter &
because [insertion]many of[/insertion] their compounds are possessed of
analogous chemical & electrical qualities
At the same time I[deletion]have[/deletion] stated that
there is a general claim of resemblances
between all the chemical elements
& that while sulphur is analogous to
chlorine in one of its properties, it
[deletion]is important to[/deletion] possesses more [deletion]of[/deletion] general
resemblances to Phosphorus.
The progress of chemical discovery since
that time has added new links in
the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] system of analogies & modified
some of the ancient truths, [deletion][unclear]xxx xxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

Metals indeed it may be said

He has adopted without acknowledgement*

of the calculations upon the composition
of the compounds of chlorine given in [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] three

stronger analogy between chlorine Iodine &
Sulphur, than between the same bodies

be separated as a class from oxygene

I do not admit the force of his
reasoning on this subject, the[deletion]y have[/deletion] [insertion]bodies to which[/insertion] He refers have
only one marked point of resemblance to

He & M. Thenard first advanced the hypothesis
that chlorine was a simple body & that
He was the first person to demonstrate the
nature of Iodine: & he quotes M Ampere

Sulphur that which I have mentioned above
& they differ from it in their electrical
relations & in the chemical & electrical
nature of all their other compounds,
& agree in these respects with oxygene.
- Like oxygene in Voltaic arrangements
they are determined to the positive surface
- whereas Sulphur is separated at the
negative surface; the[deletion]y[/deletion] compounds they
form with metals strongly resemble
those formed by oxygene; they are
[deletion]nonconducting[/deletion] electrics & many of them
soluble in water & possessed of acid
properties whereas those formed by
Sulphur are all non electrics & insoluble

I have always vindicated the claims of Scheele
but I must assume for myself the labour of having demonstrated its properties [insertion] & combin[unclear]x[/unclear] & of having explained the chemical phenomena it produces[/insertion]
& I shall quote a passage from the English

Ampere which shews that He has no claim
of this kind to make
With respect to the nature of fluoric

it cannot exist.- He supposes
that this acid of 1 proportion

no neither can the Nitric or

is perfectly obvious. An acid

- The substitution of analogy for fact

its legitimate use is to connect

As I cannot adopt M Gay

I approve of his nomenclature
- To call the compounds of Chlorine

to place Chlorine & Iodine
in the class of inflammable
bodies - & I prefer to these
denominations clorids and iodes
- M Gay Lussac has called
Sulphuretted hydrogene Hydrosulphuric

been applied to [deletion]oil of vitriol[/deletion]
[deletion]or to [/deletion]sulphuric acid the oil

Hydrochloric acid would signify
chloric acid combined with

M Gay Lussac's own views is
more applicable to his

strictly signifies acids combined

a compound of platinum &
Cyanogen was formed at

Notice of some experiments & new views
[underline]respecting flames[/underline] By Sir [underline]H. Davy.-[/underline]
When a wire gauze safe lamp is made to
burn in a very explosive mixture of coal gas & air, the light
is feeble & of a pale blue colour; whereas the flame
of a current of coal gas burnt in the atmosphere;
as is well known by the phenomena of the gas
lights, is extremely brilliant. In a paper read
before the Royal Society, I have endeavoured to shew,
that in all cases flame is a continued combustion
of explosive mixtures; it became, therefore, a problem
of some interest; "Why the combustion of explosive
mixtures of the same substances under different
circumstances, should produce such different appearances."
A very acute philosopher, who himself started the subject
in conversation, suggested the idea, that in the
combustion of explosive mixtures within the lamp
carbonic oxide might be formed; & that the light
might be deficient, from the deficiency of the quantity of
oxygene necessary to produce carbonic acid.- On
submitting this idea to the test of experiment, it was
discovered to be unfounded; for by the combustion in
the wire-gauze lamp, carbonic acid was produced in
quantities as great as could have been expected from
the quantity of oxygene consumed; & on adding oxygene
to [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]a mixture in quantities more than sufficient to
burn the whole of the gas, the character of the light
still continued the same.
In reflecting on he circumstances of the two species of
combustion, I was led to imagine that the cause of
the superiority of the light of the [underline]stream[/underline] of coal gas might
be owing to the [underline]decomposition[/underline] of a part of the gas
towards the interior of the flame where the oxygene was
in smallest quantity, & the deposition of solid charcoal

[page]74|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00074|dnp10070pp|92017730[/page]
56
which, first by [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] ignition[/deletion] its [underline]ignition[/underline] & afterwards
by its [underline]combustion[/underline], increased in a high degree
the intensity of the light; & a few experiments
soon convinced me that this was the true solution
of the problem.-
I held a piece of wire-gauze of about 900
apertures to the square inch over a stream
of coal gas issuing from a small pipe, &
inflamed the gas above the wire gauze;
which was almost in contact with the
orifice of the pipe; when it burned with its
usual bright light; [deletion]-[/deletion] On raising the wire-gauze
so as to cause the gas to be mixed with
more air before it inflamed, the light
became feebler; & at a certain distance
the flame assumed the precise character of
that of an explosive mixture burning within
the lamp; but though the light was so feeble
in this last case, the heat was greater than when
the light was much more vivid, & a piece of
wire of platinum held in this feeble blue flame
became instantly white hot.-
On reversing the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] by inflaming a stream of
Coal gas, & passing a piece of wire gauze
gradually from the summit of the flame to
the orifice of the pipe, the result was still
more instructive; for it was found that the
apex of the flame intercepted by the wire
gauze afforded no solid charcoal, but in
passing it downwards, solid charcoal was given
off in considerable quantities, & prevented from

[page]75|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00075|dnp10071pp|92017731[/page]
57
burning by the cooling agency of the wire-gauze;
& at the bottom of the flame where the gas burnt blue
in its immediate contact with the atmosphere, charcoal
ceased to be deposited in visible quantities.-
- This principle of the increase of the brilliancy
& density of flame by the production & ignition
of solid matter, appears to admit of many
applications. I have commenced the experimental
investigation of some of them; but as my enquiries
are still unfinished, I shall hint only at
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the most obvious of the views
connected with them. On a future occasion
I hope to be able to pursue at full length this
interesting subject.-
1[superscript]st[/superscript] The principle explains readily [deletion]explain[/deletion] the
appearances of the different parts of the flames of burning
bodies, & of flame [unclear]urged[/unclear] by the blow pipe: the point
of the inner blue flame, where the heat is greatest,
is the point where the whole of the charcoal is burnt
in its gaseous combinations without previous deposition.-
2. It explains the intensity of the light of those
[underline]flames[/underline] in which [underline]fixed[/underline] solid matter is produced
in combustion, such as that of the flame of
Phosphorus & of Zinc in oxygene, &c. & of
Potassium in chlorine; & the feebleness of the
light of those flames in which gaseous or volatile
matter alone is produced, such as those of
Hydrogene & Sulphur in oxygene, phosphorus in
chlorine &c.
3 it offers means of increasing the light of certain

[page]76|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00076|dnp10072pp|92017732[/page]
58
burning substances, by placing in their flames even
incombustible substances. Thus the intensity of
the light of burning sulphur, Hydrogene, carbonic
oxide &c. is wonderfully increased by throwing into
them oxide of Zinc, or by placing in them
very fine amianthus or metallic gauze.-
4: It leads to deductions respecting the
chemical nature of bodies & various phenomena
of their decomposition. Thus Ether burns with
a flame which seems to indicate the presence
of olefiant gas in that substance. Alcohol burns
with a flame similar to that of a mixture of
carbonic oxide & hydrogene; so that the first is
probably a binary compound of olefiant gas & water
& the second of carbonic acid & hydrogene.-
When [deletion]Cuprine[/deletion][insertion]Cuprane[/insertion] or protochlorid of copper is introduced into
the flame of a candle or lamp, it affords a peculiar
dense & brilliant red light, tinged with green & blue
towards the edges, which seems to depend upon the chlorine
being separated from the copper by the hydrogene, &
the ignition or combustion of the solid copper & charcoal.
Similar explanations may be given to the phenomena
presented by the action of other combinations of
chlorine on flame; & it is probable that in many
of those cases when the colour of flame is changed
by the introduction of incombustible compounds that
the effect depends upon the production & subsequent
ignition or combustion of inflammable matter from them.
Thus the rose coloured light given to flame by the
compounds of Strontium and Calcium, & the yellow colour
given by those of Barium, & the green by those
of Borion may depend upon a temporary production
of these bases by the inflammable action of the flame.

Whenever a flame is remarkably brilliant & dense, it
may be always concluded that some solid matter
is produced in it: on the contrary, when a flame
is extremely feeble & transparent, it may be inferred
that no solid matter is formed. Thus none of the
volatile combinations of sulphur burn with a
flame in the slightest degree opaque; & consequently,
there is no reason from the phaenomena of its flame
to suspect the existence of any fixed basis in Sulphur.
5. These views will probably offer illustrations
of electrical light. The Voltaic arc of flame
from the great battery, differs in colour & intensity
according to the substances employed in the circuit;
& is infinitely more brilliant & dense with
charcoal than with any other substances.- May not
this depend upon particles of the substances separated
by the electrical attractions ? & the particles of
charcoal being the lightest amongst solid bodies
( as their elementary proportional number shews ) &
the least coherent, would be separated in the
largest quantities.-
6. The heat of flames may be actually
diminished by increasing their light (at least
the heat communicable to other matter) & vice
versa.- The flame which produces the most
intense heat amongst those I have examined,
is that of a mixture of oxygene & hydrogene in
slight excess compressed in [misc]misc_775|Newmans blowpipe[/misc]
apparatus, & inflamed from a small aperture.
This flame is hardly visible in sunshine, yet it
instantly fuses very refractory bodies; & the light
from solid matters ignited in it, is so vivid
as to be painful to the eye,-

Some Researches on Flame
by Sir H Davy LLD VPRI FRS
I have described in two papers which the
Royal Society have honoured with a place in their
transactions [insertion]a number of [/insertion][deletion]various[/deletion] experiments on combustion which
show that the explosion of gaseous mixtures [insertion]can[/insertion] [deletion]could[/deletion] be pre
vented or arrested by various cooling influences, and
which led me to discover a tissue permeable to light
and air but impermeable to flame on which I
founded the invention of the wire gauze lamp now
generally used in all collieries in which inflammable
air prevails for the preservation of the lives & persons
of the miners - In a short notice published in the
third number of the Journal of Science and the Arts
edited at the Royal Institution I have given an account
of some new results on flame which shew that the intensity
of the light of flames depends principally upon the production
and ignition of solid matter in combustion and that the
heat and light in this process are in a great measure
independant phenomena. - Since this notice has been
printed I have made a number of [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] researches on flame
and as they appeared to me to throw some new light on
this important subject and to lead to some practical
views connected with the useful arts I shall without
any further apology present them to the Royal Society.
That greater distinctness may exist in the
details I shall treat of my subjects under four head. In

1[superscript]st[/superscript] [underline]On the effect of rarefaction by partly re[/underline]
[underline]moving the pressure of the atmosphere upon flame[/underline]
[underline]and explosion[/underline]
The earlier experiments upon the Boylean
vacuum observed that flame ceased in highly rarefied air
but the degree of rarefaction necessary for this effect has
been differently stated. Amongst late experiments M de
Grotthuss has examined this subject He has asserted that
a mixture of oxygene and hydrogene ceases to be explosive
by the electrical spark when rarefied 16 times and that a
mixture of chlorine and hydrogene cannot be exploded
when rarefied only 6 times and he generalises by supposing
that rarefaction whether produced by removing pressure or by
heat has the same effect
[deletion]The results of many of my experiments are en[/deletion] [insertion]I shall not [deletion]at present[/deletion] begin by discussing[/insertion]

The earlier experimenters upon the Boylean
vacuum observed that flame ceased
in highly rarefied air; that the degree
of rarefaction necessary for this effect
has been differently stated - Amongst
late experimenters M de Grotthuss has
examined this subject; He has [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] asserted
that a mixture of oxygene & Hydrogene
ceases to be explosive [insertion]by the electrical spark[/insertion] [deletion]at[/deletion] when rarefied
[deletion]to 1/16[/deletion] 1/16 times & that a mixture
of Chlorine & hydrogene cannot be exploded
when rarefied only 6 times; & He
generalizes by supposing that rarefaction
whether [deletion]by[/deletion] produced by removing pressure
or by heat has the same effect.
- The results of [deletion]my[/deletion] [insertion]many of my[/insertion] experiments are [deletion]for the most[/deletion]
[deletion]part[/deletion]entirely opposite to those of this ingenious
author & my conclusions consequently altogether
[deletion]very [/deletion]different; there is indeed only
one point in which I can agree
with him [deletion]that[/deletion] & which has been
long established namely that at a certain

[deletion]- If a mixture of dilute Vitriolic acid[/deletion]
[deletion]If a mix[/deletion]If hydrogene gas [insertion]slowly[/insertion] produced
from a [insertion]proper[/insertion] mixture be inflamed at a
fine orifice of a glass tube as in
the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] called the philosophical
candle so as to make a jet
of flame of about 1/6 of an inch
in height & introduced under the
receiver of an pump containing from
200 to 300 cubic inches of air
it will inlarge as the receiver is
exhausted, & when the gage indicates
[deletion]an exhaustion[/deletion] a pressure of about 1/4 is at
its maximum of size; it then gradually
diminishes below but burns above the
jet till the exhaustion is to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] 1/7
1/8 when it becomes extinguished.-
- This effect doe not depend upon
the [deletion]consumption[/deletion] [insertion]deficiency[/insertion] of oxygene for by
using a larger jet it will
burn longer ie till the exhaustion

is to 1/10 but it depends upon the
circumstance that the [underline]heat[/underline] produced
by the combustion in such rarefied
air is not sufficient to continue
the process: which is proved by the
following facts.- A piece of wire
of platinum was placed [deletion]in a[/deletion]
round the tube which [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] the jet
& coiled round the top of it so
as reach into the flame & above
the flame - the jet [deletion]was[/deletion] of gas of 1/6
[insertion]of an inch in height[/insertion] was lighted & the exhaustion made
- The wire of platinum soon became
white hot in the center of the flame
& a small point of wire near the top
fused: it continued white hot till
the exhaustion was to 1/6 when the
exhaustion was to 1/10 it continued
red hot at the upper part &
& as long as it continued dull
red, the gas through extinguished
below continued to burn on contact
with the [deletion]red[/deletion] hot wire & the
combustion did not cease till the

exhaustion were to 1/13 -
According to this view it must
be evident that those combustible
bodies which require least heat
for their combustion will burn [deletion]with[/deletion]
[deletion]largest[/deletion] in [deletion]rarefied the most[/deletion] [insertion]the mos[/insertion]t rarefied
atmospheres & those that produce
much heat in their combustion
will burn [deletion]larger[/deletion] other circumstances
being the same in more rarefied
air than those that produce little
heat & every exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that I have
made confirms these conclusions.
- This olefiant gas which approaches
nearly hydrogene in the heat produced
by its combustion & which does not
require a much higher temperature
for its inflammation becomes extinguished
when the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] exhaustion is to 1/8
[deletion][unclear]xxx or xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] & the flame of alcohol
& the taper which [deletion]produce[/deletion] require a greater
[deletion]higher[/deletion][insertion]consumption of heat[/insertion][deletion]temperature[/deletion] for the volatilization
& decomposition of their combustible matter

[insertion]A[/insertion] It appears from this result
that y[superscript]e[/superscript] flame of Hydrogene is
extinguished in rarefied
atmospheres only when the
heat it produces is insufficient
to keep up the combustion
which appears to be when
it is incapable of [deletion]heating[/deletion]
communicating visible ignition
to metal & as this is
the temperature required
for the inflammation of
hydrogene at common pressure
it appears that its
[underline]combustibility[/underline] is neither
diminished nor increased
by rarefaction from the
removal of pressure

as in the experiment called the Philosophical candle so as
to make a jet of flame of about 1/6 of an inch in [deletion]length[/deletion]
height and introduced under the receiver of an air pump
containing from 200 to 300 cubical inches of air [deletion]it will[/deletion] [insertion]the flame[/insertion]
enlarged as the receiver [deletion]is[/deletion][insertion]became[/insertion] exhausted and when the gage indicated

[insertion][unclear]xx xxxxx[/unclear][/insertion] extinguished.
[deletion]This[/deletion] [insertion]To ascertain whether the[/insertion] effect [deletion]does not[/deletion] depend[insertion]ed[/insertion] upon the deficiency of
oxygene: [deletion]for by[/deletion] I us[deletion]ing[/deletion][insertion]ed[/insertion] a larger jet with the same apparatus [deletion]it will burn longer i.e. till[/deletion]
[deletion]the pressure is 1/10 but it depends upon the circumstance[/deletion] [insertion]when the flame [deletion]burn[/deletion] to my surprise burned [underline]longer[/underline][/insertion]
[deletion]that the heat produced by the combustion in such rarefied[/deletion] [insertion]& when the atmosphere was rarefied to 1/10 & this[/insertion]
[deletion]air is not sufficient to continue the process which is proved [/deletion] [insertion]in repeated trials. - When the larger jet was used[/insertion]
[deletion]by the following facts. |_A piece of wire of platinum was[/deletion] the point of the glass tube became white hot & continued red hot
[deletion]placed round the tube which emitted the jet and coiled[/deletion] till the flame was extinguished. [insertion]It [insertion]immediately[/insertion] occurred to me that the heat communicated to the gas by this tubes the reason that the[/insertion]
combustion continued longer in the last trials. When [insertion]the larger flame was used & the following exp[superscript]t[/superscript] confirmed the conclusion, A piece of wire of platinum [/insertion] round the top of it so as to reach into & above the flame
the jet of gas of 1/6 of an inch in height was lighted and the
exhaustion mad the wire of platinum soon became
white hot in the centre of the flame and a small point
of wire placed near the top fused: It continued white hot till
the pressure was but 1/6 when it was 1/10 it continued red
hot at the upper part and as long as it continued dull red
the gas though extinguished below continued to burn in contact
with the hot wire and the combustion did not cease till the
pressure was reduced to 1/13th.
According to this view [insertion]with respect to hydrogene[/insertion] it [insertion][deletion]ought to follow[/deletion] should follow[/insertion] [deletion]must be evident[/deletion] that
[deletion]these[/deletion] [insertion]amongst other[/insertion] combustible bodies [insertion]those[/insertion] which require least heat for this combustion-

Phosphorus has been shewn

The mixture of Chlorine & hydrogene

that it would bear a greater

is actually the case contrary

to the assertion of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Grotthuss.
- oxygene & hydrogene in the proportion
required to form water will not
explode [deletion]when[/deletion] by the electrical spark
when rarefied to 1/20: but Hydrogene
& chlorine [deletion]exploded[/deletion] in the proportion
to form Muriatic acid gas gave
a [deletion]brilliant[/deletion] a distinct flash of
light [deletion]which[/deletion] under the same[deletion] agency[/deletion]
circumstances; & they combined
with visible inflammation when
the exhaustion was to 1/24.-
- The experiment[insertion] on the flame of hydrogene[/insertion] with the [deletion]plat[/deletion] wire
of platinum shews that by
preserving heat in rarefied air or
giving heat to a mixture inflammation
may be continued when under common
circumstances it would be extinguished.
This I found [deletion]likewise was the[/deletion] was
the case in many other instances
Thus when camphor was burnt in
a glass tube so as to make the
upper part of the tube red hot, the

inflammation continued when the
vacuum was to 1/9 whereas it
could only continue to 1/6 when it
was burnt [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] in a thick
metallic tube which could not be
considerably heated by it.
- By bringing a little naphtha in
contact with a red hot iron
it inflamed when there remained
in the receiver only 1/30 of the
original quantity of air.-
I rarefied a mixture of oxygene
& Hydrogene by the air pump till
they could no longer be inflamed
by the electrical spark. I then
heated strongly the upper part
of [insertion]the[/insertion] tube till the glass began
to soften [deletion]&, I then[/deletion][insertion]I then[/insertion] passed the spark
when a feeble flash was observed
[deletion]in the upper part of the tube[/deletion] [insertion]not reaching far into the tube[/insertion]
the heated gasses only appearing
to enter into inflammation.-
[deletion]This experiment does not always [/deletion]
[deletion]succeed.[/deletion]

and produces a considerable degree of heat in combustion it was
therefore probable that it would [deletion]burn[/deletion] bear a greater degree of
rarefaction without having its power of exploding destroyed and this
I have found [insertion]in many trials[/insertion] is actually the case contrary to the assertion of M
Grotthuss - Oxygene and hydrogene in the proportions to form
water will not explode by the electrical spark when rarefied
[deletion]20[/deletion] 18 times but hydrogene and chlorine in the proportions to form
Muriatic acid gas gave a distinct flash of light under the same
circumstances and they combined [deletion]when the[/deletion] with visible inflam-
nation when [insertion]the spark was passed through them [deletion]xxxx [/deletion][/insertion][deletion]as to[/deletion] [insertion]being[/insertion] 1/24.
The experiment on the flame of hydrogene with
the wire of platinum [insertion]& which holds good with [deletion]all the other[/deletion] flames of the other gases[/insertion] shews that by preserving heat in rarefied
air or giving heat to a mixture inflammation may be continued
when under common circumstances it would be extinguished . This
I found was the case in [deletion]many[/deletion] other instances [insertion]when the heat was differently communicated[/insertion] thus when cam-
phor was burned in a glass tube so as to make the upper
part of the tube red hot the inflammation contained when
the vacuum was 1/9 whereas it would only continue to 1/6 when
it was burned in a thick metallic tube which could not
be considerably heated by it.
By bringing a little Naphtha in contact with a red hot
iron it inflamed when there remained in the receiver only
1/30 of the original quantity of air; [insertion]though without foreign heat its flame is extinguished when the quantity is 1/6.-[/insertion]
I rarefied a mixture of oxygene and hydrogene by
the air pump [insertion]to about 18 times - when they could [/insertion] [deletion]till they could no longer[/deletion] be inflamed by the
electrical spark I then heated strongly the upper part of the
tube till the glass began to soften and then passed the spark
when a feeble flash was observed not reaching far into the
tube the heated gases only appearing to enter into inflam-
nation. [insertion]This last experiment requires [deletion]some [/deletion]considerable care. if the exhaustion is [deletion]more considerable [/deletion] much greater, it does not[/insertion]

succeed; & if the heat is [unclear]pxxxxxed[/unclear] so far
as to make the glass luminous, the flash of
light which is extremely feeble is not visible.
It is difficult to procure the [deletion]prope[/deletion] proper degree
of exhaustion & to give the exact degree of heat, I
have however succeeded three times in [insertion]obtaining[/insertion] the results
& in one instance it was witnessed by [deletion]two persons[/deletion]

- To elucidate the enquiry still further,
I made a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the heat
produced by the different gasses in combustion
[deletion]as compared with[/deletion] - In comparing the heat [deletion]given[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] communicated to the wires of platinum by
flames of the same size, it was evident
that Hydrogene & olefiant gas [insertion]in oxygene & Hydrogene on [unclear]wh [/unclear][/insertion] produced
a much greater [underline]intensity[/underline] of [insertion]heat in [/insertion]combustion than
the other gaseous substances burnt in oxygene; but
no regular [unclear]scale[/unclear] could be formed from [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion]
observations of this kind - I endeavored to
gain some approximations on the subject
by burning equal quantities of [deletion]the [/deletion]different
gasses under the same circumstances & applying
the heat to an apparatus in which it
could be measured - For the purpose
a [unclear]mercural[/unclear] gas holder was furnished with
s system of stopcocks & [deletion]a small strong[/deletion] terminating
by a strong tube of platinum [deletion]perforated[/deletion] I
having a [unclear]minute[/unclear] aperture- |_Above this was

was heated to 212[superscript]o[/superscript], to prevent any differences
in the communication of heat by condensation
of aqueous vapour:- The pressure was the
same for the different gasses & they were
consumed as nearly as possible in the same
time, & the flame applied to the same p[superscript]t[/superscript]
of the copper [deletion]tube[/deletion] cup the bottom of which
was wiped after each exp[superscript]t[/superscript].-
- The results were

It will be useful to reason upon

was deposited both from the olefiant

[insertion]impossible to doubt that the capacity of fluids for heat increases their temperature it [/insertion] [deletion]xxx[/deletion] confirms however the general
conclusions & proves that Hydrogene
[deletion]produces the greatest degree of heat[/deletion]

gaseous oxide of carbon at the bottom.
- It might at first view be imagined
that according to this scale the flame
of carbonic oxide ought to be extinguished
[insertion]by rarefaction[/insertion] before that of carburetted hydrogene; but
it must be remembered as I have
shewn in a former communication that
carbonic oxide is a much more combustible
gas; Carbonic oxide inflames in the
atmosphere when brought in contact with
an [deletion]wir[/deletion] iron wire heated to dull
redness; whereas carburetted hydrogene
is not inflammable by a similar wire
unless it is heated to whiteness so as
to burn with sparks.-

2[underline] In the effects[/underline] of [underline]rarefaction[/underline] by
[underline]heat[/underline] on [underline]combustion[/underline] & [underline]explosion[/underline]
- The results detailed in the preceding
section are directly opposed to the
opinion of M Grothuss that rarefaction
by heat destroys the [deletion]explosive power[/deletion]
[deletion]of gaseous[/deletion] combustibility of gaseous
mixtures - Before I made any direct
experiments on this subject, I endeavored
to ascertain the degree of expansion
which could be communicated to elastic
fluids by the strongest heat that
can be applied to glass vessels - For
this purpose I introduced into a [deletion]measured[/deletion]
graduated curved glass tube, some fusible
metal - I heated the fusible metal
& the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] portion of the tube containing
[deletion]that [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] air included by it under boiling

apparatus in a charcoal fire; & [insertion]very[/insertion] gradually
heated the tube till the fusible metal
& the glass appeared[insertion]luminous[deletion][unclear]xxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion][deletion]luminous[/deletion] when viewed in shade
[deletion]through an opaque tube[/deletion] - At this time
the [deletion]gas[/deletion] air had expanded so as to
occupy 2.25 [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] parts in the tube it
having been 1 at the temperature
of boiling water. Another exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was
made in a thicker glass tube & the
heat was raised till the tube began
to [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] run together; but though this
heat appeared cherry red, the expansion
was not to more than 2.5 & a
part of this [insertion][deletion]increase of volume[/deletion][/insertion]maybe perhaps [insertion]have been apparent only[/insertion] [deletion]be attributed[/deletion]
[insertion]& owing[/insertion] to the collapsing of the glass tube [insertion]before it actually melted[/insertion] - It
may be supposed that the oxidation
of the fusible metal may have had
some effect in making the expansion
appear less: but in the first exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
the air was gradually brought back
to its original temperature of boiling
water; when the absorption was scarcely
sensible - If M Gay Lussac's
[deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion][insertion]conclusions[/insertion] be taken as the ground work of
calculation & it be supposed that air
expands 1/493 for each degree of Farenheit

it would appear that the temperature of
air capable of rendering glass luminous must
be [unclear]6[/unclear] Farn[superscript]t[/superscript],-
M Grothuss describes an exp[superscript]t [/superscript]in which [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear]
[deletion]oxygene[/deletion] air & hydrogene expanded to 4 times their
bulk [insertion]over mercury[/insertion] by heat would not inflame by the
electric Spark; It is evident that [deletion]their[/deletion]
[deletion]explos[/deletion] in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] a large quantity of
Steam [insertion] or of mercurial vapour[/insertion] must have been present which
like other [insertion]inexplosive[/insertion] elastic fluids prevents [deletion]explosive[/deletion][insertion]combustion[/insertion]
when mixed in certain quantities with
explosive mixtures; but though He seems
aware that his [deletion]apparatus[/deletion][insertion]gasses[/insertion] w[deletion]as[/deletion]ere not
dry; yet He draws his general conclusion
that expansion by heat destroys the
explosive powers of gasses [insertion]principally[/insertion] from this [deletion]incorrect[/deletion][insertion]inconclusive[/insertion]
exp[superscript]t[/superscript].
I introduced into a small graduated
tube over well boiled mercury a mixture
of 2 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of Hydrogene & 1 of oxygene & heated
[deletion]them to[/deletion] the tube by a large spirit lamp
till the volume of the gas was increased
from 1 to 2.5 nearly, I then by means
of a blowpipe & a another spirit lamp
made the upper part of the tube red
hot when an explosion instantly took
place.-

several other exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] which establish the same
conclusion - A mixture of common air
& hydrogene was introduced into a
small copper tube having a stopper not
quite tight - the copper tube was placed
in a charcoal fire; before it became
visibly red an explosion took place
& the stopper was driven out.-
I made [deletion]sever[/deletion] various trials in passing
mixtures of Hydrogene & oxygene through
heated tubes - In one of these [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] trials
in which the heat was [unclear]much[/unclear] below redness
steam appeared to be formed without
any combustion - This led me to expose
mixtures of oxygene & hydrogene in
tubes in which they were [unclear]fconfined[/unclear] by
fusible metal, to heat; And I found
that [deletion]at[/deletion]by carefully applying [insertion]a[/insertion] heat
between the boiling point of mercury
which is not sufficient for the effect
& the greatest heat that can be given
without making glass luminous in darkness
the combination was effected without
any violence & without any light; &
commencing with 212[superscript]o[/superscript] the volume of steam
formed at the point of combination, appeared

[page]108|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00108|dnp10104pp|92017764[/page]
[deletion]26[/deletion] 90
exactly equal to that of the original
gasses.- So that the first effect
in exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of this kind is [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] an
explosion afterwards a contraction
& then the volume remains stationary -
- If when this change is going on the
heat is quickly raised to redness
an explosion takes place; but with
such quantities of gas it is
completed in two or three minutes.-
2[superscript]d[/superscript] - [deletion]Charcoal[/deletion] at a temperature which appeared
to be [deletion]considerably lower[/deletion] [insertion]a little above the boiling point of quicksilver it[/insertion] converted pretty
rapidly oxygene into Carbonic acid without
any luminous appearance - and at a
dull red heat, the elements of olefiant
gas [deletion]appeared[/deletion] combined in a similar
manner with oxygene, slowly & without
explosion.-
1 It is probable [superscript]1[/superscript] that this slow combination
without combustion, already [insertion]long ago[/insertion] observed with
respect to Hydrogene & chlorine [insertion]oxygene & metals[/insertion] will
happen at certain temperatures with most
[deletion]other[/deletion] substances that unite by heat - On trying
Charcoal I found that

.- The effect of the slow combination of
oxygene and hydrogene is not connected
with [deletion][unclear]any[/unclear][/deletion] their rarefaction by heat:
for I found that it took place
when the gasses were confined in a
tube by fusible metal rendered solid
at its upper surface; & [deletion]apparently [unclear]no[/unclear][/deletion]
certainly as rapidly & without any appearance
[insertion]of light. -[/insertion][deletion]luminous effect[/deletion].-
- M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Grothuss has stated that if
a [deletion]hot[/deletion][insertion]glowing[/insertion] coal be brought in contact
with a mixture of oxygene & hydrogene
it only rarefies them but does not
explode them; but this depends upon
the degree of heat communicated by
[underline]the coal[/underline], if it is red in daylight
and free from ashes it uniformly explodes
the [deletion]gass[/deletion] mixture; if its redness is barely
visible in shade it will not explode
them, but [deletion]that is[/deletion][insertion]the phaenomenon[/insertion] is wholly unconnected
with rarefaction [insertion]as[/insertion] is shewn by this
circumstance "if when the heat is

Some experiments have been lately
communicated to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh from which
it has been inferred that
water is formed during the
action of muriatic acid gas on
certain metals & consequently that
chlorine is decomposed in this
operation.
In reflecting these experiments I
have ascertained that the water
is derived from sources not
suspected by the Authors & that
their conclusions [deletion]wer[/deletion] are unfounded.
To take up the time of the
Society by long experimental details
& theoretical speculations on such

[page]118|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00118|dnp10114pp|92017775[/page]
100
an occasion will be unnecessary.
I shall therefore only transiently
mention the sources of error.
& demonstrate their operation by
two or three examples.-
When muriatic acid gas is passed
through flint glass tubes heated to
redness a small quantity of
water is formed by the action
of the gas on the oxide of
lead in the glass & a smaller
quantity by its action on
the alkali of the glass, the
process being one of double affinity
the hydrogen Of the muriatic acid
uniting to the oxygene of the
metallic oxides & the chlorine
combining with the metals.-
A copious dew was formed by
passing muriatic acid gas through
flint glass tubes red hot, & a

[page]119|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00119|dnp10115pp|92017776[/page]
101
less copious dew by passing it
through green glass tubes; In the
first instance the glass became
opaque & gained a pearly lustre
& a combination of chlorine
& lead sublimes from the hotter
into the colder part of the
tube - In the second, the surface
of the tube became slightly opaque
but no sublimate was formed.
- When [insertion]fine[/insertion] clean iron wire was introduced
into such tubes & made red hot
& muriatic acid gas passed over
it no particular precautions being
taken to free the tubes from
common air, much more water
appeared, but this excess of
water principally owed its
existence to the combination
of hydrogene disengaged from
the muriatic acid gas by
the iron with the oxygene

[page]120|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00120|dnp10116pp|92017777[/page]
102
of the common air, I say principally
because a[insertion]n[/insertion] [deletion]minute [/deletion][insertion]inappreciable[/insertion] quantity [deletion]was [/deletion]most
[insertion][deletion]probably[/deletion] have been[/insertion] likewise deposited from the [deletion]vapour[/deletion]
[deletion]of hydrate of[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]vapour[/deletion] vapour of the hydrated muriatic acid in [/insertion] Muriatic acid gas.
- This was proved by filling the
whole apparatus with hydrogene
in another experiment & generating
the muriatic acid gas in a
retort filled with Hydrogene, when
the water [insertion]produced[/insertion] [deletion]formed[/deletion] was no
more than might have been
expected from the action of
the muriatic acid gas on
the oxide of lead & alkali
in the glass, I give the
details above 21 grains of
the first combination of chlorine
& iron were formed, the quantity
of moisture collected by bibulous
paper & which was a strong
acid solution of the protomuriate
of iron amounted to less than

[page]121|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00121|dnp10117pp|92017778[/page]
103
half a grain, & of this [deletion]less than[/deletion] [insertion]not more than[/insertion]
two thirds could have been water
- Now if chlorine had been
decomposed in this operation, the
quantity of water ought to have
[deletion]amounted to between three &[insertion]near[/insertion] four[/deletion] [deletion]been at least[/deletion]
[deletion]grains[/deletion] - been at least ten
times as great -
I have shown by [unclear]numerous[/unclear] experiments
that in the action of muriatic acid
gas upon metals hydrogen equal
in volume to half the volume
of the gas is produced, it is
therefore evident that if water
had been produced in the action
of muriatic acid gas on metals
it must have been the chlorine
or the metal or both that
were decomposed - As chlorine
can be freed from aqueous
vapour by [insertion]dry[/insertion] muriate of lime
[deletion]it appears[/deletion] which is not the case

[page]122|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00122|dnp10118pp|92017779[/page]
104
with muriatic acid gas it offers
a much more unexceptionable
substance for experiments of
this kind, I passed 23 cubical
inches of Chlorine slowly through
dry muriate of lime into a flint
glass tube red hot containing
[deletion]iron wire contained in[/deletion] a green
glass tube full of iron wire
the chlorine combined with
this iron wire with intense
heat, the bright sublimate
formed was passed through more
iron wire heated to redness
so as to form a considerable
quantity of the first compound
of chlorine with iron which when
examined was found exactly
the same as that produced
by the action of the muriatic
acid gas on iron - All
the products were heated [insertion]strongly[/insertion] & the

[page]123|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00123|dnp10119pp|92017780[/page]
105
end of the glass tube kept very
cool, [underline]but not the slightest[/underline]
[underline]appearance of moisture was[/underline]
perceptible.-
In all these experiments I
was assisted by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Faraday
of the Royal Institution -
- Muriate of Ammonia is not
altered by being passed through
porcelain or glass tubes heated
to redness; but if metals be
present it [deletion]presents [insertion]much[/insertion] the same[/deletion]
offers similar results to muriate
acid gas; [deletion]I have often made[/deletion] [insertion]in one experiment[/insertion]
[deletion]experiments on the action of[/deletion] [insertion]in which muriate of Ammonia recently[/insertion]
[deletion]Potassium on muriate of Ammonia[/deletion] [insertion]sublimed was used instead of muriatic[/insertion]
[deletion]& can positively affirm that[/deletion] [insertion]acid gas , the [deletion]quantity of water which[/deletion] [unclear]appearance[/unclear][/insertion]
[deletion]no water appears in this[/deletion] [insertion]of moisture was less [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion][unclear]xxxxx  xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] than in the experiments[/insertion]
[insertion]which have been just detailed & yet there[/insertion] operation .
was a considerable action on the [deletion]action[/deletion]
oxide of lead of the glass not only

[page]124|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00124|dnp10120pp|92017781[/page]
106
by the Muriatic acid: but likewise by the free hydrogene
of the decomposed ammonia.-
In closing this [deletion]note[/deletion][insertion]paper[/insertion] on the
fallacy of the [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear] [/deletion]experiments
in the pretended decomposition
of Chlorine, I can hardly avoid
noticing a paper in the
last volume of the [unclear]memores[/unclear]
[deletion]of[/deletion]D'Arcueil[insertion]by M. Berthollet[/insertion] which contains
some [insertion]slight[/insertion] mistakes as to the
progress of my views on the
Theory of Chlorine, I know
so well the candour &
liberality of this excellent
philosopher that I am sure
He will be pleased rather
than offended by [deletion]my [unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]
a correction of them.-
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollet quotes my Brother
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Davy as the Author of
the experiment which proved that

[page]125|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00125|dnp10121pp|92017782[/page]
107.
no water was formed by the action
of [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] chlorine on Ammonia, which
is not the case He was the
discoverer of a fact of much
more importance in the chemical
History of Chlorine namely the
combination of Chlorine with
carbonic oxide .-
If M Berthollet had referred to
the paper in which I first communicated
[deletion]my[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] theory of the simple nature of
Chlorine to the Royal Society July
12 1810 - He would have found
that my chief arguments are 1[superscript]st[/superscript]

might with that [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]consideration[/insertion] which
its importance demanded.
When I first turned my attention particularly

[deletion][unclear]xx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] in consequence of a

In Flanders an [unclear]adit[/unclear] [insertion]or Fungus tinder[/insertion] [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]had been occasionally[/insertion] employed
in dangerous parts of the mine; but
the light yielded by this substance
was much too small to [insertion]be used for[/insertion] working the mines
& only serves to enable the miners
to find their way for particular
 occasions.
M de Berthollet [insertion]the rightly celebrated philosophical traveller in 1798[/insertion] conceived & secured
the plan of a lamp for giving
light [insertion]in mines[/insertion] where a common candle
would not burn or produce
explosion; but it was formed
upon the principle of entire
insulation from the air & could
burn only for a short time
till the air contained in it
was exhausted; - A lamp upon
a plan similar as to insulation
was contrived by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny in 1813
but He [unclear][insertion]xxxxxxxxx[/insertion][/unclear] supplied his light
13
with air from the mine through
water by means of a bellows &
it went out in explosive atmospheres
& to be employed required [deletion]manual labour[/deletion] [insertion]to be worked by hand[/insertion]

The great object are rather to be
ardently desired than [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] reasonably expected
was to find a light which at
the same time that it enabled the
miners to work with security in
explosive atmospheres shall likewise
consume the firedamp; Having learnt
from M[superscript]r[/superscript] Baddle the degree of light
required for the common operations
of the workmen, I made several
experiments with the hope of obtaining
such a light, without active inflammation
I tried Kunckels Lantern & Baldwins
Phosphorus & likewise the electrical
light in close vessels but without
success - I had [insertion]a[/insertion]lamp[deletion]s[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]&made with[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]made with[/deletion]

It will be unnecessary to dwell further upon
preliminary & unsuccessful attempts; &
I shall proceed to describe the
origin & progress of those
investigations which led me
to the [deletion]present[/deletion] discovery of the
principles by which explosion & flame
 may be arrested or regulated & by means
[deletion]reason[/deletion] of which the miner is
not only able to subdue &
control but likewise to render useful
his most dangerous enemy. -
- I first began by a minute chemical
examinations of the substances with which
I had to contend; The analysis of
various specimens [insertion]of firedamp[/insertion] shewed no heat the
[unclear]xxx[/unclear] inflammable part of [deletion]fire damp[/deletion] it
was light carburetted Hydrogene as
[deletion]had stated[/deletion] D[superscript]r[/superscript] Henry had before stated
Hydrogene or pure inflammable air combined
with charcoal or carbon[deletion]& heat it[/deletion]
I made [deletion]various[/deletion] [insertion]numerous[/insertion] experiments on this
[deletion]degree of its inflammability & the[/deletion] circumstances
 under which it explodes & the degree of
its inflammability, -
- I found that it required to be mixed
with very large quantities of [deletion]inflam[/deletion] atmospheric
air to produce explosion [deletion]1 part of it[/deletion]

[deletion]will[/deletion] will when mixed with 3 or [insertion]nearly[/insertion] four
times its volume of air, it burnt
quietly in the atmosphere & extinguished a
taper [deletion]without explosion[/deletion]- when mixed
with between 5 & six times its
volume of air it exploded feebly -
it exploded with most energy when
mixed with seven or eight times its
volume of air; & mixtures of firedamp
& air retained their explosive powers
[deletion]though diminishing in for though finally[/deletion]
when their proportions were one of gas
to 13 of air - When the air was
in larger quantity the flame of a taper
was merely enlarged in the mixture
 an effect which was still perceived
in [deletion]mixtures of[/deletion] 30 parts of air to
one of gas - [deletion][insertion]I mentioned that[/insertion] in all cases[/deletion]
[deletion]found that carbonic acid was formed[/deletion]

than other inflammable gasses. It was

 the heat produced by it in combustion

metallic tubes prevented explosion better

137
occurred to me, [deletion]that[/deletion]as a [underline]considerable[/underline] heat
was required for the inflammation of the
firedamp & [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] as it produced in burning
comparatively a [underline]small degree[/underline] of heat, that
the effect of carbonic acid & azote & of
the [deletion]metallic[/deletion] surfaces of small tubes has
prevented its explosion depended upon
 their cooling powers, upon their lowering
the temperature of the exploding mixture
so much that it was no longer
sufficient for its continuous inflammation.
- This idea which was confirmed by various
obvious considerations [deletion]immediately[/deletion] led [deletion]me[/deletion]
to an immediate [insertion]result[/insertion] [deletion]application[/deletion] "the possibility
of constructing a lamp in which the cooling
powers of the Azote [insertion]or carbonic acid formed by combustion[/insertion] [deletion]should prevent the[/deletion]
[deletion]possibility of explosion[/deletion], or [deletion]in which[/deletion] the
cooling powers of the apertures through which
the air [deletion]was[/deletion] entered or made its exit
should prevent the communication of explosions
- I first tried the effects of lamps in
which there was a very limited circulation
19
of air [deletion][insertion]though[/insertion] in explosive mixtures[/deletion] & [insertion]I found[/insertion] that
when a taper [insertion]in a close location[/insertion] was supplied with [deletion]its[/deletion] air so
[insertion]as to burn feebly from[/insertion] [deletion]using limited quantity of air from[/deletion] [insertion]any[/insertion] small

it could give only a full light & immediately
adopted systems of tubes above & below,

in lamps of this construction was
important as the [deletion]gradual[/deletion] increase of

I tried various forms of lamps in which
wire gauze was used for air feeders
& chimneys & in which attempts were
made to burn explosive mixtures
at certain surfaces within the lamp till
& after [insertion][deletion]trying[/deletion][/insertion] complicated combinations I at length
[deletion]at last adopted[/deletion] [insertion]arrived[/insertion] [deletion]the most simple[/deletion]

146
at once to see that by increasing the
cooling surface in the top or in
any other part of the lamp, the
heat acquired by it might be
diminished to any extent & I
immediately made a number of
experiments to perfect this [underline]invention[/underline]
which was evidently the one
to be adopted as it excluded
the necessity of using glass or
any fusible or brittle substance
in the Lamp; & not only deprived
the firedamp of its explosive
powers; but rendered it a useful
light. -
-[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Though [insertion]all[/insertion] the specimens of firedamp
which I had examined consisted of
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] carburetted hydrogene mixed with
different [insertion]small[/insertion] proportions of carbonic acid
26
& common air yet some phenomena
that I observed in the combustion of
a blower induced me to believe
that [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] small quantities of olefiant
gas [deletion]or hydrogene[/deletion] may be sometimes evolved

[deletion]from[/deletion] in coal [insertion]mines[/insertion] with the carburetted Hydrogene
- I therefore resolved to make all
lamps safe to the test of the
gas produced by the distillate
of coal which when [deletion]not much[/deletion]
it has not been exposed to
water always containing olefiant
gas - I placed my lighted lamps
in [deletion]a gl[/deletion] a large glass receiver through
which there was a current of
atmospherical air & by means of
a [deletion]large[/deletion] Gasometer filled with
coal gas. I made the current
of air which passed into the
lamp more or less explosive & caused

slowly at pleasure so as to produce
all possible varieties of inflammable

consequently adopted this material
in guarding lamps for the coal
mines where in [insertion]January 1816 in[/insertion] consequence of
the [deletion]perfectly &[/deletion] example & enlightened
exertions of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Baddle they were

been in general use -
- [deletion]In making [insertion]some[/insertion][/deletion] Observations upon them

of combustion led me [insertion]in Dec[superscript]r[/superscript]1816[/insertion] to an
important practical addition
produced entirely upon a new
principle. -
The wire gauze lamp [insertion]in its common form[/insertion] burns in
all atmospheres that are explosive
& by [deletion]a[/deletion] suspending or placing in
it a little cage of wire of platinum
[insertion]or palladium[/insertion] of from 1/60 to y[superscript]e[/superscript] 1/100 of an inch
in thickness, it yields a light in
atmospheres too much contaminated
with fire damp to be explosive a
slow combustion being [deletion]produced[/deletion] [insertion]occasioned[/insertion]

- I shall conclude this [deletion]general[/deletion] view
by some general observations on
flame & combustion which will [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
shew more distinctly the causes &
the limits of [deletion]security[/deletion] [insertion]safety[/insertion] in lamps
& which will [deletion]shew[/deletion] [insertion]demonstrate[/insertion] the danger of
combinations made with an
imperfect knowledge of the principles
of security. -
- Flame may be defined to be aeriform
or gaseous matter heated to such a
degree as to be luminous; & it may
 be produced independent of any chemical
changes as is shewn in the discharge
of voltaic electricity through an undecomposable
gas - very concentrated electricity in passing
through bodies constantly heats them whether
they be solid fluid or gaseous & by
 the voltaic apparatus the nature of
flame is distinctly shewn, [deletion]it is air[/deletion]
30
[deletion]intensely heated[/deletion]. Flames are conical
because the greatest heat is in the
centre of the mass & because heated
air rapidly ascends through cooler
air - Whenever [underline]flame[/underline] is produced
in chemical combination gaseous matter

[page]171|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00171|dnp10167pp|92017828[/page]
151
is the cause of it & the heat of flames
seems [insertion]always[/insertion] proportional; [insertion]other circumstances remaining the same[/insertion] to the capacity of
combination & to the density of the
gases combining then the heat of flames
[deletion]by[/deletion] diminishes by rarefaction & increases
by condensation - Whenever combustible gaseous
matter burns in the atmosphere it must
first mix with a certain quantity of air
if it requires a high temperature
for its combustion it will be easily
extinguished by rarefaction, or by
cooling agencies, whether of solid
surfaces or mixtures of incombustible
gasses, if it requires a very low
temperature for its combustion it
will burn in highly rarefied air
or under considerable cooling agencies.
 By heating strongly gasses that burn
with difficulty their [insertion]continued[/insertion] inflammation
becomes easy [deletion]by [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]in consequence of[/insertion] increments
of heat produced by combustion [deletion]of[/deletion]
[deletion]In[/deletion] of small quantities [deletion]of them[/deletion]
which under any other circumstances
31
would not produce continued combustion
- Hence if mixtures of firedamp [deletion]were[/deletion] are
burnt from systems of tubes or canals
[insertion]or metallic plates[/insertion] which have small radiating surfaces
though these systems are safe at first

[page]172|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00172|dnp10168pp|92017829[/page]
152
they become dangerous as they are heated *
- Where currents are occasioned which
concentrate explosive mixtures by the
air feeders [insertion]in lamps[/insertion] being below*, [deletion]there being[/deletion]
[deletion]an increment of heat, - with[/deletion]
& made in thick metallic plates
or canals there bring an increment
of heat within & a very small
radiating surface only without, as
the heat increases the [deletion]explosive[/deletion]
combustion of the explosive mixtures
will gradually extend further &
at last communicate with the
external air for explosion will
be communicated by any aperture
however small provided it be
sufficiently heated. - This circumstance
is shewn in a very elegant manner
in burning concentrated mixtures of
oxygene & hydrogene at the end of
a long tube of 1/60 or 1/70 of an
inch in diameter. When the experiment
begins the tube being cool here
32
is no danger, gradually however as
it becomes heated the combustion steals
as it were down the tube & at
last reaches the reservoir of the gasses

Where one set of air feeders only are
attempted in a lamp they should present
an uniform [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] surface, [deletion]where[/deletion] [insertion]so that[/insertion] the radiating
 power of the metal [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] may[/insertion] immediately ballance

be so massy as to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

means [deletion]of[/deletion] for a gradual accumulation
of heat. - Wire gauze as it [insertion]offers[/insertion] [deletion]produces[/deletion]
a greater extent of radiating surface
[insertion]than perforated metallic plates[/insertion] is [deletion]by far[/deletion] the best material for the guard
of lamps & by being made of the proper
degree of fineness, [deletion]& by being [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] it
will [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] form a barrier for every
species of explosion requiring temperatures
higher than those of our atmosphere;
but the apertures must be smaller
& the radiating surfaces greater in
proportion to the inflammability
of the gas; - And currents of concentrated
33
called the Killingworth safety lamp & another
called the steam safety lamp for these reasons & I
 [insertion]might add many others.[/insertion] My principle of security is attempted to
be pirated in these lamps, but through the
ignorance of the contractors it does not [insertion][underline]really[/underline][/insertion] exist.

explosive mixtures acting even for any
length of time may be [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] stopped

- Wire gauze for lamps must not be
made of [insertion]or covered with[/insertion], [deletion]of[/deletion] any easily combustible
metal. Thus brass wire is improper
& the iron wire should not be
 tinned, the Body of the lamp
should be of copper riveted together
 or of massy cast brass or
cast iron, the screws should fit
tight, no aperture [underline]however small[/underline]
should be suffered to exist
in the body of the lamps, [deletion]the[/deletion]&
the trimming wire should have through
a long tight tube. -
 - Flame whether produced by the
combustion of large or small quantities
of explosive mixtures may be always
extinguished or destroyed by certain
cooling agencies & in proportion
to the heat required to
carry on the combustion
so in proportion is it
more easily destroyed; the temperature

is far below that of flame; & hence
red hot gauze [deletion]is like[/deletion] in certain
quantities will absorb sufficient
heat from the flame of carburetted
hydrogene or firedamp to
extinguish it. -
- Combinations of gasses may be
produced by a heat not sufficient
to raise their temperature into
flame; but they still produce
heat during their combustion
[deletion]which[/deletion] as is evident from what
has been stated safe & when
in a [deletion]combust[/deletion] mixture

gasses the cooling agencies
are too great to permit
the appearance of flame or

New Exp[superscript][underline]ts[/underline][/superscript] on [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]some of the[/insertion] Combinations of Phosphorus
[underline]by Sir H Davy LLD FRS Vice Pres : RI -[/underline]
In a paper published in the Transactions
of the Royal Society [insertion]for 1812[/insertion] I have detailed
a number of experiments on Phosphorus
from which I deduced the composition
of some of its compounds with
oxygene with Hydrogene & with
chlorine. - Since the appearance
of this paper various [insertion]researches[/insertion][deletion]trasactions[/deletion]
have been brought forward on
the same subject, in which
some results differing very much
from each other & from mine
are stated. I ventured to conclude
that the Phosphoric acid contained

[page]186|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00186|dnp10182pp|92017843[/page]
166
double the quantity of oxygene to that
in the Phosphorous acid &
that [deletion]oxygene being [unclear]xxxxxented[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]by 15 the number representing[/deletion]
[deletion]Phosphorus was about 20[/deletion]
Phosphoric acid contains [deletion][unclear]xxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] about
3/5 of its weight of oxygene. -
 - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berzelius considers the [deletion]phosphorus[/deletion]
oxygene in Phosphoric acid to
be 128.17 [insertion][deletion]1000[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]the Phosphorus being[/deletion]
[deletion]100[/deletion] & Mr Dulong 124.5 The [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
Phosphorus being 100. [deletion]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Thomas[/deletion]
[deletion]Thompson who has [insertion]allowed[/insertion] [unclear]xxxxxx xxxxxxx[/unclear] [insertion]very different[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]proportions at different times[/deletion]
[deletion]namely 160 & 121 has lately[/deletion]
[deletion]raised the quantity of oxygene[/deletion]
[deletion]to 200.-[/deletion] M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dulong & M[superscript]r [/superscript]Berzelius

167
suppose the quantity of oxygene in
Phosphoric acid to be [insertion]to[/insertion] that in Phosphorous
acid as 3 to 5. -
The nature which immediately induced
me to resume the enquiry respecting the
Phosphoric combinations was M.
Dulong's paper. This ingenious
chemist has not only endeavoured
to establish new proportions in
3
[deletion]supporting[/deletion] the known [deletion]combinations[/deletion]
compounds of Phosphorus; but
has likewise attempted to prove
 the existence of two new acids
of phosphorus & has denied several
facts which I considered as
sufficiently established.

The confidence with which M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dulong
[insertion]has[/insertion] announced his [insertion]own conclusions & the[/insertion] [deletion]results & the[/deletion]
[deletion]apparent accuracy & minuteness of[/deletion] [insertion]decided tone in which he speaks or error[/insertion]
into which he supposes I had fallen
[deletion]His details[/deletion] induced me to make
new investigations with the hope
of discovering the cause of [deletion]these errors[/deletion] [insertion]my mistakes[/insertion]
[insertion][deletion]for[/deletion] I had no idea that I should[/insertion] [deletion]discordance of our [insertion]conclusions[/insertion] results & the[/deletion]
[deletion]however of the errors into which[/deletion] [insertion]have found so little to offer in the general[/insertion]
[deletion]he supposes I had fallen[/deletion] [insertion]notion of my views as will appear to be the[/insertion]
case from the details on the following pages.
- I was certain from the various
experiments made both long ago & recently
& [insertion]the results of which[/insertion]had been confirmed by [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Brande that the proportion of
oxygene which M. Dulong assigns to
Phosphoric acid is [deletion]much[/deletion] [insertion]considerably[/insertion] smaller
than that denoted by [deletion]the result[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] the combustion of small quantities
of Phosphorus in oxygene gas. -

I know that [deletion]small[/deletion] [insertion]minute proportions[/insertion] [deletion]quantities[/deletion] of
phosphuretted Hydrogene were separated
from Phosphorus by Voltaic Electricity
it occurred to me as possible
that water might be formed
in the combustion of Phosphorus
& separated from the phosphoric
acid when it entered into
5
saline or metallic combinations.
To ascertain if this were the
case I passed Phosphorus [insertion]to saturation[/insertion] through
red hot lime in a green glass
tube connected with a mercurio
pneumatic apparatus the combustion
took place with vivid ignition
but [deletion]not[/deletion] no [deletion]of[/deletion] elastic fluid was produced.

[page]190|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00190|dnp10186pp|92017847[/page]
- [deletion]I[/deletion] A portion of the phosphuret
of lime formed was introduced
 into a [deletion]p[/deletion] tray of platinum
& heated in a glass retort
filled with oxygene gas - The Phosphuret
of lime burnt brilliantly & became
partly converted into [underline]phosphate[/underline]
[underline]of lime[/underline]: - but on restoring
the original temperature of
the retort there was no
appearance of [underline]vapour[/underline] or
of moisture. -
Having [deletion]I[/deletion] examined the Phosphate
of lime formed in this operation

171
& satisfied myself that it was
the same as that formed by
other [deletion]ways[/deletion] methods, it [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]became[/insertion]
evident that there were no sources
of error in experiments or
the combustion of Phosphorus
in oxygene gas arising from
the formation or separation of
7
water & the only circumstance
which could be urged against
the accuracy of [insertion]processes[/insertion] [deletion]my former exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion]
on this combustion was the
small quantity of the materials
on which they had been made.
- The vividness & rapidity of the
combustion of Phosphorus renders it

impossible to burn considerable quantities
of Phosphorus in the common way
 in glass vessels. - Phosphuret of
lime burns much more slowly
& less intensely. I endeavoured to
ascertain the quantity of oxygene
absorbed by a given weight
of Phosphorus converted into
Phosphuret of lime; but the
experiment did not succeed;
 though the phosphuret of lime
was in fine powder & distributed
over a large surface; yet the
phosphate of lime which formed
[deletion]fixed[/deletion] [insertion]& fixed[/insertion] on the exterior defended
the interior of the phosphuret
from the action of the oxygene

& prevented its combustion.
- After various unsuccessful trials
to [deletion]con[/deletion] [insertion]convert[/insertion] considerable quantities of
Phosphorus into [deletion]oxygene[/deletion] phosphoric acid
by [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] combinations containing
oxygene. I at last thought of
a very simple mode of burning
Phosphorus which answered perfectly.
9
- Phosphorus requires a considerable
heat for its volatalization - by
boiling it in a small tube
so [insertion]constructed[/insertion] that the Phosphorus
can burn in vapour only
from the aperture of the tube
large quantities of to may be
burnt [insertion]by the heat of a spirit lamp[/insertion] in a [insertion]retort[/insertion] [deletion]vessel [/deletion]filled with

[page]194|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00194|dnp10190pp|92017851[/page]
174
oxygene & the absorption of
oxygene & the quantity of
Phosphoric acid formed accurately
ascertained.
The opposite sketch
will give an idea
of the apparatus
the neck of the little
[insertion]curved[/insertion] [deletion]curved[/deletion] tube or small
distilling retort [deletion]is left[/deletion]
after the Phosphorus
is introduced is drawn
out & an aperture
left of about 1/10
of an inch it
should not be

formed; - by regulating the heat
or raising or lowering the spirit
lamp the [deletion]vapour of the[/deletion]
[deletion]Phosphorus[/deletion] combustion may be
carried on slowly or rapidly
at pleasure. -
11
- Operating in this way I
 have often burnt from 5 to
10 grains of Phosphorus without
any [deletion]single[/deletion] accident & ascertained
exactly the quantity of oxygene
absorbed; there is only one
source of error: [deletion]& such an[/deletion]
[deletion]insigificant one[/deletion], a [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] quantity

of[deletion][unclear]xxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] Phosporous remains
in the [deletion]little[/deletion] [insertion]upper part of the[/insertion] tube which
cannot be burnt except by
a greater heat than the
retort will bear; & it is
difficult to ascertain the
precise weight of this as
the [deletion]little glass[/deletion] tube always
 unites with some phosphoric
acid where it is red
hot at its mouth; but
this [deletion]as will be evident[/deletion]
[deletion]from[insertion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion][unclear]xxxx xxx[/unclear] details[/deletion] can be

- Phosphoric acid will be composed

According to the second of 100
[deletion]Phosphorus[/deletion] to 139 [deletion]of oxygene[/deletion]
and according to the third of 100
to 131.2. - The mean will
be 100 to 135. [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]In the third experiment the combustion[/deletion]
[deletion]was slower than in the other two.[/deletion]
The light of the Phosphorus
burning in vapour in these experiments
was exceptionally bright, yet the top
of the retort never became softened
& the phosphoric acid which increased
the weight of the tube principally combined
with the glass at the aperture where it was red hot
I cannot but consider the process of burning Phosphorus
in the gaseous state in a great excess of oxygene as the most
 accurate mode that has yet been devised for ascertaining
the composition of Phosphoric acid. In this instance

no phosphoric acid [insertion]as I ascertained by [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] direct trials[/insertion] is formed from

concerned except those that
actually combine. - M Dulong's
method of ascertaining the composition
of Phosphoric acid appears to me
much too complicated to afford any
[deletion]accurate[/deletion] results approaching to
17
accuracy. - He first combines
copper wire with Phosphorus by
passing [insertion]Phosphorus[/insertion] over it by means of
a stream of hydrogene gas.
He then dissolves this phosphate
of copper in Nitric acid
& determines the quantity of

which processes sources of
error may exist.

to establish respecting chlorine in

In experiments that I formerly made
on this subject by admitting

the absorption by introducing
solution of chlorine, I [deletion]considerably[/deletion]
[unclear]overated[/unclear] the [deletion]ga[/deletion] absorption I did
not at that time know what
I have since ascertained that
a solution of chlorine in water

under all circumstances it is difficult
to gain very precise results
in exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the action of
Phosphorus on chlorine. - Mercury acts
so rapidly [deletion]acts[/deletion] upon chlorine
that it cannot be employed [insertion]for exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]in which the absorption is to be determined[/insertion]
When [insertion]common[/insertion] water is used some
21
of the gas is absorbed by
the water & the sublimate

& its vapour always increases

 there was a loss of 7/10 of a

When chlorine [deletion]not freed from moisture[/deletion]

but when [deletion]chlorine dried by [insertion]dry[/insertion] muriate[/deletion]
[deletion]of lime is employed[/deletion][insertion]the mercury has been recently boiled[/insertion] no effect of

[deletion]myself[/deletion] [insertion]more water is converted into muriatic & phosphoric acids as I proposed[/insertion] by some very delicate experiments,
 [deletion]made ever mercury[/deletion], so that there
27
is certainly no hydrogene denoted

After reflecting much upon
the methods of combining chlorine

in operating [deletion]in the way[/deletion] over

so that the [insertion]apparent[/insertion] absorption must

In examining minutely the circumstances
of the action of the liquid chloride

 - He speaks of acting upon dry Phosphorus

We owe to the ingenuity of

half as much oxygene as the

- Assuming the composition of

 is stated in the preceding page which
agrees very nearly with [deletion]my[/deletion] [insertion]an[/insertion] experiment
which I formerly made [deletion]in its specific[/deletion]

than that which has been just calculated
upon; but it must be remembered
that a certain quantity of common
phosphuretted hydrogene is produced [deletion]towards[/deletion]
[deletion]the beginning & end of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/deletion] which
containing less hydrogene in a given volume
would sufficiently explain the difference
of result.
- M Dulong has advanced an ingenious
opinion that the hypophosphorous
51
acid [underline]may be considered[/underline] as a
 triple compound of hydrogene, oxygene
& phosphorus. - There is another view
which may be taken of its composition
namely that it [insertion]may be[/insertion] a compound
of Phosphoric acid & perphosphuretted
hydrogene - phosphuretted hydrogene as
may be deduced from some experiments
of M. Dulong has the proportions of a

[page]236|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00236|dnp10232pp|92017894[/page]
216
 very weak alkali; & when expelled
from the neutral hypophosphite they
become acid - This view
agrees very much with the equivalent
or proportional number which represent
Phosphoric acid & hypophosphuretted
hydrogene. If it be adopted
the hypophosphites must be
considered as triple compound
analogous to the salts containing fixed
alkali & earths or ammonia &
earths combined with acids. -

M Dulong supposes that the acid formed

acids is a [insertion]peculiar[/insertion] [deletion]new[/deletion] acid a [insertion]chemical[/insertion] compound
of Phosphorous and Phosphoric acids [insertion]which he names Phosphatic acid[/insertion] I
I cannot say that his arguments
53
gave much probability to this opinion
 This substance has no chrystaline
 form nor marked characters which
distinguish it from a pure mixture
of Phosphorous & phosphoric acids; &
as far as my exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] have gone it
is far from uniform but its [insertion]composition[/insertion] [deletion]proportions[/deletion] &
Phosphorus & Phosphoric acid mixed

That a mixture of Phosphorous & Phosphoric

218
acids should be produced by the
slow combustion of Phosphorus is
not surprising when it is considered
that this phenomenon is connected
with two different chemical processes
[deletion]- The heat is produced by the burning[/deletion]
[deletion]of the [insertion]combustion of[/insertion] vapour of phosphorus[/deletion] in
[deletion]a great excess of air which probably[/deletion]

- I have mentioned in the
paper to which I have referred in
the beginning of this communication
that the Hydrophosphorous acid is
decomposed by heat [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] & that
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Phosphoric acid & [insertion]per[/insertion] phospuretted
hydrogene are the results.

In examining the nature of the
phosphoric acid formed I find that
it contains water ie that it
is a hydrated phosphoric acid
in carefully conducting the experiment
I find likewise that a small
proportion of water is given off
with the [deletion]bi[/deletion][insertion]per[/insertion]phosphurtted gas. I
shall give the results of an
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] 17.5 grains of Hydrophosphorous

can be expected. [deletion]for a little of the hydrophosphuratted[/deletion]

results supposing a hydrophosphorus

I have taken the number [insertion]represents[/insertion][deletion]of[/deletion] oxygene as
15; which is extremely convenient as
the multiples are simple 30, 45, 60 &c
- Taking the proportion of [deletion]my[/deletion] Phosphoric acid

I shall conclude this paper by a few
incidental observations on the compounds
of Phosphorus.
M. Dulong states that no Phosphorous
acid is formed when Phosphorus is
 burnt in excess of oxygene & atmospheric
air as he says I have asserted.
- I cannot find that I have any where
made such an assertion: but notwithstanding
what M. Dulong pretends this assertion
is true as the following experiment will
prove, a a half a grain of Phosphorus
was set fire to in a retort
 containing sixteen cubical inches of common
 air - the acid products washed with
distilled water [insertion]& passed through a filter &[/insertion] [deletion]for which was[/deletion] evaporated
when the acid became nearly dry, small
globules of phosphuretted hydrogene were disengaged
 from it indicating the presence of phosphorous
acid - The exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated two or
three times & care being taken to
separate [insertion]the red powder[/insertion] [deletion]using red oxide of phosph of[/deletion]
[deletion]the substance which he[/deletion] which has
been considered as an oxide of Phosphorus
& always with the same result

[page]245|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00245|dnp10241pp|92017903[/page]
225
Whenever Phosphorus is inflamed& suffered
to burn out in oxygene gas in excess
unless the product is strongly heated
after the spontaneous combustion is
over [deletion]phosphorus[/deletion] an acid [deletion]of[/deletion] of which
the hydrate produces Phosphurated hydrogene
by heat is always found in the products
& this acid is probably produced by
the action of the solid phosphorus on the
Phosphoric acid in contact with it. - This fact
& the circumstance that much Phosphorous acid
61
acid is produced by the combustion
of Phosphorus in [unclear]pure[/unclear] air renders
it [insertion]almost certain[/insertion] [deletion]probable[/deletion] the the Phosphorous
 acid is a direct combination
of Phosphorus & oxygene & destroys
our idea which might otherwise
be formed from the [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] of
the decomposition of its hydrate, namely
that it is composed of three proportions
of Phosphoric acid & one of phosphurated
hydrogene.
- M Dulong & M Berzelius speak of
freeing Phosphorus or the liquid
Chloride of Phosphorus from Phosphorus
 by distillation - in exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] [insertion]which I have made[/insertion] in which

[page]246|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00246|dnp10242pp|92017904[/page]
226
It has been twice carefully distiled at
a low heat it has still contained
[deletion]quanti[/deletion] minute quantities of Phosphorus
- [deletion]Then[/deletion] [insertion]It has been[/insertion] supposed that dry Phosphoric
acid is [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] fixed at a white heat
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]; but I find that this is not
the case, It [insertion]rapidly[/insertion] rises in vapour at this
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] temperature [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] & [insertion]evaporates[/insertion] even at the
point of fusion of flint glass; &
the hydrat of Phosphoric acid [deletion]slowly[/deletion]
[deletion]but rises to[insertion]evaporates[/insertion] vapour at a dull red[/deletion]
[deletion]heat; & boils at red heat[/deletion]
[deletion]is still not capable[/deletion] susceptible of
being volatiled at a much lower
temperature.
[deletion]I shall not present exercise[/deletion]
[deletion]In converting the solid sublimate[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] composed of Phosphorus & chlorine[/deletion]
[deletion]into the liquid compound by Phosphorus[/deletion]
[deletion]when the Phosphorus is first fixed[/deletion]
[deletion]will contact with the sublimate a[/deletion]
[deletion]whi[/deletion] yellow crystaline mass is formed
which [deletion]is reached by [unclear]xx[/unclear] a[/deletion][insertion]when acted on by[/insertion] higher
degree of heat [deletion]into Phosphorus[/deletion]
affords the liquid chloride which rises from
it in vapour & leaves Phosphorus behind
- It is possible that this yellow solid is a
compound of Phosphorus & chlorine containing
half as much chlorine as the liquid; should this
be proved to be the case by future experiments, it will
give weight to the idea that hypophosphorous acid is [deletion]composed of[/deletion]
a [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] compound of oxygen & phosphorus

Having witnessed one of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Sicklers
 attempts to unfold the Herculaneum
manuscripts it occurred to me
that a chemical examination of
the nature of the manuscripts & of
the changes they had undergone might
offer some data as to the best
methods to be attempted for unrolling
them - On mentioning this to Sir
Thomas Tyrwhitt he obligingly put
into my hands [deletion]the[insertion]some[/insertion][/deletion] fragments of
[deletion]a[/deletion] MS [deletion]of[/deletion] which ( the principal
parts being destroyed ) were proper
1
to be sacrificed to experiments -
I consequently began a chemical
investigation of the subject; &

[page]256|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00256|dnp10252pp|92017914[/page]
235
in the course of my experiments
ascertained [insertion]several[/insertion] [deletion]some[/deletion] facts which throw
considerable light on this interesting
[deletion]subject[/deletion][insertion]inquiry[/insertion] & which I have every
reason to hope will [deletion][insertion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/insertion][/deletion] facilitate
[deletion]to a great extent[unclear]xx xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
the means of laying open
to the literary world [deletion][insertion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] of[/insertion] these[/deletion] the
contents that will exist of these
precious remains of antiquity
In examining the fragments
I find [insertion]no reason to adopt the common opinion of their[/insertion][deletion]that there was no reason[/deletion]
having been converted into charcoal by heat
[deletion]to suppose that they had been[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

[deletion]I [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] to any considerable degree[/deletion]
[deletion]of heat for had this been the[/deletion]
[deletion]case their texture must have[/deletion]
[deletion]been destroyed & their parts[/deletion]

On the contrary the change that

[page]257|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00257|dnp10253pp|92017915[/page]
237
for[deletion]I found that[/deletion] they yielded a considerable
quantity of volatile matter when heated & were
similar in their [deletion]appearance[/deletion] [insertion]properties[/insertion] to wood
that has been long buried beneath the soil
& exhibited a uniform texture & a brown
colour [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]; - & their appearance as
well as their chemical qualities shew
that the change [deletion]that[/deletion][insertion]which[/insertion] has taken place
in the papyrus is owning to the slow operation
of natural causes. - In endeavouring to
separate the layers of the papyrus on which
the characters exist, there appeared an evident

[page]258|MS-DAVY-11000-000-00258|dnp10254pp|92017916[/page]
238
adhesion depending upon some substance diffused
through the leaves of the  MS. - From the
smell emitted by the fragments when heated
it occurred to me that this substance
might be bituminous or asphaltic similar
to that which is usually [deletion]formed in[/deletion] found in
4
wood partially converted into coal. -
 - To determine this I exposed a portion
of one of the fragments to heat in close
vessels & I found that it gave

gas similar in its nature to coal
gas which could not have been
the case had it been from charcoal
- I afforded likewise an ammoniacal
empyreumatic fluid smelling strongly
of naphtha & partly neutralized
by acetous acid; On distilling
the smallest part of the MS
the same products were evolved
so that there was evidently
some asphaltic matter in them
 capable of [deletion]de[/deletion] being decomposed
by heat. -
I endeavoured to ascertain its
nature by various chemical tests
& to separate it without
injuring the [deletion]MS[/deletion] texture of
the MS; I found that, alcohol

244
In examining by a magnifying
glass the texture of the layers as
they appear in their coherent
state it was evident that
there was a brilliant
substance [deletion]when[/deletion] generally
disseminated through the
[deletion]papyrus; substance of[/deletion] the MS
but this [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] substance had
disappeared in the specimens
that had been acted upon
by the ether. -
- These results rendered it almost
 [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] certain that the strong
adherence of the layers of the
MS [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] which offers the great
difficulty [deletion]in[/deletion] to the unfolding
them is owing to an asphaltic

245
substance which has formed during
[deletion]this[/deletion] their decomposition; & that
[deletion]by removing[/deletion]the removal of
this will render the separation
of the layers comfortably
easy. -
I tried several experiments as
to the best mode of destroying
this natural cement which
has so long closed off these remains
[deletion]treasures[/deletion] of [deletion]the[/deletion] ancient literature
[deletion]- I found that in heat very[/deletion]

[deletion]causes them to break irregularly[/deletion]

produced an irregular separation of
the layers [deletion]in[/deletion] & in drying the [insertion]leaves[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] after

that the substance to be applied
[deletion]if[/deletion] should be gaseous so that its weight
[insertion]or mechanical agency[/insertion] should not interfere & that it should
destroy the cement without acting

reflection it occurred to me that
chlorine would answer this purpose
for it acts powerfully upon almost all
compounds containing hydrogene & has
no effect upon charcoal.- I [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[insertion]quickly recalled[/insertion] some of the matter separated

In this instance the chlorine
enters between the layers in the

recommend [deletion]to the[/deletion] according to the
suggestion of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Gary, that the MS
[deletion]they be [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] should be carefully sawed

Sickler had operated appeared to

have been compressed by a weight

[deletion]and formed a coloured solution and muriatic ether dissolved it still[/deletion]
[deletion]more rapidly and became of a much deeper hue[/deletion]
[deletion]After a fragment had been exposed to ether and the[/deletion]
[deletion]ether evaporated from it and the fragment carefully dried the[/deletion]
[deletion]layers of papyrus separated with much facility and greek cha-[/deletion]
[deletion]racters distinctly appeared upon each separate layer -[/deletion]
[deletion]- In examining by a magnifying glass the texture of the[/deletion]
[deletion]layers as they appear in their coherent state it was evident that[/deletion]
[deletion]there was a brilliant substance generally disseminated through[/deletion]
[deletion]the MS but this substance had disappeared in the specimens[/deletion]
[deletion]that had been acted upon by ether[/deletion]
[deletion]These results rendered it almost certain that the strong[/deletion]
[deletion]adherence of the layers of the MS which offers the great difficulty[/deletion]
[deletion]to the unfolding them is owing to an asphaltic substance which[/deletion]
[deletion]has formed during the decomposition and that the removal of this[/deletion]
[deletion]will render the [insertion]separating of the[/insertion] layers comparatively easy[/deletion]
[deletion]I tried several experiments as to the best mode of[/deletion]
[deletion]destroying this natural cement which has so long closed up these[/deletion]
[deletion]remains of ancient literature - The fluid solvents I found by[/deletion]
[deletion]their weight produced an irregular separation of the layers and in[/deletion]
[deletion]drying the leaves after their application they were always found[/deletion]
[deletion]deranged or broken This created a difficulty It was necessary[/deletion]
[deletion]that the substances to be applied should be gaseous so that[/deletion]
[deletion]its weight or mechanical agency should not interfere and that[/deletion]
[deletion]it should destroy the cement without acting on carbonaceous[/deletion]
[deletion]matter. After much reflection it occurred to me that[/deletion]
[deletion]chlorine [insertion]or iodine[/insertion] would answer this [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] for [insertion]they[/insertion] act powerfully upon[/deletion]

almost [deletion]almost[/deletion] all compounds containing hydrogen and have
no effect upon charcoal - I gently heated some of the matter
separated from the fragments by ether in chlorine and I found
that it was rapidly decomposed and afforded muriatic acid
gas and a small quantity of a volatile fluid and left a
dense charcoal behind
Encouraged by this result I tried the effect of the action
of chlorine [insertion]& of iodine[/insertion] upon [deletion]a[/deletion] parts of the MS which consisted of several layers
and I had the satisfaction to find that they separated from each
other so that the leaves of the papyrus appeared distinct and
with the greek characters upon them in a perfect state
[deletion]I made several experiments on the best method of[/deletion]
[deletion]applying this process I found that [deletion]the[/deletion] fragments of [insertion]the[/insertion]different[/deletion]
[deletion]MS were differently acted upon by the gas [insertion]& N[superscript]o[/superscript] 2 & 3 more violently[/insertion] in [deletion]general[/deletion] there[/deletion]
[deletion]was heat produced and the colour became browner with an[/deletion]
[deletion]absorption of the gas - I found that it was not safe to suffer[/deletion]
[deletion]this absorption to proceed far as in this case the earthy matter of[/deletion]
[deletion]the papyrus was acted upon and its general texture injured[/deletion]
[deletion]But by immersing the fragments in chlorine for a minute[/deletion]
[deletion]or two and then drawing off the elastic products by heat gradual[/deletion]
[deletion]raised to redness in close vessels there was an almost entire[/deletion]

The action of iodine was less intense & it was

[deletion]The more applications of heat without chlorine[/deletion]

as if it had been pressed together when in a perpendicular

I exposed a small quantity of each of these
fragments to the proof of distilation
& I found that they all gave off elastic
fluid; the brownest in largest proportion
which proved to be of the same nature
as coal gas: & this afforded different

- It was evident from the different results
that the carbonaceous appearance of the
MS had not been owing to any [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
sudden & violent action of heat; but that
the change they had undergone was owing
to the [deletion]long[/deletion] slow operation of [deletion]an[/deletion] the
natural chemical affinities of their
elements, during a long course of ages.
 - A conclusion which is confirmed by
 the state of the city in which they
were found, Herculaneum as I have
convinced myself by actual observations
 is buried not by lava but by
tufa; which has been[deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

in N[superscript]o[/superscript] 1 were very distinct & perfect. -
- It was evident from this fact that the
strong adherence of the leaves of the papyri
depended on a great measure upon
a bituminous or extractive substance
similar to those which form in peat or
wood coal & which by being [unclear]diffused[/unclear] though
the substance of the MSS offered an
obstacle to the development of separate
 leaves.
I tried several experiments as to the best
mode of destroying this natural cement
which has so long closed up these
remains of ancient literature. The
fluid solvents, I found by their weight
produced an irregular separation of
the layers; - yet with [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] proper precautions
I have no doubt they might be used,
in some cases, particularly for acting upon
the exterior [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] parts with great success.
- I tried the operation of heat,
in close vessels, I found that when it was
rapidly raised, the elastic fluids formed
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] burst through the folds of the
MS & destroyed a part, but by applying
it very slowly & keeping the fragment of the
MS; with the direction of the layers perpendicular
the cement was decomposed without injuring
the texture of the layers of the papyrus & the
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the charcoal of the letters appeared
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] distinct from that of the layers. -

Having witnessed some of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Sickler's attempts to
unfold the Herculaneum Manuscripts it occurred to me that
a chemical examination of the nature of the Manuscripts
and of the changes they had undergone might offer some data
as to the best methods to be attempted for unrolling them
On mentioning this to Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt he obligingly put
into my hands[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] fragments of [insertion]two MS one of which had been operated upon by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hayter & the other by D[superscript]r[/superscript]Sickler &[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] which (the principal
parts being destroyed) were proper to be sacrificed to experiment
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Young likewise gave one [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] small portion of a MS which had been placed in
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]his hands by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt,[/insertion] I began a chemical examination of the subject
furnished with these speciments [deletion][unclear]xx)[/unclear][/deletion] to which I shall refer in the order in which they have [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
and in the course of my experiments ascertained several
facts which throw considerable light on this interesting inquiry
and which I have every reason to hope will facilitate the
means of laying open to the literary world the contents that
shall exist of these precious remains of antiquity
On examining the fragments I found no reason to adopt
the common opinion of their having been converted into char-
coal by heat [deletion]On the contrary the change that[/deletion] for though
they differed in appearance yet [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] portions of all of them when heated
yielded a considerable quantity of volatile matter [deletion]when[/deletion]

which has taken place in the papyrus is owing to the slow
operation of natural causes - on endeavouring to separate
the layers of the papyrus in which the characters exist there
appeared an evident adhesion depending upon some substance
diffused through the leaves of the MS - From the smell
emitted by the fragments when heated it occurred to me
that this substance might be bituminous or [deletion]its nature[/deletion]
asphaltic similar to that which is usually found in wood
partially converted into coal.
To determine this I exposed a portion of one of the
fragments to heat in close vessels and I found that it gave
off a considerable quantity of inflammable gas similar
in its nature to coal gas which could not have been the
case had it been pure charcoal. It afforded likewise an
ammoniacal empyreumatic fluid smelling strongly of
naphtha and partly neutralise by acetous acid - on distilling
the smallest portion of the manuscript the same produc
were evolved so that there was evidently some asphaltic matter
in them capable of being decomposed by heat
I endeavoured to ascertain its nature by various
chemical tests and to separate it without injuring the texture
 of the MS. I found that alcohol did not dissolve it nor boiling
water but sulphuric ether became slightly coloured by being
kept long in contact with a piece of MS and when
evaporated left a yellow matter which on being decom-
 posed by heat had the smell of asphalt mixed with a
peculiar aromatic smell and was highly inflammable[/blockdeletion]
