This volume and a similar one
foolscap size contain certain original papers
of Sir H. Davy. It was part of my duty to
copy the papers after he had written them
roughly. Sir H. Davy frequently wrote over
these and then I had to copy again until
a fair paper was produced which went to
the Society or the Printer. The originals
used to be torn up or destroyed until I
begged I might be allowed to keep them for
myself and here they are.
