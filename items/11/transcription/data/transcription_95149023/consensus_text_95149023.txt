- The slight effervescence taking place in
this process induced me to suppose that
the substance which coloured the acid
must contain a larger proportion of
oxygene than euchlorine for I have shewn
in a work published in 1812 that Hyperoxymuriate
of Potassa contains 6 proportions of oxygene
& by its decomposition [deletion]3[/deletion] 2.5 volumes of oxygene
ought to be evolved for every volume of
chlorine: & euchlorine procured from
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the Hyperoxymuriate of Potassa by [insertion]solution of[/insertion] muriatic
acid yields only 1 Volume of oxygene
& 2 volumes of chlorine.
- I endeavored to procure the substance
which coloured the sulphuric acid
during its action upon hyperoxymuriate
of Potassa & after several failures
in which explosions took place
I at length succeeded in the
following manner.
