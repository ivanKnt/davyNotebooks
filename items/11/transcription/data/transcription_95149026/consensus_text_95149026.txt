When it is heated to a temperature
[deletion]equal to[/deletion] about that of boiling water
it explodes [insertion]with more violence than euchlorine & greater expansion of volume[/insertion] producing much light. - After
the explosion over mercury rather less than 3 (from 2.7 to 2)
volumes appear for two of the gas decomposed
& of these, [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] two are oxygene &
the remainder chlorine. -
A little chlorine is always absorbed by the
mercury driving the explosion of the gas
& it appears reasonable to conclude -
[deletion]from the results that I have obtained[/deletion]
that the [deletion]orange coloured[/deletion] [insertion]deep yellow[/insertion] gas is in
reality composed of 2 in volume of oxygene
& 1 of chlorine condensed into the space
of two volumes & that it consists in weight
of one proportion of chlorine 67 & 4 of
oxygene 60: -
- None of the combustible bodies [deletion]on[/deletion] which
[deletion]I have made exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][deletion] [insertion]I have tried[/insertion] decompose this gas
at common temperatures except phosphorous
