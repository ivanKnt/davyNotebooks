procured from [deletion]at[/deletion] the hyperoxymuriate by
the action of liquid muriatic acid might
be a mere mixture of this gas &
chlorine; [deletion]but though he[/deletion] & 2 in volume
of this gas & 3 in volume of
chlorine would produce by explosion 
the same products as Euchlorine.
As M. Ampere has observed the expansion
[deletion]of the[/deletion] of volume of Euchlorine in decomposition
does not agree with that of other
analogous compounds, & its mixed smell
