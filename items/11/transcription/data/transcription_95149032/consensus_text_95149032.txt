1/20 of oxygene; the fifth proportion obtained

during the time the mixture was made.
- The saturated solution of the gas affords
white fumes similar to those produced at
the moment the [insertion]hydro[/insertion] sulphuric mixture is made
from which it is probable that these
fumes [deletion]are compounds of the gas & water[/deletion]
consist of a hydrate of the gas.
-. The saturated solution when mixed
with solutions of fixed alkalies or of
ammonia does not immediately
lose its colour; [deletion]but after some time[/deletion]
nor neutralize the alkalies; but
after some time this effect is
produced & hyperoxymuriaties [insertion]are produced (probably[/insertion] mixed
with [deletion]new[/deletion] a minute quantity of muriates)
