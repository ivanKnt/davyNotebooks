& that it is analogous to the other Hyperoxymuriates
which an triple compound of inflammable [deletion]substances[/deletion]
bases chlorine & oxygene in which the base &
the chlorine determine the character of the compound.
Muriate of Potassa (Potassane) is a perfectly neutral
body & when six proportions of oxygene are
added to it it still remains neutral. -
Muriatic acid (chlorine & hydrogene) is a strong
acid & according to the relation above
stated it ought not to lose its acid
powers by the addition of six proportions of
oxygene -. Till a pure combination of
Chlorine & oxygene is obtained possessed of
acid properties we have no right to
say [deletion]that in the hyperoxymuriates[/deletion] that
Chlorine [deletion]exists[/deletion] [insertion]is capable of being[/insertion] acidified by oxygene
& that an acid compound exists in the
hyperoxymuriates;- We know that chlorine
is capable of being [deletion]acidified[/deletion] [insertion]converted into an acid[/insertion] by hydrogene
& as I mentioned in my last paper
where this principle exists its energies
ought not be overlooked; & all the new
facts confirm an opinion which I have
more than once before submitted to the
consideration of the society, namely that acidity
does not depend upon any peculiar elementary
