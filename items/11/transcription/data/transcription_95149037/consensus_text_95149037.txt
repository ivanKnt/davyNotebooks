The effects produced when concentrated hydro sulphuric acid
(oil of vitriol) is poured upon Hyperoxymuriate of Potassa have
been often objects of chemical discussion the acid & the salt it is
well known become deep orange and if any moisture is present
or if heat is applied to the mixture a detonation occurs - In
a paper read before the Royal society I have ventured to suppose
that those phenomena depend upon the development & sudden
decomposition of the compound of chlorine and oxygene which I
have named euchlorine.
A statement which I understand has been made by M. Gay
Lussac namely that a peculiar and which he has called chloric acid
may be procured from the hyperoxymuriate of baryta by sulphur-
ic acid led me to examine the action of [deletion]the[/deletion] acids on the hyperoxy-
muriates under new circumstances and I have made some observa-
tions which appear to me not unworthy of being communica-
ted to the Royal Society.
If 30 or 40 parts of sulphuric acid be poured upon dry hyperoxy-
muriate of potassa in a wine glass and the salt be agitated in the
