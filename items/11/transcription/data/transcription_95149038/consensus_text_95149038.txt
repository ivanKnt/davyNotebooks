acid there is a very slight effervescence only the acid becomes of 
deep orange tint and white fumes mixed with orange fumes
fill the upper part of the glass which have a very peculiar and
not a disagreeable smell.
The slight effervescence taking place in this process induced me
to suppose that the substance which coloured the acid must con-
tain a larger proportion of oxygene than euchlorine for I have shewn
in a work published in 1812 that hyperoxymuriate of potassa
contains six proportions of oxygene and by its decomposition 2.5
volumes of oxygene ought to be evolved for every volume of chlorine
& euchlorine evolved from the hyperoxymuriate of potassa by solu
tion of muriatic acid yields only 1 Volume of oxygene and 2
volumes of chlorine.
I endeavoured to procure the substance which colored the sul-
phuric acid during its action upon hyperoxymuriate of potassa
and after several failures in which explosions took place I at
length succeeded in the following manner
Dry oxymuriate of potassa in powder was mixed with a small
quantity of sulphuric acid and they were rubbed together with a
spatula of platinum till they had incorporated and formed
a solid mass of a bright orange colour. This mass was introduced
a small retort of glass and exposed to the heat of water which
was gradually warmed a bright yellowish green elastic fluid arose
from the mixture which was rapidly absorbed by water giving to it
its own tint but which had no sensible action on mercury
To make this experiment without danger not more than 50 or
60 gr of the hyperoxymuriate should be employed great care should
