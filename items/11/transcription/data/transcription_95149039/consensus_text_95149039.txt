be taken to prevent any combustible matter from being present &
the water should not be permitted to attain a temperature equal
to 212Â° which may be easily managed by mixing it with alcohol
There are dense white fumes when the mixture is first made but
there seems to be no heat produced. A small quantity of the orange gas
is disengaged at this time but the greater part of it remains attached to
the sulphuric acid in the solid mass and is expelled from it by the heat
The gas procured in this [deletion]manner[/deletion] process over mercury when
compared with the gas procured from the hyperoxymuriate by
liquid muriatic acid is found to have a much more brilliant colour
is much more rapidly absorbed by water has a peculiar & much more
aromatic smell unmixed with any smell of chlorine It destroys
moist vegetable blues without previously reddening them
When it is heated to a temperature about that of boiling wa-
ter it explodes more violently than euchlorine and with greater
expansion of volume producing much light After the explosion
over mercury rather less than 3 (from 2.7 to 2.9) volumes appear
for two of the gas decomposed and of these two are oxygene and
the remainder chlorine.
A little chlorine is always absorbed by the mercury during
the explosion of the gas and it appears reasonable to conclude
that the deep yellow gas is in reality composed of 2 in volume of
oxygene and 1 of chlorine condensed into the space of 2 volumes &
that it consists in weight of one proportion of chlorine 67 and four
of oxygene 60.
None of the combustible bodies which I have tried decompose this gas
at common temperature except phosphorus this when introduced
into it occasions an explosion & burns in the liberated gasses with
