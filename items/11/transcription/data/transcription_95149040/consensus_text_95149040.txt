great brilliancy
Its saturated solution in water is of a deep yellow colour it does not taste
sour but is extremely astringent and corroding and when applied to the tongue
leaves for a long while a very disagreeable sensation.
It occurred to me that the gas procured from the hyperoxymuriate by the
action of [insertion]liquid[/insertion] muriatic acid might be a mere mixture of this gas and chlorine
and two in volume of this gas and three in volume of chlorine would pro-
duce by explosion the same products as euchlorine. As M. Ampere has observed
the expansion of volume of euchlorine in decomposition does not agree with
that of other analogous compounds & its mixed smell offers another argument
in favour of the supposition of its containing a mixture of chlorine. - The only
fact that I am acquainted with opposed to the idea is the circumstance of
dutch foil not burning spontaneously in the gas from muriatic acid
which might be expected if it contained as much as 3/5 of uncombined
chlorine though the force of, this argument is suspended till it is supported
by an experiment shewing that dutch foil inflames in a mixture of
2 of the deep yellow gas and 3 of Chlorine - I have not yet been able to
procure at Rome metallic foil fitted for this experiment.
I have ascertained that the gas from hyperoxymuriate & muriatic
acid though it acts much more slowly upon water than the other gas yet
in the end gives it the same tint & properties and when much of it is
exposed to a small quantity of water it always leaves a residuum
of chlorine so that if it be not a mixture but a compound the
new gas is formed from it by [deletion]water[/deletion] the action of water
The action of hydronitric acid on the hyperoxymuriates affords the
same gas as that produced by the action of sulphuric acid and a much
larger quantity of nitric acid may be safely made to act on the salt
but as it must be procured in solution it is always mixed with about 1/5
