of oxygene From the solid mixture made with sulphuric acid and I have
obtained a gas containing only 1/20 of oxygene. The fifth proportion obtained
in the experiments with nitric acid being evolved during the time the mix-
ture was made.
The saturated solution of the gas [deletion]produces[/deletion] [insertion]affords[/insertion] white fumes similar to
those produced at the moment the hydro sulphuric mixture is made
from which it is probably that these fumes consist of a hydrate of
the gas
The saturated solution when mixed with solutions of the fixed
alkalies or of ammonia does not immediately lose its colour
nor neutralize the alkalies but after some time this effect is produced
and hyperoxymuriates are produced (probably mixed with a
minute quantity of muriates).
The solution exposed to air or suffered to remain in close vessels
becomes soon colourless & I am inclined to believe that this depends
upon a decomposition of water for some of it exposed to a small
quantity of air rather increased its volume
I shall not propose to give any name to this substance till
it is determined whether euchlorine is a mixture or a definite
compound and I hope soon to have the means of making a
decisive experiment of this [deletion]point[/deletion] subject
It appears that this new substance though it contains four
proportions of oxygene is not an acid & hence it is probable that
the acid fluid compound of oxygene chlorine & water which
M Gay Lussac calls chloric acid owes its acid powers to combined
hydrogene and that it is analogous to the other hyperoxymu-
riates which are triple compounds of inflammable bases chlorine
