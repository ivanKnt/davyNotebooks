and oxygen in which the base and the chlorine determine the
character of the compound Muriate of Potassa (Potassane) is a per-
fectly neutral body and when six proportions of oxygene are
added to it it still remains neutral - Muriatic acid [deletion]is a[/deletion]
[deletion]strong acid[/deletion] (chlorine & hydrogene) is a strong acid and according
to the relations above stated it ought not to lose its acid powers
by the addition of six proportions of oxygene - Till a pure
combination of chlorine and oxygene is obtained possessed of acid
properties we have no right to say that chlorine is capable
of being acidified by oxygene and that an acid compound
exists in the hyperoxymuriates. We know that chlorine
is capable of being converted into an acid by hydrogene
and as I mentioned in my last paper where this prin
ciple exists its energies ought not to be overlooked and all
the new facts confirm an opinion which I have more
than once before submitted to the consideration of the Soci
ety namely that acidity does not depend upon any
peculiar elementary [deletion]principle[/deletion] substance but upon
peculiar combinations of many different substances
It will be easy to ascertain if Euchlorine be
a definite compound of 2 of Chlorine & 1 of oxygene
condensed into the space of 2 by ascertaining its
specific gravity with care;- If this idea be correct
it ought to be heavier than Chlorine; if [deletion]not[/deletion]
it is a mixture of the new gas it ought to be
