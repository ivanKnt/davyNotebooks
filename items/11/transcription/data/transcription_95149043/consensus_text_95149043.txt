Lighter Ascertained this day March 12
that to a colour of extraordinary brightness said
to be cornine on the walls of Pompeii is vermilion
Ascertained the 10 of March that powdered
antimony, burnt in a mixture of 1 of
Chlorine & 2 of common air; but it did
not burn in Euclorine but afforded
only 1 of oxygene to 2 of Ch[superscript]l[/superscript] by its
decomposition â€“ Ascertained likewise
that fluoric acid fumes precipitates
a white matter from Chlorinic acid
- which turns out to be a combination or mix
of fluorine lead & Iodine
- - Fluoric acid made from lead
does not touch iodine at least only
dissolves a very little of it
dissolves oxyiodine; but does not
seem to form a permanent union
& does not destroy it or become
a new body from its action; yet a
little purplish matter precipitated from the
acid is thus a compound of "[underline]Iodine & fluorine[/underline]"
