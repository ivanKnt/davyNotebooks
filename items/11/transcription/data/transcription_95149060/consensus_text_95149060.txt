[deletion]breaking the coal[/deletion]
The Rev.[superscript]d[/superscript] M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hodson informed me
that in pounding some common Newcastle
Coal in a cask furnished with
a small aperture, the gas from
the aperture was inflammable; &
on breaking some large lumps
of coal under water, I ascertained
that they gave off inflammable
gas. [insertion][deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hodgson likewise informed me[/deletion] gas is likewise disengaged from bituminous shist when it worked.[/insertion]  The great sources of the
[deletion]inflammable gas[/deletion] [insertion]fire damp[/insertion] in mines are
[insertion]however[/insertion] what are called blowers
or fissures [deletion]when there are[/deletion]
[deletion]for[/deletion] in the [insertion]broken[/insertion] strata [insertion]near dykes[/insertion] from which
currents of fire damp issue [insertion]sometimes[/insertion]
in considerable quantity [insertion]sometimes [deletion]sometimes[/deletion] often[/insertion] for
[deletion]many[/deletion] years [insertion]for a long course of[/insertion] [deletion]in succession[/deletion].- When
old workings are broken into
likewise they are often found filled
with fire damp; & the deeper the mine in general the more common
is this substance. -
