I have analysed several specimens
of fire damp [deletion]the purest were[/deletion]
the [deletion]flam[/deletion] [insertion]pure[/insertion] inflammable part was
the same in all of them.- [deletion]perfectly[/deletion]
[deletion]from light hydrocarbonates[/deletion]; but
it was [insertion]sometimes[/insertion] mixed with small quantity
of Atmospherical air; & in one
instance with Azote & carbonic
acid.-
- Of six specimens collected by M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Dunn * from [deletion]the[/deletion] a blower [insertion]in the Hepburn colliery by emptying bottles of water [deletion]near[/deletion] close to it[/insertion] [deletion]in the[/deletion]
[deletion]Hepburn colliery[/deletion] the purest contained
1/15 only of atmospherical air with
no other contamination, & the
more impure contained 5/12 of atmospherical
air so that this air was probably
derived from the circumambient air of
the mine
* Sketches are annexed of the position of the blowers in the Hepburn
colliery and likewise of the effects of what is called by the miners a creep
