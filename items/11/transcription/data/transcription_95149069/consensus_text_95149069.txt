in [insertion]brilliant[/insertion] combustion it [deletion]did inflame[/deletion] [insertion]produced the effect [deletion]explode[/deletion][/insertion] a mixture
[deletion]of the gases[/deletion].-
- The flame of gaseous oxide of
Carbon as well as of olefiant
gas exploded, the mixture of
the fire damp. -
-.- : In [deletion]the[/deletion] respect [insertion]of combustibility[/insertion] the fire damp
differs most materially from the other common
inflammable gases. Olefiant gas
[insertion]which [deletion]explodes[/deletion] I have found explodes[/insertion] mixed in the same proportions
with air fired by both charcoal
& iron heated to dull redness. -
- Gaseous oxide of Carbon which
explodes when mixed with two
parts of air is likewise inflammable
by hot iron & charcoal.
- And Hydrogene which explodes when
mixed with 1/3 its volume of air
explodes at the lowest visible heat
of iron & charcoal. & [underline]The case[/underline] is the same
with sulphuretted hydrogene
