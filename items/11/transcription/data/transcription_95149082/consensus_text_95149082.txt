constructed the bellows lamp; in which
a very small bellows supplied air to a
close lamp connected with the atmosphere [deletion]only[/deletion]
by a tube containing a column of [deletion]water[/deletion] fluid
When an explosive mixture is pressed
through the bellows so as to reach the
flame it explodes [insertion]and extinguishes the light[/insertion] but neither communicates
[deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]the flame to[/insertion] the mixture in the bellows nor
to the atmosphere in the tube. -
- -. The first apparatus that I had constructed
when I [deletion]a[/deletion] supposed that the fire damp
would be equally explosive with other inflammable
gases was one still more complicated &
[deletion]a[/deletion] which I shall call the piston lamp
- in this the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] air was pressed by
a small piston [insertion]having two valves like that of a compressing apparatus apparatus[/insertion] into a close lamp furnished
like the bellows lamp with a tube above
& perfectly airtight; & in this apparatus
mixtures of even hydrogene [deletion]have[/deletion] I found
might be exploded without communicating
with the external air.
- But both the bellows lamp & the
piston lamp like the steel mill require
a person to work them; - & the necessity
of trying them in [deletion]the[/deletion] coal mines appears
