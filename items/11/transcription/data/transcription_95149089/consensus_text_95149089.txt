The fire damp appears to be constantly
found in coal mines, though in very different
quantities & the cause seems to be that
the coal strata formed under a pressure greater
than that of the atmosphere give off
elastic fluid when they are exposed to the
free atmosphere:- & probably coals containing
animal remains evolve not only
the fire damp but likewise Azote &
carbonic acid as in the instance
 of the gas sent by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny -
In the apennines near Pietra Mala, I
examined a fire produced by gaseous matter
constantly disengaged from a shist stratum
& from the results of the combustion
I have no doubt that it was pure
