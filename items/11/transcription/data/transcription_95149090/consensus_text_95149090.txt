collected some gas from a [deletion]cave[/deletion] cavity
in the earth [insertion]about a mile from pietra mala[/insertion] then filled with water;
& which from the quantity of gas disengaged
 is called Aqua buja - I analysed it
in the grand Dukes laboratory at
Florence & found that it was pure
light hydrocarbonate [deletion]case[/deletion] requiring two
volumes of oxygene for its combustion
& producing a volume of carbonic acid.-
- It is very probabl[deletion]y[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion] that these gasses
are disengaged from coal strata beneath
the surface; or from bituminous shist:
above coal & at some future
period new sources of riches
may be opened to Tuscany from
this invaluable mineral treasure.
the use of which in this country
has supplied such extraordinary
resources to industry.-
