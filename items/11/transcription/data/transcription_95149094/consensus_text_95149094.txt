the resources of modern science had been fully employed; and
that a mode of preventing accidents was only to be sought for
in a method of lighting the mines free from danger and

The common means employed for lighting those parts of the
mine where danger is apprehended from the fire damp is by
a steel wheel which being made to revolve in contact with
flint affords a succession of sparks but this apparatus requires a
person always to work it and though much less liable to explode
the fire damp than a common candle yet it is said to be
not entirely free from danger

light required for working the collieries I made several experiments
with the hope of producing such a degree of light without active
