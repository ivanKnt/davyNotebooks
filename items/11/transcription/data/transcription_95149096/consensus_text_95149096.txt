coal mines during the common process of working
The Rev[superscript]d[/superscript]. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hodgson informed me that on pounding
some common newcastle coal in a cask furnished with a
small aperture the gas from the aperture was inflamma-
ble: and on breaking some large lumps of coal under water
I ascertained that they gave off inflammable gas*- Gas is
likewise disengaged from bituminous shist when it is worked
The great sources of the fire damp in mines are however
 [deletion]called blowers[/deletion] what are called blowers or fissures in the broken
strata near dykes from which currents of fire damp issue
in considerable quantity and sometimes for a long course of
years. When old workings are broken into likewise they are
often found filled with fire damp and the deeper the
mine in general the more common is this substance
I have analysed several specimens of the fire damp the
pure inflammable part was the same in all of them but
it was sometimes mixed with small quantities of atmospherical
air and in one instance with azote and carbonic acid
Of six specimens collected by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dunn from a blower in
the Hepburn colliery by emptying bottles of water close to it: The purest
contained 1/15 only of atmospherical air with no other contamination
and the most impure contained 5/12 of atmospherical air so that

[deletion]colliery and likewise of the effects of what is called by the miners a creep[/deletion]
