produced by gaseous matter constantly disengaged from a shist
stratum and from the results of the combustion I have no
doubt that it was pure fire damp. M[superscript]r[/superscript]. M. Faraday who
accompanied me and assisted me in my chemical experiments
in my journey collected some gas from a cavity in the earth
about a mile from Pietra Mala then filled with water &
which from the quantity of gas disengaged is called [underline]Acqua[/underline]
[underline]Buja[/underline] I analyzed it in the Grand Duke's laboratory at Florence
and found that it was pure light hydro carbonate requiring
2 Volumes of oxygene for its combustion and producing a volume
of carbonic acid
It is very probable that these gases are disengaged from
coal strata beneath the surface or from bituminous shist
above coal and at some future period new sources of riches
may be opened to Tuscany from this invaluable mineral
treasure the use of which in this country has supplied
such extraordinary resources to industry.
