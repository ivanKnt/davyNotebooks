this air was probably derived from the circumambient air of the mine
- The weight of the purest specimen was for 100 cubical inches 19.5 gr.
One measure of it required for its complete combustion by the
electric spark nearly 2 measures of oxygene and they formed
nearly one measure of carbonic acid.
Sulphur heated strongly; and repeatedly sublimed in a portion
of it freed from oxygene by phosphorus produced a considerable
enlargement of its volume sulphuretted hydrogene was formed
and charcoal precipitated and it was found that the volume
of the sulphuretted hydrogene produced when it was absorbed by
solution of potassa was exactly double that of the fire damp
decomposed.
It did not act upon chlorine in the cold but when an electri
cal spark was passed through a mixture of 1 part of it with
2 of chlorine there was an explosion with a diminution to less
than 1/4 and much charcoal was deposited
The analyses of specimens of gas sent to my friend John
George Children Esq[superscript]r[/superscript]. by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Clanny afforded me similar results
[deletion]and tried[/deletion] [insertion]but they contained variable quantities of carbonic acid gas & azote. Different specimens of these gases were tried[/insertion] by the test of exposure to chlorine both in darkness &
light, they exhibited no marks of the presence of olefiant gas or
hydrogene and the residuum produced by detonation with chlorine
showed them to be free from carbonic oxide
It is evident then that [insertion]opinion formed by other chemists respecting[/insertion] the fire damp [deletion]is the same substance[/deletion]
is perfectly correct & that it is [deletion]compound[/deletion] the same substance
