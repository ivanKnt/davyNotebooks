I made several experiments on the combustibility and explosive
nature of the fire damp. When one part of the fire damp was
mixed with one of air they burnt by the approach of a lighted
taper but did not explode 2 of air & 3 of air to 1 of gas
produced similar results. When 4 of air & 1 of gas [deletion]wh[/deletion] were expo-
sed to a lighted candle the mixture being in the quantity
of 6 or 7 cubical inches in a narrow necked bottle a flame
descended through the mixture but there was no noise. 1
part of gas inflamed with 6 parts of air in a similar bottle
produced a slight whistling sound 1 part of gas with 8 parts of
 air rather a louder sound 1. part with 10. 11. 12 [deletion]&[/deletion] 13 [insertion]& 14[/insertion] parts [deletion]of[/deletion]
still inflamed but the violence of combustion diminished In
1 part of gas and 15 parts of air the candle burnt without explo -
sion with a greatly enlarged flame and the effect of enlarging
the flame but in a gradually diminishing ratio was produced
as far as 30 parts of air to 1 of gas.
The mixture which seemed to possess the greatest explosive
