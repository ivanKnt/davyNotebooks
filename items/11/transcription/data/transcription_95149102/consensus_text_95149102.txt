powers was that of 7 or 8 parts of air to one of gas but
the report produced by 50 cubical inches of this mixture
was less than that produced by 1/10 of the quantity of a
mixture of 2 parts of atmospherical air and 1 of hydrogen
It was very important to ascertain the degree of heat required
to explode the fire damp mixed in its proper proportion
with air |_ I found a strong electrical spark would not explode
5 parts of air and 1 of fire damp but it exploded [deletion][/deletion] 6 parts
of air and 1 of damp. Well burned charcoal ignited to the
strongest [insertion]red[/insertion] heat did not explode any mixture of air and of the
fire damp And a fire made of well burned charcoal i.e.
charcoal that burned without flame was flown up to white-
ness by an explosive mixture containing the fire damp
without producing its inflammation - An iron bar at the
highest degree of red heat and at the common degree of white
heat did not inflame explosive mixtures of the fire damp
but when actually in brilliant combustion it produced the effect
The flame of gaseous oxide of carbon as well as olefiant
gas exploded the mixtures of the fire damp
In respect of combustibility, the fire damp differs most
materially from the other common inflammable gases. Olefiant
gas which I have found explodes mixed in the same propor-
tions with air, is fired by both charcoal and iron heated to
dull redness Gaseous oxide of carbon which explodes when
mixed with 2 parts of air is likewise inflammable by [insertion]red[/insertion] hot
