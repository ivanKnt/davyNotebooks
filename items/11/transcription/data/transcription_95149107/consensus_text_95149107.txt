with a bladder by a stopcock having an
aperture of about 1/6 of an inch, I found
that the flame passed into the Atmosphere,
but did not communicate through the
stop cock so as to inflame the mixture
in the bladder: And in comparing
the power of tubes of metal & those of glass
it appeared that the flame passed
more readily through glass tubes of the
same diameter: & that explosions
were stopped by metallic tubes of 1/5
of an inch when they were two inches
long & this phaenomenon seems to depend
upon the heat lost during the explosion
in contact with so great a cooling
surface which brings the temperature
of the first portions exploded below
that required for the firing of the other
portions. Metal is a better conductor
of heat than glass & it has been already
shewn that the fire damp requires a very
strong heat for its inflamation.
