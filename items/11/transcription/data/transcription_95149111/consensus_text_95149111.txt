I tried several experiments on

fire damp.
 I inclosed a taper in a [deletion]small[/deletion] [insertion]little[/insertion] close lantern having [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]small[/insertion] aper-
ture [deletion]above & below[/deletion] [insertion]below & a larger one above[/insertion] of such size that the taper burnt with a
flame a little below its natural size I placed this lantern the
taper being lighted on a stand under a large glass receiver
standing in water having a curved tube containing a little water
adapted to its top to confine the air and which was of such a
capacity as to enable the candle to burn for some minutes.
I then rapidly threw a quantity of fire damp into the receiver
from a bladder so as to make the atmosphere in it explosive
As the fire damp mixed with the air the flame of the taper
gradually enlarged so that it half filled the lantern it then
rapidly diminished and was suddenly extinguished without
the slightest explosion. I examined the air of the receiver after
this experiment and found it highly explosive.
I tried similar experiments throwing in mixtures of air
and fire damp some containing the maximum and
others the minimum of fire damp necessary for explosion
and always with the same satisfactory results. The flame
