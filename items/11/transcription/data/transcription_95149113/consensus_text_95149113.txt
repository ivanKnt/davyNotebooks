considerably increased and was soon extinguished.
I introduced the lighted lantern into an atmosphere
containing an explosive mixture of fire damp and air
the air being to the hydrocarbonate as about 12 to 1 in a
large jar opened in the atmosphere it burnt at first with
a feeble light the flame soon became enlarged and was then
extinguished. I repeated these experiments several times
and with a perfect constancy of result.
It is obvious then that to prevent explosions in coal
mines it is only necessary to use [deletion]close[/deletion] [insertion]air tight[/insertion] lanterns supplied
with air from [deletion]apertures [/deletion] [insertion]small[/insertion] tubes at some distance from the
flame and having a chimney at the upper part [insertion]or a similar arrangement of tubes[/insertion] for carry-
ing off the foul air; and common lanterns may be easily
adapted to the purpose by being [deletion]made air tight in the[/deletion] [insertion]made air tight[/insertion]
door and sides by being furnished with [deletion]chimney and[/deletion] [insertion]the chimney[/insertion]
& the system of safety
[deletion]by being supplied with air [insertion]through tubes of small diameter[/insertion] only at a distance from the[/deletion]
[insertion]tubes below & above - [/insertion] [deletion]flame so as to produce a mixture of the explosive gas[/deletion]
[deletion]with the air of the lantern rendered partially impure by[/deletion]

The principle being known it is easy to adopt and
multiply practical applications of it
I have had a lantern constructed with different tubes
