It does not appear by what I have learnt from all the miners
that breathing an atmosphere containing a certain mixture
of fire damp * below the explosive point is attended with
any bad consequence .- I ascertained that a bird lived in a mix-
ture of equal parts of fire damp and air but he soon began to
shew symptoms of suffering I found a slight head ache produced
by breathing for a few minutes an explosive mixture of fire
damp and air and if merely the health of the miners be
considered the fire damp ought always to be kept far below the
point of its explosive mixture.

an explosion has taken place this is easily explained when it
is considered that the explosion is almost always limited to a
particular spot and that it mixes the residual air with
much common air and supposing 1 of fire damp to 13 of
air to be exploded there will still remain nearly 1/3 of the
original quantity of oxygene in the residual gas and in
some experiments made 16 years ago I found that an
 animal lived though with suffering for a short time in a gas
containing 100 parts of Azote 14 parts of carbonic acid & 7 parts
of oxygene
* This shows that the inflammable gas of marshes is not the
cause of maladies.
