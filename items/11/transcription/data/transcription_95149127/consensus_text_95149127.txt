with air would extinguish the safe lantern yet certain explosive
mixtures of them might enter the lantern after this extinction
and in some cases be exploded by the wick for the true fire
damp is the only inflammable gas that is not fired by
ignited charcoal and therefore supposing an atmosphere to
be contaminated by olefiant gas gazeous oxide of carbon
hydrogene or sulphuretted hydrogene it would be necessary
that the flame should be extinguished before the mixture
of the gas had reached the explosive point
- In some experiments that I tried on the gas procured from the
distillation of coal I found it uniformly in all the stages of the
process explosive when mixed in certain proportions with atmos-
pheric air by ignited iron or charcoal and this was owing to the
olefiant gas mixed with the light hydrocarbonate in the first stage
and to the gazeous oxide of carbon and hydrogene mixed with it in
the last stage & by mixing from 1/4 to 1/8 of olefiant gas or gazeous
oxide of carbon with the fire damp of the coal mines I made
mixtures explosive by red hot iron or charcoal when common air
was added to them
But nevertheless I have several times extinguished the safe lamp by
throwing into it explosive mixtures of the gas from the distillation of
coal and air and I never had an explosion except in two cases
when I used a small lantern in which there was a perfectly
