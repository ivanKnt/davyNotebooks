free circulation of air and in which the flame was nearer
than usual to the air apertures and in these instances the effect
appeared to be produced by the gas that entered after the extinction of the
flame and came in contact with the ignited wick a circum-
stance that can never occur with the true fire damp.
Very early in my enquiries on the explosive powers of mixtures of
air with fire damp [deletion]I found that when fire damp or the gas[/deletion]

bellows supplies air to a close lamp connected with the atmos

explosive mixture is pressed through the bellows so as to reach
the flame it explodes and extinguishes the light but neither
communicates the flame to the mixture in the bellows nor
to the atmosphere in the tube
