that the fire damp would be equally explosive
with other inflammable gasses was one still
more complicated & which I shall call
the piston lamp. In this the air was
pressed by a small piston having two
valves like that of a compressing apparatus
into a close lantern furnished like the
bellows lamp with a tube above [deletion]& below[/deletion]
& perfectly air tight: & in this apparatus
mixtures of even Hydrogene & air may
be exploded without any danger of
communicating flame to the external
air: But both the bellows lamp
& the piston lamp like the steel mill
require a person to work them & the
necessity of trying them in coal
mines appear to be done away by
those properties of the fire damp
on which the safety lantern is founded.
Models of these lanterns & [underline]of the [/underline] fire valve
lamp are placed in the apparatus room of
The Royal Institution.-
