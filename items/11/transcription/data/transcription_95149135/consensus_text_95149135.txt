Fig. 1. The safe lantern. A are the apertures for admitting
air B is the aperture for the exit of foul air and is a moveable top
when the lamp to be supplied with oil the top is taken out. This
lamp burns with a flame always less than in the air and the
size and number of the apertures must be adapted to the size of the
wick so as to produce this effect.
Fig. 2 is a valve lamp it agrees in its construction with
the other but has fastened in the top a thermometrical spring
composed of brass and steel rivetted together the expansion of which
when the flame is much increased by the coal damp closes the
aperture and extinguishes the light.
