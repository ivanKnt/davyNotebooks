Fig.3 is similar to Fig 2 but the thermometrical spring A
moves a valve B and when it expands cuts off the communica-
tion with the external air.
Fig. 4. Is the bellows lamp in this the air is pressed in by a
small pair of bellows through a metallic tube of such diameter
that explosion is not communicated through it and the air
consumed passes is at C.
