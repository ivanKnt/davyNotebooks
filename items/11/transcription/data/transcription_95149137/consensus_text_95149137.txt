[sketch of a piston lamp]
Fig 5. is the piston lamp in principle like Fig. 4 except
that it is secure for the explosion of all gases even mixtures of
hydrogene may be safely exploded in it
These two last apparatus's are as easily worked as the steel
mill and not much larger
In every mine in which the safety lamps are used a
proper person should always be appointed to keep them in
order and to feed them with oil and the workmen should
never be permitted to open them where there is danger from
fire damp This may be effected by closing the tops with
small padlocks of which the overseer or lamp man or boy
should keep the key.
It is necessary that except when the air is admitted &
expelled these apparatus's should be perfectly air tight.
