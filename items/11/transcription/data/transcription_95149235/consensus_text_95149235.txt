The correctness of these conclusions are
still further proved by the circumstance
that though Nitrous gas & Chlorine
have no action upon each other
when perfectly dry yet if water
is present there is an immediate
decomposition & Nitrous acid [deletion]gas[/deletion]
& muriatic acid are formed .-
- It is easy to calculate the [deletion]proportions[/deletion] [insertion]quantity[/insertion]
[deletion]in which[/deletion] of chlorine [deletion]is[/deletion] produced
in Nitromuriatic acid [deletion]are[/deletion] by
the doctrine of definite proportions.
- For for every 101 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] in weight
of Nitric acid [deletion]or for every[/deletion] [insertion]equivalent to[/insertion] 118 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] in
weight of hydronitric acid decomposed
67 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of chlorine must be produced. -
