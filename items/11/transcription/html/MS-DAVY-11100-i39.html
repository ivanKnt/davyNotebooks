         <p>French chemist and physicist, known mostly for his discovery that water is made of
            two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen by volume (with Alexander von Humboldt), for
            two laws related to gases, and for his work on alcohol-water mixtures. Became involved
            in controversies with Davy over various chemical discoveries. ForMemRSL.</p>

         <p>An element and the heaviest of the group of stable halogens. Bernard Courtois was
            the first to isolate the&nbsp;substance. Whilst in Paris&nbsp;Davy&nbsp;investigated the&nbsp;substance,&nbsp;and&nbsp;proved
            it to be a chemical&nbsp;element&nbsp;describing his results in a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;the Royal Society.
            This caused disputes between Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who had also been researching
            the element.</p>
