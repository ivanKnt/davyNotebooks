This volume and a similar one
foolscap size contain certain original papers
of Sir H. Davy. It was part of my duty to
copy the papers after he had written them
roughly. Sir H. Davy frequently wrote over
these and then I had to copy again until
a fair paper was produced which went to
the Society or the Printer. The originals
used to be torn up or destroyed until I
begged I might be allowed to keep them for
myself and here they are.

[underline]On the actions of acids on the salts[/underline]
[underline]usually called Hyperoxy [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] muriates[/underline]
by Sir H Davy. LLD. FRS. -
Rome Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] 10[superscript]th[/superscript]
[underline]1815[/underline].-
-. The effects produced when concentrated [insertion]hydro[/insertion] sulphuric
acid [deletion]the[/deletion] oil of vitriol is poured upon Hyperoxymuriate
of Potassa have been often objects of chemical
discussion, the acid & the salt it is well
known becne deep orange [insertion]&[/insertion] , if any moisture is
present [deletion]a detonation occurs[/deletion]: or if heat
is applied to the mixture a detonation
occurs - In a paper read before
the Royal Society I have ventured to
suppose that these phaenomena depend upon
the developement & [deletion]d[/deletion] sudden decomposition
of the compound of chlorine & oxygene
which I have named euchlorine.
A statement which I understand has been
[deletion]In examining the phaenomena of the action[/deletion]
made of by M. Gay Lussac namely that a peculiar
[deletion]of acids on the hyperoxymuriates with[/deletion]
acid which he has called chloric acid may

[page]26||dnp11002pp|95149022[/page]
[underline]2[/underline] 2
he procured from the hyperoxymuriate of
Baryta by Sulpheric acid led me to
examine the action of acids on the hyproxymuriates
under new circumstances & I have made
some observations which appear to me
not unworthy of being enumerated
to the Royal Society.
[deletion]-. At the line that hyperoxymuriate[/deletion]
[deletion]of Potassa is he[/deletion]
If [insertion]30 or 40 pts of[/insertion] sulphuric acid be poured upon
dry hyperoxymuriate of Potassa in [deletion]a glass[/deletion]
[deletion]common[/deletion] wine glass & the salt be
agitated in the acid, there is a
very slight effervescence only, the acid
becomes of a deep orange tint
& white fumes mixed with orange fumes
fill the upper part of the glass
which have a very peculiar
& not a disagreable smell.-

[page]27||dnp11003pp|95149023[/page]
[underline]3[/underline]
- The slight effervescence taking place in
this process induced me to suppose that
the substance which coloured the acid
must contain a larger proportion of
oxygene than euchlorine for I have shewn
in a work published in 1812 that Hyperoxymuriate
of Potassa contains 6 proportions of oxygene
& by its decomposition [deletion]3[/deletion] 2.5 volumes of oxygene
ought to be evolved for every volume of
chlorine: & euchlorine procured from
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the Hyperoxymuriate of Potassa by [insertion]solution of[/insertion] muriatic
acid yields only 1 Volume of oxygene
& 2 volumes of chlorine.
- I endeavored to procure the substance
which coloured the sulphuric acid
during its action upon hyperoxymuriate
of Potassa & after several failures
in which explosions took place
I at length succeeded in the
following manner.

[page]28||dnp11004pp|95149024[/page]
Dry oxymuriate of Potassa in powder was
mixed with a small quantity of sulphuric
acid & they were rubbed together
with a [deletion]platinum[/deletion] spatula of platinum
till they had incorporated & formed
a solid mass; of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] a bright orange
colour - This mass was introduced
into a small retort of glass &
exposed to the heat of water which
was gradually warmed [deletion]till it attained[/deletion]
[deletion]a temperature[/deletion] a [deletion]deep[/deletion] [insertion]bright yellowish green[/insertion] [deletion]orange coloured[/deletion]
elastic fluid arose from the mixture
which was rapidly absorbed by water
giving to its own tint [deletion]bright yellow colour similar[/deletion]
[deletion]rendering it of an orange colour[/deletion]; but
which had no sensible action on
mercury. -
To make this experiment without
danger not more than 50 or 60 grains
of the Hyperoxymuriate should be employed great
care should be taken to prevent any
[deletion]items of[/deletion] combustible matter from being present
acid & they were added together
[underline]4[/underline] 4

[page]29||dnp11005pp|95149025[/page]
[underline]5[/underline]
& the water should not be permitted to
attain a temperature equal to 212°
which may be easily managed by mixing it
with alcohol. - There are dense white
fumes when the mixture is first made
but there seems to be no heat produced
[deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] small quantity [insertion][deletion]which I find is[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]of oxygene produced[/deletion] [insertion[deletion]generated[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]during[/deletion]
[deletion]the process[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]of mixing[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]is disengaged with a little[/deletion] of the
orange gas; [insertion]is disengaged at this time[/insertion] but the greater part of [deletion]this[/deletion]
[deletion]last substance[/deletion] it remains [insertion]attached to the sulphuric acid[/insertion] in the solid mass
& is [deletion]disengaged[/deletion] [insertion]expelled[/insertion] from it [deletion]only[/deletion] by [insertion]the[/insertion] heat.
-.- The gas procured by this process [insertion]over mercury[/insertion] when
compared with the gas procured from [deletion]Hyperoxymuriate[/deletion]
[deletion]of P[/deletion] the [deletion]same salt[/deletion] [insertion]Hyperoxy[superscript]e[/superscript][/insertion] by [deletion]a[/deletion] liquid muriatic acid is
found to have a much more brilliant
colour is much more rapidly absorbed
by water; has a peculiar [insertion]& much more[/insertion] aromatic smell
unmixed with any smell of chlorine; It
destroys [insertion]moist[/insertion] vegetable blues without previously
[deletion]rendered[/deletion] reddening them.

[page]30||dnp11006pp|95149026[/page]

When it is heated to a temperature
[deletion]equal to[/deletion] about that of boiling water
it explodes [insertion]with more violence than euchlorine & greater expansion of volume[/insertion] producing much light. - After
the explosion over mercury rather less than 3 (from 2.7 to 2)
volumes appear for two of the gas decomposed
& of these, [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] two are oxygene &
the remainder chlorine. -
A little chlorine is always absorbed by the
mercury driving the explosion of the gas
& it appears reasonable to conclude -
[deletion]from the results that I have obtained[/deletion]
that the [deletion]orange coloured[/deletion] [insertion]deep yellow[/insertion] gas is in
reality composed of 2 in volume of oxygene
& 1 of chlorine condensed into the space
of two volumes & that it consists in weight
of one proportion of chlorine 67 & 4 of
oxygene 60: -
- None of the combustible bodies [deletion]on[/deletion] which
[deletion]I have made exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][deletion] [insertion]I have tried[/insertion] decompose this gas
at common temperatures except phosphorous

[page]31||dnp11007pp|95149027[/page]

This when introduced into it occasions an explosion
[deletion]its instant decomposition[/deletion] & burns in
the liberated gases with great brilliancy.-
- Its saturated solution in water is of a deep
yellow colour [deletion][unclear] xxxx[/unclear] & when[/deletion] it does not taste
sour; but is extremely astringent & corroding
[deletion]& [unclear]xxxxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] when applied to the
tongue leaves for a long while a

- It occurred to me that the gas
procured from [deletion]at[/deletion] the hyperoxymuriate by
the action of liquid muriatic acid might
be a mere mixture of this gas &
chlorine; [deletion]but though he[/deletion] & 2 in volume
of this gas & 3 in volume of
chlorine would produce by explosion 
the same products as Euchlorine.
As M. Ampere has observed the expansion
[deletion]of the[/deletion] of volume of Euchlorine in decomposition
does not agree with that of other
analogous compounds, & its mixed smell

[page]32||dnp11008pp|95149028[/page]

offers another argument in favour of
the supposition; [deletion]yet it is very[/deletion]
[deletion]improbable[/deletion] of its containing a mixture
of chlorine. The only fact which
I am acquainted with opposed to the
[deletion]the suppo[/deletion] idea is the circumstance
of [deletion]copper[/deletion] [insertion]dutch[/insertion] foil not burning [insertion]spontaneously by [deletion]Euchlor[/deletion][/insertion] in [deletion]a mixture[/deletion]
[deletion]containing as much as 3/5 of chlorine[/deletion]
the gas from muriatic acid which
might be expected if it contained as

1/20 of oxygene; the fifth proportion obtained

- The saturated solution of the gas affords
white fumes similar to those produced at

consist of a hydrate of the gas.

- It appears that this new substance
though it contains [deletion]one for[/deletion] four
proportions of oxygene is not an [deletion]true[/deletion]

& that it is analogous to the other Hyperoxymuriates
which an triple compound of inflammable [deletion]substances[/deletion]
bases chlorine & oxygene in which the base &
the chlorine determine the character of the compound.
Muriate of Potassa (Potassane) is a perfectly neutral
body & when six proportions of oxygene are
added to it it still remains neutral. -
Muriatic acid (chlorine & hydrogene) is a strong
acid & according to the relation above
stated it ought not to lose its acid
powers by the addition of six proportions of
oxygene -. Till a pure combination of
Chlorine & oxygene is obtained possessed of
acid properties we have no right to
say [deletion]that in the hyperoxymuriates[/deletion] that
Chlorine [deletion]exists[/deletion] [insertion]is capable of being[/insertion] acidified by oxygene
& that an acid compound exists in the
hyperoxymuriates;- We know that chlorine
is capable of being [deletion]acidified[/deletion] [insertion]converted into an acid[/insertion] by hydrogene
& as I mentioned in my last paper
where this principle exists its energies
ought not be overlooked; & all the new
facts confirm an opinion which I have
more than once before submitted to the
consideration of the society, namely that acidity
does not depend upon any peculiar elementary

On the action of Acids on the Salts
usually called Hyperoxymuriales
by Sir H. Davy L.L.D. F.R.S. -
[horizontal rule]
[underline]Rome Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] 10[superscript]th[/superscript] 1815[/underline]
The effects produced when concentrated hydro sulphuric acid
(oil of vitriol) is poured upon Hyperoxymuriate of Potassa have
been often objects of chemical discussion the acid & the salt it is
well known become deep orange and if any moisture is present
or if heat is applied to the mixture a detonation occurs - In
a paper read before the Royal society I have ventured to suppose
that those phenomena depend upon the development & sudden
decomposition of the compound of chlorine and oxygene which I
have named euchlorine.
A statement which I understand has been made by M. Gay
Lussac namely that a peculiar and which he has called chloric acid
may be procured from the hyperoxymuriate of baryta by sulphur-
ic acid led me to examine the action of [deletion]the[/deletion] acids on the hyperoxy-
muriates under new circumstances and I have made some observa-
tions which appear to me not unworthy of being communica-
ted to the Royal Society.
If 30 or 40 parts of sulphuric acid be poured upon dry hyperoxy-
muriate of potassa in a wine glass and the salt be agitated in the

[page]42||dnp11016pp|95149038[/page]

acid there is a very slight effervescence only the acid becomes of 
deep orange tint and white fumes mixed with orange fumes
fill the upper part of the glass which have a very peculiar and
not a disagreeable smell.
The slight effervescence taking place in this process induced me
to suppose that the substance which coloured the acid must con-
tain a larger proportion of oxygene than euchlorine for I have shewn
in a work published in 1812 that hyperoxymuriate of potassa
contains six proportions of oxygene and by its decomposition 2.5
volumes of oxygene ought to be evolved for every volume of chlorine
& euchlorine evolved from the hyperoxymuriate of potassa by solu
tion of muriatic acid yields only 1 Volume of oxygene and 2
volumes of chlorine.
I endeavoured to procure the substance which colored the sul-
phuric acid during its action upon hyperoxymuriate of potassa
and after several failures in which explosions took place I at
length succeeded in the following manner
Dry oxymuriate of potassa in powder was mixed with a small
quantity of sulphuric acid and they were rubbed together with a
spatula of platinum till they had incorporated and formed
a solid mass of a bright orange colour. This mass was introduced
a small retort of glass and exposed to the heat of water which
was gradually warmed a bright yellowish green elastic fluid arose
from the mixture which was rapidly absorbed by water giving to it
its own tint but which had no sensible action on mercury
To make this experiment without danger not more than 50 or
60 gr of the hyperoxymuriate should be employed great care should

[page]43||dnp11017pp|95149039[/page]
[underline]3[/underline] 17
be taken to prevent any combustible matter from being present &
the water should not be permitted to attain a temperature equal
to 212° which may be easily managed by mixing it with alcohol
There are dense white fumes when the mixture is first made but
there seems to be no heat produced. A small quantity of the orange gas
is disengaged at this time but the greater part of it remains attached to
the sulphuric acid in the solid mass and is expelled from it by the heat
The gas procured in this [deletion]manner[/deletion] process over mercury when
compared with the gas procured from the hyperoxymuriate by
liquid muriatic acid is found to have a much more brilliant colour
is much more rapidly absorbed by water has a peculiar & much more
aromatic smell unmixed with any smell of chlorine It destroys
moist vegetable blues without previously reddening them
When it is heated to a temperature about that of boiling wa-
ter it explodes more violently than euchlorine and with greater
expansion of volume producing much light After the explosion
over mercury rather less than 3 (from 2.7 to 2.9) volumes appear
for two of the gas decomposed and of these two are oxygene and
the remainder chlorine.
A little chlorine is always absorbed by the mercury during
the explosion of the gas and it appears reasonable to conclude
that the deep yellow gas is in reality composed of 2 in volume of
oxygene and 1 of chlorine condensed into the space of 2 volumes &
that it consists in weight of one proportion of chlorine 67 and four
of oxygene 60.
None of the combustible bodies which I have tried decompose this gas
at common temperature except phosphorus this when introduced
into it occasions an explosion & burns in the liberated gasses with

[page]44||dnp11018pp|95149040[/page]
[underline]4[/underline] 18
great brilliancy
Its saturated solution in water is of a deep yellow colour it does not taste
sour but is extremely astringent and corroding and when applied to the tongue
leaves for a long while a very disagreeable sensation.
It occurred to me that the gas procured from the hyperoxymuriate by the
action of [insertion]liquid[/insertion] muriatic acid might be a mere mixture of this gas and chlorine
and two in volume of this gas and three in volume of chlorine would pro-
duce by explosion the same products as euchlorine. As M. Ampere has observed
the expansion of volume of euchlorine in decomposition does not agree with
that of other analogous compounds & its mixed smell offers another argument
in favour of the supposition of its containing a mixture of chlorine. - The only
fact that I am acquainted with opposed to the idea is the circumstance of
dutch foil not burning spontaneously in the gas from muriatic acid
which might be expected if it contained as much as 3/5 of uncombined
chlorine though the force of, this argument is suspended till it is supported
by an experiment shewing that dutch foil inflames in a mixture of
2 of the deep yellow gas and 3 of Chlorine - I have not yet been able to
procure at Rome metallic foil fitted for this experiment.
I have ascertained that the gas from hyperoxymuriate & muriatic
acid though it acts much more slowly upon water than the other gas yet
in the end gives it the same tint & properties and when much of it is
exposed to a small quantity of water it always leaves a residuum
of chlorine so that if it be not a mixture but a compound the
new gas is formed from it by [deletion]water[/deletion] the action of water
The action of hydronitric acid on the hyperoxymuriates affords the
same gas as that produced by the action of sulphuric acid and a much
larger quantity of nitric acid may be safely made to act on the salt
but as it must be procured in solution it is always mixed with about 1/5

[page]45||dnp11019pp|95149041[/page]
[underline]5[/underline] 19
of oxygene From the solid mixture made with sulphuric acid and I have
obtained a gas containing only 1/20 of oxygene. The fifth proportion obtained
in the experiments with nitric acid being evolved during the time the mix-
ture was made.
The saturated solution of the gas [deletion]produces[/deletion] [insertion]affords[/insertion] white fumes similar to
those produced at the moment the hydro sulphuric mixture is made
from which it is probably that these fumes consist of a hydrate of
the gas
The saturated solution when mixed with solutions of the fixed
alkalies or of ammonia does not immediately lose its colour
nor neutralize the alkalies but after some time this effect is produced
and hyperoxymuriates are produced (probably mixed with a
minute quantity of muriates).
The solution exposed to air or suffered to remain in close vessels
becomes soon colourless & I am inclined to believe that this depends
upon a decomposition of water for some of it exposed to a small
quantity of air rather increased its volume
I shall not propose to give any name to this substance till
it is determined whether euchlorine is a mixture or a definite
compound and I hope soon to have the means of making a
decisive experiment of this [deletion]point[/deletion] subject
It appears that this new substance though it contains four
proportions of oxygene is not an acid & hence it is probable that
the acid fluid compound of oxygene chlorine & water which
M Gay Lussac calls chloric acid owes its acid powers to combined
hydrogene and that it is analogous to the other hyperoxymu-
riates which are triple compounds of inflammable bases chlorine

[page]46||dnp11020pp|95149042[/page]
[underline]6[/underline] 20
and oxygen in which the base and the chlorine determine the
character of the compound Muriate of Potassa (Potassane) is a per-
fectly neutral body and when six proportions of oxygene are
added to it it still remains neutral - Muriatic acid [deletion]is a[/deletion]
[deletion]strong acid[/deletion] (chlorine & hydrogene) is a strong acid and according
to the relations above stated it ought not to lose its acid powers
by the addition of six proportions of oxygene - Till a pure
combination of chlorine and oxygene is obtained possessed of acid
properties we have no right to say that chlorine is capable
of being acidified by oxygene and that an acid compound
exists in the hyperoxymuriates. We know that chlorine
is capable of being converted into an acid by hydrogene
and as I mentioned in my last paper where this prin
ciple exists its energies ought not to be overlooked and all
the new facts confirm an opinion which I have more
than once before submitted to the consideration of the Soci
ety namely that acidity does not depend upon any
peculiar elementary [deletion]principle[/deletion] substance but upon
peculiar combinations of many different substances
It will be easy to ascertain if Euchlorine be
a definite compound of 2 of Chlorine & 1 of oxygene
condensed into the space of 2 by ascertaining its
specific gravity with care;- If this idea be correct
it ought to be heavier than Chlorine; if [deletion]not[/deletion]
it is a mixture of the new gas it ought to be

On the methods that may be adopted
[underline]for preventing the accidents arising from[/underline]
[underline]explosions of the fire damp in coal[/underline]
[underline]mines. . by Sir. H D.[/underline]
The accidents arising from the explosion
of the fire damp or inflammable gas of
coal mines mixed with atmospherical air
are actually becoming more frequent
& more terrible in the collieries in the
North of England.-
A committee has been for some time
formed at Sunderland for the [insertion]benevolent[/insertion] purpose of
investigating the causes of these accidents
& of searching for means of preventing
them. the consequence of an invitation
from the Rev[superscript]d[/superscript] D[superscript]r[/superscript] Gray are of the
most active members of this committee

[page]58||dnp11032pp|95149054[/page]

I was induced to turn my attention
to the subject. I went to the North
of England & visited [insertion]some of[/insertion] the principal
collieries in the neighborhood of
Newcastle [deletion]& conversed with some[/deletion]
[deletion]of the most intelligent[/deletion] for the
purpose of ascertaining the [deletion]state[/deletion] [insertion]condition[/insertion] of
the [deletion]collieries[/deletion] [insertion]workings[/insertion] & [deletion]of[/deletion] their ventilation.
- I found the greatest desire to
[deletion]assist in particular[/deletion] [insertion]to assist my enquiries[/insertion] [deletion]both[/deletion] in the
coal owners, [deletion]& in the Inspectors[/deletion]
[deletion]or viewers of the mines[/deletion] & the
Gentlemen acquainted with the state [insertion][deletion]condition[/deletion][/insertion]
at the Northern collieries [insertion]as well as the Inspectors or viewers of the mines[/insertion] & I have
particular obligations on this point
to Cuthbert Ellison Esq[superscript]r[/superscript] MP, the Rev[superscript]d[/superscript]
John Hodgson, D[superscript]r[/superscript] Fenwick D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny

From the information which I collected
on the spot increased by the perusal
of a [deletion]pamphlet[/deletion] [insertion]report[/insertion] of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Buddle on
the state of mines, [deletion]that[/deletion] I
[deletion]the[/deletion] was convinced that as far
as ventilation was concerned [deletion]all[/deletion]
the resources of modern science
had been fully [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] employed
& that a mode of preventing
accidents was only to be sought
for in a method of lighting
the mines free from danger
& which by indicating the state
of the air in the part of
the [deletion]workings[/deletion] [insertion]mine[/insertion] where inflammable
air was disengaged [insertion]so as to render the atmosphere explosive[/insertion] [deletion]should[/deletion] explosive 
[insertion]should[/insertion] oblige the miners to retire [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] till
[deletion]the mixture [insertion]air[/insertion] became explosive[/deletion]
till the workings were properly cleared

An account of an ingenious [unclear][deletion]xxxxx[/deletion][/unclear] apparatus
for [deletion]lamp[/deletion] [insertion]burning a[/insertion] candle [deletion]burning excluded[/deletion]
[deletion]from [/deletion] supplied with Atmospherical air
through water has been published
in the [insertion]Phil:[/insertion] transactions by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny;
but [insertion]all[/insertion] the Viewers [insertion]Inspectors[/insertion] of the mines stated
to me that its size [insertion]and the necessity of manual labour[/insertion] [deletion]had prevented[/deletion]
in [deletion]working[/deletion] [insertion]employing[/insertion] it had hitherto prevented them
them from [deletion]using its making trials of using it[/deletion]
adopting it in collieries.
The common means [deletion]of[/deletion] employed for
lighting those parts of the mine
where danger is apprehended from
the fire damp is by a steel
wheel which [insertion]being made to[/insertion] revolve in contact
with flint affords a [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] succession
of sparks; [deletion]of in[/deletion] but this apparatus
requires a person always to work
it; & though much less liable
to explode the [deletion]mixtures of[/deletion] the fire
damp than a common candle yet it

[page]61||dnp11035pp|95149057[/page]

is said to be not entirely free from
danger.-
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Buddle having obligingly shewn to
me the degree of light required
for working the collieries I [deletion]tried[/deletion] made
several [deletion]experiments[/deletion] [insertion]experiments with the hope of [/insertion] for producing [deletion]this[/deletion] such
[deletion]light[/deletion]a degree of light without
active inflammation; I tried [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
Kunckels Cantons & [deletion]Baldw[/deletion]
Baldwins Phosphorus & likewise
the electrical light in close
vessels: but without success & even
had these degrees of light been
sufficient the processes for obtaining
them [deletion]would have[/deletion] I found could be
too complicated & difficult for
the miner. -
-The fire damp has been generally
considered by chemists as the light hydrocarbonate

[page]62||dnp11036pp|95149058[/page]

or; but I do not know of any
exact experiments or accurate
analysis [insertion]on which this opinion is founded[/insertion] [deletion]of the substance[/deletion]; & it
appeared to me [deletion]probable[/deletion] [insertion]proper[/insertion] that
a minute chemical examination
of this substance [deletion]& its relations[/deletion]
[deletion]to combustion[/deletion] & of its sources
in the mine [deletion]might would[/deletion]
[deletion]be afford the best [unclear]xxx[/unclear] elu[/deletion]
should be the [unclear][deletion]xxxx[/deletion][/unclear] preliminary
step to the inquiry respecting
methods of preventing its explosion -
- I therefore procured specimens
of the fire damp in its purest
state and made a number
of experiments upon it & in
examining its relations to combustion

[page]63||dnp11037pp|95149059[/page]

I was so fortunate to discover
a property of it, which rendered
it easy to [deletion]burn lights[/deletion]
adopt methods of lighting the mines
[deletion]in the mine[/deletion] without danger
[deletion]of[/deletion] to the miners & which
I hope will supply the desideratum
so long anxiously required
by humanity. - I shall
in the following pages have
the honour of describing these properties
& [insertion][deletion]the[/deletion][/insertion] methods [insertion]founded upon them[/insertion] to the Royal Society
& I shall preface them by a
chemical account of the gas
& follow them by some general
observations. -

quantities in coal mines during

[deletion]breaking the coal[/deletion]
The Rev.[superscript]d[/superscript] M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hodson informed me
that in pounding some common Newcastle
Coal in a cask furnished with
a small aperture, the gas from
the aperture was inflammable; &
on breaking some large lumps
of coal under water, I ascertained
that they gave off inflammable
gas. [insertion][deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hodgson likewise informed me[/deletion] gas is likewise disengaged from bituminous shist when it worked.[/insertion]  The great sources of the
[deletion]inflammable gas[/deletion] [insertion]fire damp[/insertion] in mines are
[insertion]however[/insertion] what are called blowers
or fissures [deletion]when there are[/deletion]
[deletion]for[/deletion] in the [insertion]broken[/insertion] strata [insertion]near dykes[/insertion] from which
currents of fire damp issue [insertion]sometimes[/insertion]
in considerable quantity [insertion]sometimes [deletion]sometimes[/deletion] often[/insertion] for
[deletion]many[/deletion] years [insertion]for a long course of[/insertion] [deletion]in succession[/deletion].- When
old workings are broken into
likewise they are often found filled
with fire damp; & the deeper the mine in general the more common
is this substance. -

I have analysed several specimens

the same in all of them.- [deletion]perfectly[/deletion]
[deletion]from light hydrocarbonates[/deletion]; but
it was [insertion]sometimes[/insertion] mixed with small quantity
of Atmospherical air; & in one
instance with Azote & carbonic
acid.-
- Of six specimens collected by M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Dunn * from [deletion]the[/deletion] a blower [insertion]in the Hepburn colliery by emptying bottles of water [deletion]near[/deletion] close to it[/insertion] [deletion]in the[/deletion]
[deletion]Hepburn colliery[/deletion] the purest contained
1/15 only of atmospherical air with
no other contamination, & the
more impure contained 5/12 of atmospherical
air so that this air was probably
derived from the circumambient air of
the mine
* Sketches are annexed of the position of the blowers in the Hepburn
colliery and likewise of the effects of what is called by the miners a creep

The weight of the purest specimen was

& [deletion]this[/deletion] it was found* that
the volume of the sulphuretted

absorbed by [insertion]sol. of[/insertion] Potassa was exactly double
that of the fire damp decomposed.

there was [insertion]an explosion with a[/insertion] [deletion]a very great[/deletion] diminution
[deletion]&[/deletion] to less than 1/4 of & [deletion]a large[/deletion] [insertion]much[/insertion] [deletion]quantity[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] charcoal was deposited.-
The analysis of specimens of gas
sent to my friend John G Children
Esq[superscript]r[/superscript] by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny afforded me
similar results: & tried by the test
[deletion]-It is evident the heat the[/deletion]

[deletion]no[/deletion] exhibited no marks of the
presence of olefiant gas or hydrogene
- & the residuum produced by
detonation with chlorine shewed
them to be free from carbonic

- It is evident then that

[page]68||dnp11042pp|95149064[/page]
12 42
the fire damp is the same substance
as the inflammable gas of the marshes
the [insertion]exact[/insertion] chemical nature of which was
first demonstrated by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton.
& that it consists according to my
view of definite proportions of
4 proportions of hydrogene in weight
4 & of one proportion of charcoal
in weight 11.5* .-
† .-. This gas has been called light Hydrocarbonate
& light carburetted hydrogene: & the gas made

by the Dutch Chemists [underline]olefiant gas[/underline] has been
named heavy carburetted hydrogene: Amongst
the many imperfections of the nomenclature
* - I do not adopt oxygene as unity with [superscript]Mr[/superscript] Berzelius &
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Wollaston [deletion]& D[superscript]r[/superscript] [unclear]Xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] because in this case
hydrogene must be expressed by a fractional part

I made several experiments on the combustibility
& explosive nature of the fire damp. When
1 pt of fire damp was mixed with one of
which the [insertion][deletion]minor[/deletion][/insertion] British Chemists [insertion]have[/insertion] adopted [insertion][deletion]with so little consideration for the enlightened of their native country[/deletion][/insertion] from the
French is the length of the words &
yet their want of definitiveness. It appears
to me that in simple termination might
express the class of those gases that contain
hydrogene with an inflammable solid & that
Carbon gas & carbonic gas (the one being the
expletive as in Italian might [deletion]properly[/deletion] express
the two substances & that a similar plan might

-The mixture which seemed to possess

It was very important to ascertain the
degree of heat required to explode
the fire damp mixed in its proper proportion
with air. I found a strong electrical
spark would not explode 5 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
[deletion]the[/deletion] air and 1 of fire damp; but it
exploded 6 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of air & 1 of damp.
- [insertion]wellburned[/insertion] Charcoal ignited to the strongest
red heat did not explode any
mixture of air & of the fire damp -
And a fire made of well burned
charcoal (ie charcoal that burned
without flame was blown up to whiteness
by an [deletion]mixture of[/deletion] explosive mixture
containing the fire damp without
producing its inflammation.
An iron bar at the highest degree
of red heat & at the common
degree of white heat did not inflame
[deletion]explode[/deletion] explosive mixtures of
the fire damp; but when actually

[page]73||dnp11047pp|95149069[/page]
17
47
in [insertion]brilliant[/insertion] combustion it [deletion]did inflame[/deletion] [insertion]produced the effect [deletion]explode[/deletion][/insertion] a mixture
[deletion]of the gases[/deletion].-
- The flame of gaseous oxide of
Carbon as well as of olefiant
gas exploded, the mixture of
the fire damp. -
-.- : In [deletion]the[/deletion] respect [insertion]of combustibility[/insertion] the fire damp
differs most materially from the other common
inflammable gases. Olefiant gas
[insertion]which [deletion]explodes[/deletion] I have found explodes[/insertion] mixed in the same proportions
with air fired by both charcoal
& iron heated to dull redness. -
- Gaseous oxide of Carbon which
explodes when mixed with two
parts of air is likewise inflammable
by hot iron & charcoal.
- And Hydrogene which explodes when
mixed with 1/3 its volume of air
explodes at the lowest visible heat
of iron & charcoal. & [underline]The case[/underline] is the same
with sulphuretted hydrogene

[page]74||dnp11048pp|95149070[/page]
18 48
It is evident from these facts that
a mine containing fire damp might
be lighted by a charcoal fire so made
as not to form gaseous oxide of
Carbon [insertion]that is [unclear]calctus[/unclear] of a single stratum of coal[/insertion] without any danger.
-But [deletion]a few consider[/deletion] [insertion]the foregoing[/insertion] facts & [insertion]a few[/insertion] considerations
[insertion]on them[insertion] [deletion]will explain[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]explain lead[/deletion] led me to[/insertion] a much simpler
& better mode of effecting the
object.-
If in a [insertion]close[/insertion] lantern supplied with
an aperture above & another
 below [insertion]a flame[/insertion] [deletion]at[/deletion] [insertion]lamp[/insertion] candle of a certain size
[deletion]diameter[/deletion] burns freely; a [deletion]much[/deletion]
[deletion]larger[/deletion] flame [insertion]of a much longer[/insertion]; will burn less freely,
& if the flame [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
increased beyond a certain size
it becomes extinguished; the Azote
& carbonic acid increasing most
rapidly burn is compensated for

[page]75||dnp11049pp|95149071[/page]
19
49
by the current of [insertion]fresh[/insertion] air entering at the
 bottom of the lantern.-  This fact
is constant & is proved by the
simplest exp[superscript]t[/superscript].- -
In reflecting upon it & considering
that in the atmosphere [insertion]in mines[/insertion] becomes laden
with [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] fire damp it [insertion]greatly[/insertion] enlarges
the flame of a candle it appeared
to me obvious that by using in
the mines a close lantern fitted
only to [deletion]sup[/deletion] supply air to
the flame in its natural state
When hot air approaches to
the explosion point the flame
must become so much enlarged
[deletion]it[/deletion] as to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] consume rapidly
all the oxygene in the vessel
& consequently to produce the
extinction of the light; &
in making a trial with artificial

[page]76||dnp11050pp|95149072[/page]
20 50
atmospheres containing fire damp
I found that this was universally
the case .-.
I inclosed a taper in a small
close lantern having an aperture
above and below of such sizes
that the [deletion]can[/deletion] taper burnt
with a flame a little below
its natural size; - I placed
this lantern, the taper being lighted
[insertion]on a stand[/insertion] under a large glass receiver [insertion]standing in water[/insertion] having
a curved tube containing [insertion]a little[/insertion] water
adapted to its top to confine
the air; & which was of such
a capacity as to enable the
candle to burn for some minutes -
I then rapidly [deletion]passe[/deletion] threw a
quantity of fire damp into the

[page]77||dnp11051pp|95149073[/page]
21 51
into the receiver [insertion]from a bladder[/insertion] so as to make
the atmosphere in [deletion]the[/deletion] it explosive.
[deletion]- The flame in the lantern[/deletion]
As the fire damp mixed with
the air the flame of the taper
gradually enlarged till it half
filled the lantern it then [deletion]as[/deletion]
[deletion]di[/deletion] rapidly diminished & was suddenly
extinguished without the slightest
explosion.- I examined
[deletion]I tried the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] a second[/deletion]
[deletion]time throu[/deletion]
the air of the receiver
after this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] & found
it highly explosive.
- I tried similar exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
throwing in mixtures of air
& fire damp some containing
the maximum [insertion]& others the minimum[/insertion] of fire damp;

[page]78||dnp11052pp|95149074[/page]
52 22
necessary for explosion & always with
the same satisfactory results.-
- The flame considerably increased &
was soon extinguished:-
- I introduced the [deletion]la[/deletion] [insertion]lighted[/insertion] lantern
[deletion]the taper[/deletion] into an atmosphere
containing [deletion]the[/deletion] an explosive mixture
of [deletion]light hydrocarbonate[/deletion] [insertion]fire damp[/insertion] & air; the
air being to the hydrocarbonate
as about 12 to 1 in a large
jar opened in the atmosphere
it burnt at first with
a feeble light the flame
soon became enlarged &
[deletion]it[/deletion] was then extinguished. -
-. [deletion]In Attempting to repeat[/deletion]
[deletion]Having only a limited quantity[/deletion]
[deletion]of the fire damp I attempted[/deletion]
[deletion]to repeat these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with[/deletion]

[deletion]this gas or explosive mixtures of [/deletion]

[deletion]in one instance when I attempted[/deletion]
[deletion]to exp tried the exp[superscript]t[/superscript].[/deletion]

Very early in my enquiries on [insertion]the explosive powers of mixtures of air with fire damp[/insertion]  [deletion]the fire[/deletion]

& connected with the reservoir of explosive

the explosion [insertion]was[/insertion] never communicated
through the tubes provided there was
a current of air passed through them.
[deletion]& on this point; I could[/deletion] Thus when
[deletion]air[/deletion] [insertion]explosive mixtures[/insertion] were pressed from a bladder
into a vessel [deletion]excluded[/deletion] open by a
small aperture to the atmosphere; the
explosion made in the vessel never
communicated to the mixture in the
bladder. - And in this idea I [deletion]have[/deletion] had

[page]86||dnp11060pp|95149082[/page]
30 60
constructed the bellows lamp; in which
a very small bellows supplied air to a
close lamp connected with the atmosphere [deletion]only[/deletion]
by a tube containing a column of [deletion]water[/deletion] fluid
When an explosive mixture is pressed
through the bellows so as to reach the
flame it explodes [insertion]and extinguishes the light[/insertion] but neither communicates
[deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]the flame to[/insertion] the mixture in the bellows nor
to the atmosphere in the tube. -
- -. The first apparatus that I had constructed
when I [deletion]a[/deletion] supposed that the fire damp
would be equally explosive with other inflammable
gases was one still more complicated &
[deletion]a[/deletion] which I shall call the piston lamp
- in this the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] air was pressed by
a small piston [insertion]having two valves like that of a compressing apparatus apparatus[/insertion] into a close lamp furnished
like the bellows lamp with a tube above
& perfectly airtight; & in this apparatus
mixtures of even hydrogene [deletion]have[/deletion] I found
might be exploded without communicating
with the external air.
- But both the bellows lamp & the
piston lamp like the steel mill require
a person to work them; - & the necessity
of trying them in [deletion]the[/deletion] coal mines appears

to be done away [deletion]with[/deletion] by the property
which [insertion]so happily[/insertion] belongs to the fire
[underline]damp[/underline] on which the principle of
the safe [deletion]lamp[/deletion] [insertion]lantern[/insertion] is founded.
[deletion]By employing[/deletion] [insertion]When[/insertion] the safe lantern [insertion]is employed[/insertion] in [deletion]the[/deletion]
[underline]coal mines,[/underline] the extinction of the flame

retire & will shew the necessity of ventilating
that part of the mine. In this case
the only inconvenience is the extinction
of the light; [deletion]instead In[/deletion] With
a common light the loss of life
is almost inevitable.
Some persons have proposed to burn
the fire damp in the mine; but this will
only render the ventilation more difficult
for there will be less respirable air
in the residuum of the combustion
than in the mixed gas; & the ventilation
must be greater to free the mine from
the choke damp so generated than from the

It does not appear by what I

its explosive mixture . --
-: Miners sometimes are found alive in
a mine after an explosion has taken
place.- this is easily explained when
it is considered that the explosion
is almost always limited to a particular
spot & that it mixes the residual
air with much common air &
supposing 1 of fire damp to 1/13
of air [deletion]the least[/deletion] to be exploded; there will
still remain [insertion][deletion]nearly more than almost[/deletion][/insertion] nearly 1/3 of the original
quantity of oxygene in the residual
gas; A [insertion]in some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] made 16 years ago[/insertion] I found that an animal
lived though with suffering for a
short time in a gas containing 100 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
Azote. 14 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of carbonic acid & 7 p[superscript]ts[/superscript]  of
oxygene.-
It is a very remarkable & fortunate
circumstance that the [insertion]inflammable[/insertion] gas most commonly
[deletion]disengaged[/deletion] [insertion]produce[/insertion] in nature is the least inflammable

[page]92||dnp11066pp|95149088[/page]

of all the gaseous combustible gases & likewise
the least deleterious & and when it [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] explodes
mixed with common air its combustion
is less rapid than that of any other
gas. The miners probably are
generally killed during the explosion
of the fire damp from not closing
their mouth & nostrils & supposing
the safe lantern had not offered
so simple a mode of preventing
explosions it would [insertion]have[/insertion] been worth
while in cases of danger for
the miners to have worked
with an apparatus for closing
the nostrils. It has happened
that there has been time for
the miners to lay [deletion]themselves on[/deletion] [insertion]down on[/insertion]
the ground before an explosion
reached them; & of course the
precaution of closing the mouth -

adopted -
The fire damp appears to be constantly
found in coal mines, though in very different
quantities & the cause seems to be that
the coal strata formed under a pressure greater
than that of the atmosphere give off
elastic fluid when they are exposed to the
free atmosphere:- & probably coals containing
animal remains evolve not only
the fire damp but likewise Azote &
carbonic acid as in the instance
 of the gas sent by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Clanny -

[deletion]On a method of preventing[/deletion]

The accidents arising from the explosion of the fire damp or
inflammable gas of coal mines mixed with atmospherical air
are annually becoming more frequent and more [deletion]terrible[/deletion] [insertion]destructive[/insertion] in the col-
lieries in the North of England
A Committee has been for some time formed at Sunderland
for the benevolent purpose of investigating these acci-
dents and of searching for means of preventing them. - In conse
sequence of an invitation from the Rev[superscript]d[/superscript] D[superscript]r[/superscript] Gray one of the
most active members of this committee I was induced to turn
my attention to the subject. I went to the North of England and
visited some of the principal collieries in the neighbourhood of
Newcastle for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the
workings and their ventilation. - I found the greatest desire to assist
my enquiries in the Gentlemen acquainted with the state of
the Northern Collieries as well as the Inspectors or Viewers of the
mines and I have particular obligations on this point to Cuthbert
Ellison Esq[superscript]re[/superscript]. M.P. the Rev[superscript]d[/superscript] John Hodgson D[superscript]r[/superscript] Fenwick D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Clanny
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Buddle M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dunn & M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Fenwick
From the information which I collected on the spot increased
by the perusal of a report by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Buddle on the state of the

[page]98||dnp11072pp|95149094[/page]
2 72
mines I was convinced that as far as ventilation was concerned
the resources of modern science had been fully employed; and
that a mode of preventing accidents was only to be sought for
in a method of lighting the mines free from danger and
which by indicating the state of the air in the part of the mine
where inflammable air was disengaged so as to render the at-
mosphere explosive should oblige the miners [insertion]to retire[/insertion] till the workings
were properly cleared
An account of an ingenious apparatus for burning a candle
supplied with atmospherical air through water has been published
in the Philosophical Transactions by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Clanny but [insertion]I believe[/insertion] [deletion]all the In[/deletion]
[deletion]spectors of the mines with whom I conversed stated to me that its[/deletion] [insertion]this apparatus has not yet been used in any[/insertion]
[insertion][deletion]the[/deletion] of the collieries.[/insertion] [deletion]size and the necessity of manual labour in employing it had[/deletion]
[deletion]hitherto prevented them from adopting it in [underline]collieries[/underline][/deletion]
The common means employed for lighting those parts of the
mine where danger is apprehended from the fire damp is by
a steel wheel which being made to revolve in contact with
flint affords a succession of sparks but this apparatus requires a
person always to work it and though much less liable to explode
the fire damp than a common candle yet it is said to be
not entirely free from danger
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Buddle having obligingly shewn to me the degree of
light required for working the collieries I made several experiments
with the hope of producing such a degree of light without active

inflammation I tried Kunckel's Canton's & Baldwin's phosphorus
and likewise the electrical light in close vessels but without success
and even had these degrees of light been sufficient the processes
for obtaining them I found would be too complicated and
difficult for the miners
The fire damp has been [deletion]generally considered by Chemists[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]shewn[/deletion stated by  D[superscript]rs[/superscript] Thompson & Henry[/insertion]
[deletion]as the[/deletion] [insertion]to be[/insertion] light [deletion]hydro carbonate[/deletion] [insertion]carburetted hydrogene gas[/insertion] but I do not [insertion]believe any[/insertion] [deletion]know of any exact[/deletion]

procured [insertion]various[/insertion] specimens of the fire damp in its purest state and
made a number of experiments upon it: and in examining
its relations to combustion I was so fortunate as to discover
[deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion] propert[deletion]y[/deletion]ies [deletion] which [deletion]rendered it easy to adopt[/deletion] [insertion]appear to lead to very simple[/insertion] methods of
lighting the mines without danger to the miners; and which
I hope will supply the desideratum so long anxiously required
by humanity - I shall in the following pages have the
honor of describing these properties and [insertion]the[/insertion] methods founded
upon them to the Royal society; and I shall [deletion]preface them[/deletion]

coal mines during the common process of working
The Rev[superscript]d[/superscript]. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hodgson informed me that on pounding
some common newcastle coal in a cask furnished with a
small aperture the gas from the aperture was inflamma-
ble: and on breaking some large lumps of coal under water
I ascertained that they gave off inflammable gas*- Gas is
likewise disengaged from bituminous shist when it is worked
The great sources of the fire damp in mines are however
 [deletion]called blowers[/deletion] what are called blowers or fissures in the broken
strata near dykes from which currents of fire damp issue
in considerable quantity and sometimes for a long course of
years. When old workings are broken into likewise they are
often found filled with fire damp and the deeper the
mine in general the more common is this substance
I have analysed several specimens of the fire damp the
pure inflammable part was the same in all of them but
it was sometimes mixed with small quantities of atmospherical
air and in one instance with azote and carbonic acid
Of six specimens collected by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dunn from a blower in
the Hepburn colliery by emptying bottles of water close to it: The purest
contained 1/15 only of atmospherical air with no other contamination
and the most impure contained 5/12 of atmospherical air so that

doubt that it was pure fire damp. M[superscript]r[/superscript]. M. Faraday who
accompanied me and assisted me in my chemical experiments
in my journey collected some gas from a cavity in the earth
about a mile from Pietra Mala then filled with water &
which from the quantity of gas disengaged is called [underline]Acqua[/underline]
[underline]Buja[/underline] I analyzed it in the Grand Duke's laboratory at Florence
and found that it was pure light hydro carbonate requiring
2 Volumes of oxygene for its combustion and producing a volume
of carbonic acid
It is very probable that these gases are disengaged from
coal strata beneath the surface or from bituminous shist

may be opened to Tuscany from this invaluable mineral

this air was probably derived from the circumambient air of the mine
- The weight of the purest specimen was for 100 cubical inches 19.5 gr.
One measure of it required for its complete combustion by the
electric spark nearly 2 measures of oxygene and they formed
nearly one measure of carbonic acid.
Sulphur heated strongly; and repeatedly sublimed in a portion
of it freed from oxygene by phosphorus produced a considerable
enlargement of its volume sulphuretted hydrogene was formed
and charcoal precipitated and it was found that the volume
of the sulphuretted hydrogene produced when it was absorbed by
solution of potassa was exactly double that of the fire damp
decomposed.
It did not act upon chlorine in the cold but when an electri
cal spark was passed through a mixture of 1 part of it with
2 of chlorine there was an explosion with a diminution to less
than 1/4 and much charcoal was deposited
The analyses of specimens of gas sent to my friend John
George Children Esq[superscript]r[/superscript]. by D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Clanny afforded me similar results
[deletion]and tried[/deletion] [insertion]but they contained variable quantities of carbonic acid gas & azote. Different specimens of these gases were tried[/insertion] by the test of exposure to chlorine both in darkness &
light, they exhibited no marks of the presence of olefiant gas or

showed them to be free from carbonic oxide

the report produced by 50 cubical inches of this mixture
was less than that produced by 1/10 of the quantity of a
mixture of 2 parts of atmospherical air and 1 of hydrogen
It was very important to ascertain the degree of heat required
to explode the fire damp mixed in its proper proportion

fire damp And a fire made of well burned charcoal i.e.
charcoal that burned without flame was flown up to white-
ness by an explosive mixture containing the fire damp
without producing its inflammation - An iron bar at the
highest degree of red heat and at the common degree of white
heat did not inflame explosive mixtures of the fire damp
but when actually in brilliant combustion it produced the effect
The flame of gaseous oxide of carbon as well as olefiant
gas exploded the mixtures of the fire damp
In respect of combustibility, the fire damp differs most
materially from the other common inflammable gases. Olefiant
gas which I have found explodes mixed in the same propor-
tions with air, is fired by both charcoal and iron heated to
dull redness Gaseous oxide of carbon which explodes when
mixed with 2 parts of air is likewise inflammable by [insertion]red[/insertion] hot

with a bladder by a stopcock having an
aperture of about 1/6 of an inch, I found
that the flame passed into the Atmosphere,
but did not communicate through the
stop cock so as to inflame the mixture
in the bladder: And in comparing
the power of tubes of metal & those of glass
it appeared that the flame passed
more readily through glass tubes of the
same diameter: & that explosions
were stopped by metallic tubes of 1/5
of an inch when they were two inches
long & this phaenomenon seems to depend
upon the heat lost during the explosion
in contact with so great a cooling
surface which brings the temperature
of the first portions exploded below
that required for the firing of the other
portions. Metal is a better conductor
of heat than glass & it has been already
shewn that the fire damp requires a very
strong heat for its inflamation.

I mixed Azote & carbonic acid in
in different quantities with explosive
mixtures of fire damp; & I found
that even in very small proportions
they diminished the velocity
of the inflammation. Azote
when mixed in the proportion
of 1 to 6 of an explosive
mixture containing 12 of air
& 1 of fire damp deprived it

[page]113||dnp11085pp|95149109[/page]

of its power of explosion: when
1 p[superscript]t[/superscript] of Azote was mixed with
7 or an explosive mixture a feeble
blue flame merely [insertion]slowly[/insertion] passed through the mixture
1 p[superscript]t[/superscript] of carbonic acid to 7
of [deletion]an[/deletion] an explosive mixture deprived
it of the power of exploding
so that its effects are more
remarkable than those of Azote
probably in consequence of its
greater capacity for heat & [deletion]likewise[/deletion] probably
[deletion]of it[/deletion] likewise of [deletion]its[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] higher conducting
power connected with its greater density. -
- The consideration of these
various facts led me to adopt
a form of a lamp [insertion]in[/insertion] which the flame

of the fire damp; & which by

I tried several experiments on
the burning of a flame [deletion]in[/deletion]
the [deletion]burning of [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] lanterns[/deletion]
in [deletion]atmosph[/deletion] atmospheres containing
fire damp.
 I inclosed a taper in a [deletion]small[/deletion] [insertion]little[/insertion] close lantern having [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]small[/insertion] aper-
ture [deletion]above & below[/deletion] [insertion]below & a larger one above[/insertion] of such size that the taper burnt with a
flame a little below its natural size I placed this lantern the
taper being lighted on a stand under a large glass receiver
standing in water having a curved tube containing a little water
adapted to its top to confine the air and which was of such a
capacity as to enable the candle to burn for some minutes.
I then rapidly threw a quantity of fire damp into the receiver
from a bladder so as to make the atmosphere in it explosive
As the fire damp mixed with the air the flame of the taper
gradually enlarged so that it half filled the lantern it then
rapidly diminished and was suddenly extinguished without
the slightest explosion. I examined the air of the receiver after
this experiment and found it highly explosive.
I tried similar experiments throwing in mixtures of air
and fire damp some containing the maximum and
others the minimum of fire damp necessary for explosion
and always with the same satisfactory results. The flame

quantity of oil - [deletion]that[/deletion] if a [insertion][deletion]small[/deletion][/insertion] lighted taper
be introduced into the lantern, through
a small door in the side which is
[deletion]after[/deletion] instantly closed; both lights will
burn for a few seconds & be extinguished
together. NP . |_ A similar phaenomenon
occurs if in a close lantern
supplied with a quantity of air merely
sufficient to support a certain flame
a mixture of fire damp & air is gradually
admitted, the first effect of the fire
damp is to produce [insertion]larger[/insertion] flame round that
of the lamp; & this flame consuming
the oxygene which ought to be applied
to the power of the lamp & the standard
of the air for supporting flame being lowered
by the admixture of fire damp; both
the flame of the firedamp & that of the
taper were extinguished together & as the

[page]117||dnp11089pp|95149113[/page]

considerably increased and was soon extinguished.
I introduced the lighted lantern into an atmosphere
containing an explosive mixture of fire damp and air
the air being to the hydrocarbonate as about 12 to 1 in a
large jar opened in the atmosphere it burnt at first with
a feeble light the flame soon became enlarged and was then
extinguished. I repeated these experiments several times
and with a perfect constancy of result.
It is obvious then that to prevent explosions in coal
mines it is only necessary to use [deletion]close[/deletion] [insertion]air tight[/insertion] lanterns supplied
with air from [deletion]apertures [/deletion] [insertion]small[/insertion] tubes at some distance from the
flame and having a chimney at the upper part [insertion]or a similar arrangement of tubes[/insertion] for carry-

a larger or smaller wick is burned in it - An oil lamp
I think will be preferred to a candle because it will always
stand in the lantern at the same height and the flame
will be more regular and this lamp may be introduced
from the top of the lantern [deletion]and trimmed in the same[/deletion]

another small tube [insertion]for admitting air[/insertion] in the center of

It does not appear by what I have learnt from all the miners
that breathing an atmosphere containing a certain mixture
of fire damp * below the explosive point is attended with
any bad consequence .- I ascertained that a bird lived in a mix-
ture of equal parts of fire damp and air but he soon began to
shew symptoms of suffering I found a slight head ache produced
by breathing for a few minutes an explosive mixture of fire
damp and air and if merely the health of the miners be
considered the fire damp ought always to be kept far below the
point of its explosive mixture.
Miners sometimes are sometimes found alive in a mine after [deletion]its[/deletion]
an explosion has taken place this is easily explained when it
is considered that the explosion is almost always limited to a
particular spot and that it mixes the residual air with
much common air and supposing 1 of fire damp to 13 of
air to be exploded there will still remain nearly 1/3 of the
original quantity of oxygene in the residual gas and in
some experiments made 16 years ago I found that an
 animal lived though with suffering for a short time in a gas

[underline]Appendix[/underline] small print
I have had two other [insertion]close[/insertion] lanterns made which
may be called the fire valve lanterns.
In this the candle or lamp burns
with its full quantity of air, till
the air begins to be mixed
with fire damp when as the
fire damp increases the flame
a thermometrical spring at the top
of the lantern made of brass & steel soldered
together & in a curved form [insertion]expands[/insertion] moves
a valve which may be either at
the air hole or the chimney
diminishes the circulation of air
& extinguishes the flame.
The fire valve lanterns probably will never
be necessary in coal mines unless there
should be found instanced in which
olefiant gas gaseous oxide of Carbone
or hydrogene are disengaged. For though
gradual mixture of these substances
when I used a small lantern in which there was a perfectly

with air would extinguish the safe lantern yet certain explosive
mixtures of them might enter the lantern after this extinction
and in some cases be exploded by the wick for the true fire
damp is the only inflammable gas that is not fired by
ignited charcoal and therefore supposing an atmosphere to
be contaminated by olefiant gas gazeous oxide of carbon
hydrogene or sulphuretted hydrogene it would be necessary
that the flame should be extinguished before the mixture
of the gas had reached the explosive point
- In some experiments that I tried on the gas procured from the
distillation of coal I found it uniformly in all the stages of the
process explosive when mixed in certain proportions with atmos-
pheric air by ignited iron or charcoal and this was owing to the
olefiant gas mixed with the light hydrocarbonate in the first stage
and to the gazeous oxide of carbon and hydrogene mixed with it in
the last stage & by mixing from 1/4 to 1/8 of olefiant gas or gazeous
oxide of carbon with the fire damp of the coal mines I made
mixtures explosive by red hot iron or charcoal when common air
was added to them
But nevertheless I have several times extinguished the safe lamp by
throwing into it explosive mixtures of the gas from the distillation of
coal and air and I never had an explosion except in two cases
when I used a small lantern in which there was a perfectly

free circulation of air and in which the flame was nearer
than usual to the air apertures and in these instances the effect
appeared to be produced by the gas that entered after the extinction of the
flame and came in contact with the ignited wick a circum-
stance that can never occur with the true fire damp.
Very early in my enquiries on the explosive powers of mixtures of
air with fire damp [deletion]I found that when fire damp or the gas[/deletion]
[deletion]produced by the distillation of coals were made to explode in vessels[/deletion]

[deletion]atmosphere the explosion made in the vessel never communi-[/deletion]
[deletion]cated to the mixture in the bladder. And in this idea[/deletion]
[deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]I had[/insertion] constructed [insertion]a lantern which may be called[/insertion] the bellows [deletion]lamp[/deletion] [insertion]lantern[/deletion] in which a very small
bellows supplies air to a close lamp connected with the atmos
phere by a tube containing a column of fluid. When an
explosive mixture is pressed through the bellows so as to reach
the flame it explodes and extinguishes the light but neither
communicates the flame to the mixture in the bellows nor
to the atmosphere in the tube

that the fire damp would be equally explosive
with other inflammable gasses was one still
more complicated & which I shall call
the piston lamp. In this the air was
pressed by a small piston having two
valves like that of a compressing apparatus
into a close lantern furnished like the
bellows lamp with a tube above [deletion]& below[/deletion]
& perfectly air tight: & in this apparatus
mixtures of even Hydrogene & air may
be exploded without any danger of
communicating flame to the external
air: But both the bellows lamp
& the piston lamp like the steel mill
require a person to work them & the
necessity of trying them in coal
mines appear to be done away by
those properties of the fire damp
on which the safety lantern is founded.
Models of these lanterns & [underline]of the [/underline] fire valve
lamp are placed in the apparatus room of
The Royal Institution.-

- Some further [deletion]observations[/deletion] [insertion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
combustion of explosive mixtures [deletion]in[/deletion] confined
by wire gauze with some observations on
flame. by [underline]Sir H. Davy LLD FRS[/underline]
I have pursued my enquiries respecting
the limits of the size of the
apertures & of the wire in the
metallic gauze which I have
applied to secure the coal miner
from the explosions of fire damp. -
Gauze made of brass wire 1/50 of
an inch in thickness & containing
only ten apertures to the inch or
100 apertures in the square inch
employed in the usual way as a
guard of flame did not communicate
explosion in a mixture of 1 p[superscript]t[/superscript]

[page]156||dnp11128pp|95149152[/page]
2 128
of coal gas & 12 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of air as long
as it was cool but as soon
as the top became hot an
explosion took place.
A quick lateral motion likewise
enabled it communicate explosion
- Gauze made of the same wire
containing 14 apertures to the inch
or 196 to the square inch did
not communicate explosion till
it became strongly red hot when
it was no longer safe. [insertion]in explosive mixtures of coal gas[/insertion] but no
motion that could be [insertion]given[/insertion] [deletion]communicated[/deletion]
to it by shaking it in a
close jar [deletion]method[/deletion] produced explosion. -
Iron wire gauze of 1/40 & containing

[page]157||dnp11129pp|95149153[/page]
3
129
240 apertures in the square inch [deletion]appeared[/deletion] was
safe in explosive mixtures of coal gas
till it became strongly red hot
[deletion]when[/deletion] at the top.
Iron wire gauze of 1/50 & of 24 apertures
to the inch or of 656 [insertion]to the square inch[/insertion] appeared
safe under all circumstances
in explosive atmospheres
of coal gas: - I kept up
a continual flame in a cylinder
of this kind [deletion]8[/deletion] eight inches
high & two inches in diameter
for a quarter of any hour
varying the proportions of coal
gas & air as [deletion]much[/deletion] [insertion]far[/insertion] as [insertion]was compatible[/insertion] [deletion]possible[/deletion]
[insertion]with their inflammation[/insertion] the top of the cylinder [deletion]continued[/deletion]
for some minutes [insertion]was[/insertion] strongly red
hot; but though the mixed gas

[page]158||dnp11130pp|95149154[/page]
4 130
was passed rapidly through [deletion]the cylinder[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion]
[deletion]so as to[/deletion] [insertion]by pressure[/insertion] from a [deletion]large[/deletion] gazometer & a
[insertion]pair of double bellows[/insertion] so as to make it a species
of [deletion]wind furnace[/deletion] blast furnace
yet no explosion took place. -
I mentioned in my last communication
to the Society that a flame confined
in a cylinder of very fine wire gauze
did not [deletion]communicate[/deletion] explode
a mixture of oxygene & hydrogene
[deletion]which[/deletion] but that the gasses burnt
in it with great vivacity. - I
have repeated this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] in
nearly a pint of the most
explosive mixture of the two gasses;
they [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] burnt violently within the
cylinder; but though the upper part

[page]159||dnp11131pp|95149155[/page]
5
131
became nearly white hot yet no
explosion was communicated [deletion]but[/deletion] &
[deletion]so great was the heat that[/deletion] it
was necessary to withdraw the cylinder
to prevent the [insertion]bass wires[/insertion] from being melted. -
These [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] results are best
explained by considering the nature
of the flame of combustible bodies;
Which in all cases must be considered
as the combustion of an [underline]explosive mixture[/underline]
of inflammable gas or vapour [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] air:
for it can not be [deletion]considered[/deletion] [insertion]regarded[/insertion]  as a
mere combustion at the surface
of contact of the inflammable matter
& the [deletion]circumstance[/deletion] [insertion]fact[/insertion] is proved by holding
a taper or a piece of burning phosphorus
within [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a large[/insertion] flame [deletion]of spirits[/deletion] [insertion]made by[/insertion] the combustion

[page]160||dnp11132pp|95149156[/page]
6 132
of alkohol, the flame of the candle or of
the phosphorus [deletion]or of the c[/deletion] will appear
in the centre of the other flame
proving that there is oxygen even
in [insertion]its[/insertion] interior part: [deletion]of[/deletion] -
The heat communicated by flame
must depend upon its [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] mass
this is shewn by the fact that
[deletion]in a[/deletion] [insertion]the top of a[/insertion] slender cylinder of wire
gauze hardly ever becomes dull red
in the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on an explosive mixture
whilst in a larger cylinder made
of the same material the central
part of the top soon becomes
bright red. - A large quantity
of cold air [deletion]thrown[/deletion] thrown upon
a small flame lowers its heat

[page]161||dnp11133pp|95149157[/page]
7 133
beyond the explosive point: & in extinguishing
a flame by blowing upon it
the effect is probably principally
produced by this cause assisted
[deletion]probably[/deletion] by a dilution of the
explosive mixture. -
- If a piece of wire gauze sieve
is held over a flame of
a lamp or of coal gas, it prevents
the flame from passing it & the
phenomenon is precisely similar
to that exhibited by the wire
gauze cylinders; the air passing
through is [insertion]found[/insertion] very hot for it will
convert paper into charcoal, & it
is an explosive mixture for
it will inflame if a lighted
paper is presented to it; but it

[page]162||dnp11134pp|95149158[/page]
8 134
is cooled below the explosive point
by passing through wires even red
hot & by being mixed with a
considerable quantity of air
comparatively cold. - The real
temperature of visible flame is perhaps as
[deletion]the[/deletion] high[deletion]est[/deletion] [insertion]as any[/insertion] we are acquainted
with. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Tennant was in the
habit of shewing an exp[superscript]t[/superscript] which
demonstrates the intensity of its heat.
He used to fuse a small [deletion]close[/deletion]
filament of platinum in the flame
of a common candle & it is shewn
by many exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that a stream
of air [deletion]which wil[/deletion] [insertion]may be made to[/insertion] render a
metallic body white hot & yet
[deletion]not luminous[/deletion] not be itself luminous -
A considerable mass of heated metal[deletion]lic[/deletion]
[deletion]matter[/deletion] is required to inflame even coal
gas [insertion]or the contact of the same mixture with an extensive heated surface[/insertion] an iron wire of 1/20 of an inch

[page]163||dnp11135pp|95149159[/page]
135
9
red hot [deletion]did not produce this effect[/deletion]
when held horizontally over a stream
of coal gas [insertion]did not inflame it[/insertion] nor did a short
wire of 1/6 of an inch produce
the effect held in the same manner.
but the same wire [deletion]be of[/deletion] when
six inches of it were red hot
& when it was held perpendicularly
in a bottle containing an explosive
mixture to that heat was successively
communicated to portions of gas
produced the effect. -
A certain degree of mechanical force
which rapidly throws portions of
cold explosive mixture upon flame
prevents explosion at the point of
contact thus on pressing [insertion]an explosive mixture[/insertion] from
a syringe or a gum elastic bottle
[deletion]an explosive[/deletion] it burns only at
some distance from the aperture

[page]164||dnp11136pp|95149160[/page]
10 136
from which it is disengaged. -
Taking all these circumstances into
account there appears no
difficulty in explaining
the facts of the combustion
of explosive mixtures within
& not without the cylinders: for
a current is established from
below upwards & the hottest
part of the cylinder is where
the results of combustion the
water carbonic acid or azote
which are not inflammable
pass out; - the gas which
enters is not sufficiently
heated on the outside of the wire

[page]165||dnp11137pp|95149161[/page]
11
to be exploded; & as the gases
are no where confined there can be
no mechanical force pressing currents
of [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] air[/deletion] [insertion]flame[/insertion] towards the same point.
It will be needless to enter
into further illustrations of the theoretical
[insertion]part of the[/insertion] subject & I shall conclude
this paper by stating what I
am sure will be gratifying
to the society [insertion]that[/insertion] the cylinder
lamps have been tried in
two of the most dangerous
mines near Newcastle with
perfect success & [deletion]but there is[/deletion] [insertion]from the communications[/insertion]
I have had from the collieries there is
every reason to believe that
they will [deletion]be[/deletion] [insertion]be immediately[/insertion] adopted in all
the mines in [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] that neighbourhood
where there is any danger from [underline]fire[/underline] damp.

from fire damp & for giving light [deletion]by lanterns[/deletion]
in explosive [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] mixtures[/deletion] atmospheres
in coal mines by Sir H. Davy LL.D. VPRI
FRSL & E &c
The dreadful accidents of explosions which
occur in coal mines are occasioned
by the firing of light [deletion]hydrocarbon[/deletion]
carboretted inflammable gas which is
disengaged during the working of the
coals & from fissures in the
strata & which when it has accumulated
in any [deletion]part of[/deletion] [insertion]place in[/insertion] the mine so as
to form more than 1/13 p[superscript]t[/superscript] of
the volume of the atmospherical
air becomes explosive by a lighted
candle or by any kind of flame.

[page]176||dnp11148pp|95149172[/page]

|_ In parts of the mine where danger
is apprehended from the firedamp
the miners have [insertion]been[/insertion] accustomed to guide
themselves or to work by the
light afforded by the sparks of
steel struck off from a wheel
by flint, but even this opportunity
though much less dangerous than
a candle sometimes produces explosions
of the firedamp. -
A perfect security from [deletion]explosions[/deletion] accident
is however offered to the miner
in the use of a safe lamp
which transmit its light & is
fed with air through a cylinder
of wire gauze & this invention

[deletion]I have described to the Royal Society[/deletion]
[deletion]the experiments which led me to[/deletion]
[deletion]this discovery [insertion][deletion]the[/deletion] in a paper read to the that body I[/insertion] In the course[/deletion]
[deletion]have endeavoured to explain the principles of its operation[/deletion]
[deletion]of a laborious investigation[/deletion]
In the course of a long & laborious investigation
in the nature & communication
of [deletion]explosion[/deletion] [insertion]flame[/insertion] I ascertained that
explosions of gasses was incapable
of being passed through long narrow
metallic tubes & that [deletion]by diminishing[/deletion]
[deletion]the length[/deletion] this principle of security
was still obtained by diminishing their
length & diameter at the same time
[deletion]at by[/deletion] likewise diminishing their length
& increasing their number so
that a [insertion]great[/insertion] number of small apertures
apertures would not pass explosion
when their depth was equal to their

[page]178||dnp11150pp|95149174[/page]

diameter: - this fact led me
to trails upon sieves [deletion]foil of[/deletion] made
of wire gauze or metallic plates perforated
with numerous small holes; & I found 
that it was impossible to pass
explosions through them. I have detailed
[deletion]in[/deletion] the progress of these researches
& endeavored to explain the
principle of the operation
of flame sieves in some papers
read before the Royal Society. -
My object in this communication
is to offer some practical hints
to the proprietors & inspectors
of mines & to the miners
who may make use of the
lamp. -

increase the length & size of the flame.

A [underline]few [insertion]additional practical[/insertion] Onservations on the [insertion]wire gauze[/insertion] safety[/underline]
[underline]lamps for miners[/underline] with some evidence
of their use.
I have already published an account
of the researches which led me
to discover that explosions [insertion]& flame[/insertion] are incapable
of passing through [insertion]metallic[/insertion] tissues which are 
nevertheless very permeable to both
light & air & I have described several
contrivances for lighting [insertion]coal[/insertion] mines in
which inflammable air is disengaged
[deletion]found[/deletion] all founded upon the same
principle of security. -
- . The lamp which has been found
most convenient for the miners
is that [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]composed of[/insertion] a cylinder

[page]206||dnp11178pp|95149202[/page]
178
of [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] strong[/insertion] wire gauze fastened round the
flame by a screw & [insertion]in[/insertion] which the wick
is trimmed by a wire passing through
a safe aperture .-
[deletion]The[/deletion] Lamps [insertion]of this construction[/insertion] have been commonly
used in some of the most
dangerous mines in England for
nearly five months during which
time no accident has happened
& no inconvince occurred [deletion]as[/deletion]
[deletion]will appears from the testimonies[/deletion]
[deletion]of enlightened practical men[/deletion]
[deletion]attached to this paper[/deletion]
-. Since I first published the account
of the wire gauze safe lamp I
have made a number of
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] upon flame which have
led to some new philosophical

[page]207||dnp11179pp|95149203[/page]

179
views of this curious & important subject
[deletion]but I am able to add very little to[/deletion]
[deletion]what I have already done respecting[/deletion]
[deletion]the accounts of the lamp & which[/deletion]
[deletion]enable me to add some additional[/deletion]
[deletion][insertion]practical[/insertion] observations on in the absolute security[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]of[/deletion] the [insertion]use of[/insertion] safe lamps; In these pages[/deletion]
[deletion]I shall confine myself entirely to[/deletion]
[deletion]considerations which are of a practical[/deletion]
[deletion]kind. - but these I shall not[/deletion]
& to some practical results which I hope will
[deletion]at present discuss & shall limit[/deletion]
will be useful to the miner; these last
[deletion]myself to some practical observations[/deletion]
will form the subject of the following sentences
[deletion]which connected with them.[/deletion]
- I find that [deletion]as the use[/deletion] of double
cylinders of wire gauze so [deletion]fitted[/deletion] arranged
that the wires are parallel to
each other occasion very little loss
[deletion]diminuation[/deletion] of light; & very
much diminish the heat when

[page]208||dnp11180pp|95149204[/page]
180
the fire damp alone is burning within
the cylinder so that with double
cylinders I have never observed
the wire gauze to become red hot.
- The double cylinder lamp therefore
is preferable to the single one
whenever [deletion]it[/deletion] it necessary to
preserve a light for a long time
in an highly explosive atmosphere;
& it has likewise [deletion]double[/deletion] [insertion]twice[/insertion] the
strength of the single cylinder
lamp.
If objections which have been
made probably by persons who have
never seen the lamps, [insertion]against the weakness of the wire[/insertion] had really
been valid it would [deletion]have been[/deletion] be
easy to [deletion]have[/deletion] double the thickness
of it; or to have treble or

even quadruple folds of wire with
[deletion]por[/deletion] bars perfectly parallel; [insertion][unclear][deletion]xxxx[/deletion][/unclear] Layers of [/insertion] Wire gauze
for instance of 25, 26 & 27 apertures
to the square inch in the cylinder of
the common size when arranged with
a little care intercept very little
more light than a single layer.
-. I have had two lamps made
of [deletion]perforated plates[/deletion] [insertion]cylinders[/insertion] of copper
perforated with numerous such
apertures; but they are more expensive
[insertion][deletion]cylinders made of copper[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]than wire gauze[/deletion] [insertion]than cylinders made of copper wire gauze[/insertion] & not stronger

to give the same quantity of light.-

When ever a single wire lamp is made
to burn in [insertion]a very explosive atmosphere[/insertion] the heat [deletion]diminishes[/deletion] soon
arrives at its maximum & then diminishes

out, is shown to be unfounded

on this subject. [deletion]is fire[/deletion] I find
that a fusible compound [deletion]made easily[/deletion]
[deletion]made from[/deletion] of boracic acid & the earth
called Baryta answer[deletion]ed[/deletion]s the purpose
of a coating very well; [deletion]but I[/deletion]
[deletion]doubt whether such an application[/deletion]
[deletion]will ever be required[/deletion] & if
[deletion]such an application[/deletion] [insertion]in any cases experience should prove[/insertion]
that such an application is
necessary it may be easily made
.-. It is obvious that as long
as the principle of security
which is to admit no aperture
in a lamp of more than 1/20 of
an inch square is preserved

the construction may be almost
infinitely varied; & the firedamp 
may be found throughout the
whole of a cylinder or inflamed

had one lamp made of

the facility with which glass is broken
& horn & mica injured prevents
me from recommending any lamps

used [deletion]for[/deletion] the common purposes of the miner.

[deletion]On the acid[/deletion]
On [deletion]Nitromuriatic acid[/deletion] [insertion]Aqua Regia [deletion]the[/deletion] or Nitromuriatic acid[/insertion]
[underline]by Mr H Davy, [insertion]LLD[/insertion], VPRI FRS[/underline]
If strong nitrous acid saturated with
Nitrous gas [deletion]of 15[/deletion] be mixed with a saturated 
solution of muriatic acid gas in water,
[deletion]of the[/deletion] no other effect is produced than 
might be expected from the action of 
of Nitrous acid of the same strength
on an equal quantity of water &
the mixed acid so formed has no
power of action on gold & platina.
- Again if Muriatic acid gas & Nitrous
gas in equal [deletion]quantities[/deletion] [insertion]volumes[/insertion] be
mixed together over mercury & [deletion]a sulphurous[/deletion]
half a volume of oxygene be added

the immediate condensation will
be no more than might be
expected from the formation of
Nitrous acid gas :- [deletion]This is partly[/deletion] And
[insertion]when this is[/insertion] decomposed [deletion]& partly[/deletion] [insertion]or[/insertion] absorbed
by the mercury the muratic
acid gas is found unaltered
mixed with a certain portion
of Nitrous gas. -
It appears then that [underline]Nitrous[/underline]
acid & Muriatic acid gas have
no [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] chemical action on
each other. -
-: If [underline]Colourless Nitric acid[/underline] & muriatic
acid of [deletion]the[/deletion] commerce be mixed
together the mixture immediately becomes
[deletion]red[/deletion] yellow;& [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]gains[/insertion] the power of

dissolving gold & platinum
-. If it be gently heated
pure chlorine arises from
it & the colour becomes
deeper; if the heat be longer
continued chlorine [insertion]still[/insertion] rises but
mixed with Nitrous acid gas
which is much more absorbable
by water & which may be separated
from y[superscript]e[/superscript] chlorine by a such quantity
of water. When the [deletion]process has[/deletion] [insertion]process has been very[/insertion]

from it [insertion]it loses its power of acting upon gold & platinum[/insertion] & nothing rises from it
but a mixture of Nitrous acid
& muriatic acid. -
- It appears then from these observations
which have been very often repeated that

[deletion]Mixtures of Nitric[/deletion]
Nitro muriatic acid [deletion]is a mere mixture[/deletion]
[deletion]of Nitric & muriatic acid[/deletion]
owes its peculiar properties to a mutual
[deletion]the[/deletion] decomposition of [insertion]the[/insertion] Nitric &
muriatic acid; & that water chlorine
& Nitrous acid gas are the results. &
[deletion]& that[/deletion] the attractions which
[deletion]lead[/deletion] produce these results appear
to be the attraction of oxygene
for hydrogene to form water & that
of Nitrous acid gas for water;
[deletion]- It is easy to calculate the quantities[/deletion]
[deletion]in which these products must be[/deletion]
[deletion]evolved according to the doctrine of definite[/deletion]

[page]239||dnp11211pp|95149235[/page]

211
The correctness of these conclusions are
still further proved by the circumstance
that though Nitrous gas & Chlorine
have no action upon each other
when perfectly dry yet if water
is present there is an immediate
decomposition & Nitrous acid [deletion]gas[/deletion]
& muriatic acid are formed .-
- It is easy to calculate the [deletion]proportions[/deletion] [insertion]quantity[/insertion]
[deletion]in which[/deletion] of chlorine [deletion]is[/deletion] produced
in Nitromuriatic acid [deletion]are[/deletion] by
the doctrine of definite proportions.
- For for every 101 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] in weight
of Nitric acid [deletion]or for every[/deletion] [insertion]equivalent to[/insertion] 118 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] in
weight of hydronitric acid decomposed
67 p[superscript]ts[/superscript] of chlorine must be produced. -

-. The knowledge of the nature
of aqua regia will explain many
peculiarities of its action upon
metals & alkalies. - It does not
oxidate gold & platina but merely
causes their combination with
chlorine & when it [deletion]acts[/deletion]
produces neutral salts they
are mixtures: & not chemical
combinations of nitrates &
compounds of chlorine. -
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Berthollet with his usual
sagacity long ago [deletion]pointed[/deletion] stated
[deletion]out the true nature of[/deletion] that the
Nitromuriatic acid owed its peculiar

of chlorine*; & in substituting
the theory that it is a

of its being a compound

will be found in perfect harmony
with these I have drawn. -

[deletion]to me by her Grace the[/deletion] [insertion]which her Grace[/insertion]
[deletion]Duchess of Montrose who[/deletion]

from Tuscany.- It was
in a bottle carefully sealed
& full of water. Some

Faraday's analysis; that
the [deletion]water[/deletion] [insertion]menstruum[/insertion] which deposits
the [insertion]solid substance[/insertion] must be a solution
of silica in limewater
& heat is evidently the
agent by which the large
quantity of lime deposited
is made soluble [deletion]&[/deletion] is
enabled to act on silica
& the fact offers a new
point of analogy between
the alkalies & the
alkaline earths. -

low countries on the

Carbonic acid is disengaged
in considerable quantities
