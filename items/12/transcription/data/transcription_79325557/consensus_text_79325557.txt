Thou once wert fixed where in the midst of 
Heaven
The Giant mountain lifts his sovereign 
height
Above a hemisphere, Where in the sun beams
And the skies blue.
Where in the miday sun the unmelted
[deletion]snow[/deletion] ice
[unclear]Descends[/unclear] the blue etherial light of [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
The Arvi & the Arverin rolld the
waves
neath thee
And their troubled waters mixed 
Before the plains were peopled long before
The majesty of Nature was perceived
by mortal mind
Thy dwelling place was fixed amidst
the rocks
[deletion]Thou awful[/deletion]
Amidst the monuments of elder time
