The Eagle screamed below thee & the 
storm
Touched not thy habitation
The sounds
Ages past, [deletion]no human eye observed[/deletion]
[deletion]thee[/deletion]
Thine was a solitude awful sublime
Not visited by any forms of life
Therefore shalt thou be [deletion]to me a high[/deletion]
[deletion]memorial[/deletion]
To me a high memorial
destined to preserve
My mind from slumber, filled to awake
A spirit of high temper to the thoughts
That are not perishable; to the time of
Of passion [deletion]that delights in[/deletion] [insertion]breathing[/insertion] immortality
