And the memory [deletion]of days devo[/deletion]
Of Days devoted to the woods
 & streams
To quiet & to thought, devotions proud
To the eternal [unclear][deletion]xxxxxxx[/deletion][/unclear] [insertion]life[/insertion] of Heaven
In a high temple fixed amidst the rocks
[deletion]Oer arched[/deletion] Devotions raised
[deletion]Beneath the bright blue sky[/deletion]
And made [insertion]more reverential &[/insertion] more deep, by the wild
sound
Of mountain cataracts & brooks
