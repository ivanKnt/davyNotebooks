Thy powers are not yet exhausted little gem
Another tie shall bind me still to
thee
And other recollections, . sweeter still
For what are forms inanimate & dead
compared to those that live, Expressions light
Beaming from eyes that kindle with 
the glow
Of noble feelings carrying to the heart
A sympathy that [deletion]cannot[/deletion], will not cannot
die
The voice of wisdom & the voice of truth
