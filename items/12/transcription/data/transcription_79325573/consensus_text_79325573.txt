Fontainbleau Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] 29
[deletion]The sun majestic[/deletion]
The mists disperse & where a sullen cloud
Hung on the mountains verge, The sun 
bursts forth
In all its majesty of purple light.
- It is a winters evening: [deletion]yet the hue[/deletion]
& the year
Is [deletion]soon[/deletion] [insertion]fast[/insertion] departing; yet the hues of heaven
Are bright as in the summers
warmest month
It is the season of the sleep of 
things
But Nature in her sleep is lovely 
still
The trees display no [deletion]lustre[/deletion] [insertion]green [deletion]leaves[/deletion][/insertion] no forms of life
And yet a magic foliage cloathes
them [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]round[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]That glitters in the sun[/deletion]
The purest chrystals of pellucid ice
All purple in the sunset.
Amidst
