'Creations of the heaven;. [deletion]lovely in life[/deletion]
And the white snowstorms of the
clouds
Skirting the horizon tinged with golden hues
Below a deep dais purple
[Horizontal rule]
Such is the fitful change of human
things
An empire rises like a cloud in
heaven
Red in the morning sun [deletion]& glittering[/deletion]
spreading its
[deletion]golden[/deletion]
skirts
[deletion]Along the sky & filling the horizon[/deletion]
Of golden hues along the feverish 
sky
And filling the horizon
