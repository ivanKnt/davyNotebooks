To attempt to decompose Nitrogene by
the attraction of bodies that act upon
Hydrogene such as tellurium
[Horizontal rule]
According to guess there ought to be
6 proportions of Hydrogene & 1 of [deletion]Nitro[/deletion] Oxygene
6 of Hydrogene & 5 of oxygene, if 1 more
of oxygene should be given; then Nitric acid
would become water.-
[Horizontal rule]
In the view given of " [underline]Elementary principles[/underline] "
to begin with the ancient views & afterwards
to refer to Boylean principles
Perhaps the best arrangement will be
to class together the four gaseous bodies
not as yet decomposed -
May not gaseous oxide of Carbon
be decomposed into Hydrogene & oxygene
in these new and modern exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
