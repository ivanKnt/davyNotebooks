Mont Blanc. Jan' 5 1814.
4 oClock in the carrige
With joy I view thee, bathed in
purple light.
Whilst all around is dark.
With joy I see.
Thee rising from thy sea of pitchy 
clouds
Into the middle heaven
Though distant
far.
[deletion]Yet will I weigh thy majesty[/deletion]
As if a temple to the [deletion][insertion]The[/insertion][/deletion] etherial raises
[deletion]b[/deletion]By all the earth- framed of the pillar
[deletion]eternal rock[/deletion]
And canopied with everlasting snow.
