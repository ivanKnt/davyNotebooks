Its bright green waves & winding

The rocks, [deletion]br[/deletion]
Brown in their winters foliage
gained from the
Its flood of waters; And through 
a devious
course
- Though it has laved the fertile
plain & washed
The cities walls & mingled with
the streams
Of lowland origin - yet still preserves
Its native character of mountain 
strength
