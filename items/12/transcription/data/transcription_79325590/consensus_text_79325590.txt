Jan[superscript]y[/superscript] 6 1813.
Work of a mighty people, of a race
Whose monuments like those of Nature [deletion]stand[/deletion] [insertion]last[/insertion]
-With wonder I beheld [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the columns rise
[deletion]Your[/deletion] Their mighty arches raised in triple ranks
And not alone for use but in the form
Of perfect beauty & majestic strength
Firm on the marble rocks [deletion]on which[/deletion]
[deletion]they stand[/deletion]
on which they rest
The Roman mind in all its projects grasped
At Eternal empire, looked to no decay
And worked for generations yet unborn.
Hence was its power so lasting, Hence
So slow its changes, hence its monuments
