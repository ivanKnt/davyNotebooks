In the last Bakerian lecture I [insertion]have[/insertion] hazarded a conjecture whether
the [deletion]diamond[/deletion] difference between the diamond & common
carbonaceous substances may not be owing to the presence of
some light & subtle principle [insertion]in the diamond which may be[/insertion] [deletion]which is[/deletion] expelled from it by oxygene.
[deletion]I have lately been able to put the conjecture to the[/deletion]
[deletion]test of experiment & I have ascertained that it is not[/deletion]
[deletion]founded. I have likewise been able to make some[/deletion]
[deletion]researches[/deletion] An opportunity having lately occurred to me of
putting this conjecture to the test of experiment, I
have availed myself of it [deletion]I have availed myself[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] & I have made a number of experiments
on the combustion of the diamond & of other
carbonaceous substances.- Finding [deletion]that the[/deletion] no tendencies
of the truth of [insertion]the[/insertion] above mentioned conjecture, [deletion]I undertook a minute[/deletion]
[deletion]examinations of the [unclear]fluctuation[/unclear] of gas formed in the combustion[/deletion]
[deletion]of my experiments[/deletion] I have sought for other courses
