[deletion]The conjectures[/deletion]
Since it has been shewn [deletion] by the experiments of M.[/deletion] [insertion]various accurate experiments[/insertion]
[deletion][person_030]Lavoisier[/person_030], [unclear][person_068]Tennant[/person_068][/unclear] & [person_003]Allen[/person_003] & [person_015]Pepys[/person_015][/deletion] that the Diamond
& certain carbonaceous substances [deletion]produce nearly the same[/deletion]
[deletion]quantity of[/deletion] consume nearly the same quantity of oxygene
in combustion & produce a gas having the same
obvious qualities a number of [deletion]suppositions[/deletion] [insertion]conjectures[/insertion] have been
formed to explain the remarkable differences in [insertion]the[/insertion] visible
[deletion]of qualities[/deletion] [insertion]properties[/insertion] of these bodies by supposing some [deletion]chemical[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] minute [deletion]chemic[/deletion] difference in their chemical
composition. - These conjectures [insertion][unclear]h[/unclear][/insertion] are [deletion]well known[/deletion] [deletion]to[/deletion] &
[deletion]the. it will be unnecessary to dwell upon them[/deletion]
been often discussed it will [insertion]not[/insertion] be necessary therefore [deletion]briefly[/deletion] to
to [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]dwell upon[/insertion] them. . .M. M. Biot & Arrago from the
high refractive power of the diamond have supposed that
it may contain [deletion]oxyg[/deletion] Hydrogene. I ventured to [deletion]suppose[/deletion] [insertion]suggest[/insertion]
in my third Bakerian Lecture from the circumstance
of its non conducting power & from the action of
Potassium upon it that it m[deletion]ight[/deletion]ay contain a minute
proportion of oxygene & in my last Bakerian lecture
I have hazarded the idea that it may [deletion]contain[/deletion]
be the carbonaceous principle combined with some light
& subtile element that may be expelled from it by
oxygene. - M. Guyton de Morveau who conceived He
had proved by experiments 12 years ago that
common carbonaceous substances are oxides of Diamond; from
his last researches [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] still[/deletion] conducted in the same
manner as those of Mess. M.' Allen & Pepys
seems still inclined to adopt this opinion
