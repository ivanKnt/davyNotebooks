I have long [deletion]been desirous[/deletion] [insertion]had a desire[/insertion] of making some new experiments on
the [deletion]products of[/deletion] the combustion of the diamond & other carbonaceous
Substances & this desire [deletion]has been[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] increased by the new [insertion]lately ascertained[/insertion] facts [deletion]supposed[/deletion]
[deletion]afforded by the combinations of[/deletion] [insertion]with respect to[/insertion] iodine, which [deletion]gives an acid[/deletion] [insertion]by uniting to[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion]
Hydrogene [insertion]affords an acid[/insertion] so analogous to Muriatic acid that it was for
[deletion]quite[/deletion] some time confounded with that substance . . My objects [insertion]in these experiments[/insertion] were
to examine minutely whether any matter was separated from the
diamond [deletion]or carbonaceous substances[/deletion] during [insertion]its[/insertion] combustion & to
determine whether [deletion]in all its characters[/deletion] [insertion]the gases[/insertion] formed in this process
was precisely the same in [insertion]its minute[/insertion] chemical nature, [insertion]as[/insertion] that
formed in the combustion of common charcoal.

During a stay that I made at Florence in the
