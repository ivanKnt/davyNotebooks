of experiments [insertion][deletion]researches[/deletion][/insertion] on the combustion of the Diamond I was
honoured by the able assistance of the Count Bardi
the Director [deletion]of the Mus[/deletion][unclear]eum[/unclear] & [deletion]professor[/deletion] [insertion]Sign[superscript]r[/superscript][/insertion] Gazzari
the profess[superscript]r[/superscript] of Chemistry of the [insertion]Florentine[/insertion] Museum & in the last

of the college Sapienza at Rome.-
- In the very first [deletion]process[/deletion] [insertion]trials[/insertion] on the combustion of
the diamond I ascertained a [deletion]new[/deletion] circumstance
[deletion]which enabled me to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] adopt [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] a very[/deletion] [insertion]that I believe has not been noticed before[/insertion]
[deletion]simple apparatus & very easy methods[/deletion] of
[deletion]operating in my inquiries were after [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
namely that the diamond when strongly ignited
by the [insertion]great in[/insertion] lens in a [insertion]thin[/insertion] capsule of platina perforated
[insertion]with many[/insertion] orifices so as to admit a free circulation
of air continued to burn in oxygene give[superscript]*[/superscript] [deletion]with[/deletion]
[deletion]great brilliancy[/deletion] after being withdrawn from
the focus -.: The light it affords is steady
& of so brilliant a red as to be visible
in the brightest sunshine & the heat produced
is so great that in one experiment
in which three fragments of diamond weighing
only 1 grain 9/10 were burnt a fine wire of platina
used for attaching them to the [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]capsule[/insertion] was fused &
that some time after the diamond was
removed out of the focus.-
-The knowledge of this circumstance [deletion]enabled[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]afforded[/deletion] enabled[/insertion] me [deletion]to [unclear]meas[/unclear][/deletion]
to [deletion]adopt a[/deletion] [insertion]employ a[/insertion] very simple [deletion]method of chemistry[/deletion] apparatus
& mode of operations . in my [deletion]experiments [unclear]from[/unclear][/deletion] researches
& to complete in two or three minutes experiments
which have been supposed to require the presence
