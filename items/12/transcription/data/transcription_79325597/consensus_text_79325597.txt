globe before & after the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was brought to the

gas had remained -. And as during the short time
required for the combustion there was no sensible
change either in the thermometer or Barometer
no corrections for pressure or temperature were
considered necessary -. The change of volume
in the gas after the combustion was estimated
by means of a fine tube connected with a
stop cock adapted by a female screw to the
stop cock of the globe & the absorption was
judged of by the quantity of mercury that
that entered the tube. [insertion]which affords means [insertion]a measure[/insertion] so exact that [deletion][unclear]no[/unclear] change[/deletion] [insertion]an alteration[/insertion] however minute could be overlooked.[/insertion] As the [deletion]strength[/deletion] elastic
