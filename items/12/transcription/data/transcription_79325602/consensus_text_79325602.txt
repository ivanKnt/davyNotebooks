I made a sufficient quantity of it [deletion]from[/deletion] by pouring
lime water into the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] recipient 
containing the results of the first exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. -& after collecting
& drying it at the temperature of 212[superscript]o[/superscript] Fah[superscript]t[/superscript]
I introduced a quantity of it [deletion]over mercur[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]enveloped[/deletion] contained in[/insertion]
[insertion][deletion]a little[/deletion] some foil of platinum[/insertion] through mercury into a [deletion]little[/deletion] glass tube filled with
mercury & I treated in the same manner.an equal
quantity of [deletion]powder[/deletion] finely powdered [place_243]carrara marble[/place_243] & admitted
to there equal quantities of [deletion]mur[/deletion] solution of muriatic acid
- In this trial there was rather more elastic fluid disengaged
from the [place_243]Carrara marble[/place_243] than from the Carbonate of
lime from the diamond; but on examining the
foil of Platinum after the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] I found that a
Glue of the carbonate had not been acted upon. _
- I had tried two similar exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] substituting bibulous
paper [deletion]for[/deletion] [insertion]instead of[/insertion] the [deletion]foil[/deletion] metallic foil for enfolding the
[deletion]platin[/deletion] carbonates. _ The results were such as
to shew that both substances [deletion]contained[/deletion] [insertion]afforded[/insertion] the
same quantities of elastic fluid. _
I heated some of the carbonate from the diamond
in a tube which contained Potassium & passed the Potassium
through it in vapour._ There was ignition &
a substance of a dark black colour was formed
 - this substance was [deletion]worked on[/deletion] [insertion]acted on by[insertion] diluted muriatic
acid [insertion]when[/insertion] it left a fine black powder which burnt
like lamp black & when thrown into fused
nitre scintillated & disappeared in the same
manner as powdered charcoal._
