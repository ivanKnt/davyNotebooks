a thin chrystalized diamond weighing .93

[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] water. _ Some oxygene gas, the last
portion from the decomposition of
hyperoxymuriate of Potass[unclear]ia[/unclear], was thrown
into the globe so as to displace
the water below the level of the capsule.
The focus of the great lens was thrown
upon the capsule which with the diamond
was instantly rendered dry by it & the
diamond soon entered into combustion
& burnt as usual.- After the process
was finished, the carbonic acid was absorbed
