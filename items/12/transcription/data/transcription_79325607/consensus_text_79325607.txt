1814 .May 24. Returned to Rome this day After a very
interesting journey to Naples & Pestum. _ We left Rome. Saturday 12.
of May._ . . The first part of the Road was over Volcanic matters
till we reached the Pontine marshes. Where the Appenines burst
upon us in mountain greatness & beauty of form.- La Cava
the Alban Mount, the Lake of Nemi & the territory in the
neighborhood of [underline]Rome[/underline] is volcanic, the Tufa is a species of
[underline]Travertine[/underline], decomposed Basaltic Rocks or patzolana cemented
by calcareous cement from [underline]Water[/underline] impregnated with Carbonic
acid; The Appenines are all calcareous, stratified
their bases covered with Travertine.- Not far
from la Caserta. We met again the Volcanic district
which reaches to the feet of Vesuvius; but the
mountains on the other side the Bay of Naples are
calcareous _ & [deletion][unclear]xx[[/unclear]/deletion] all the mountains along the Coast to
Pestum are of the same kind . at the foot of these
mountains appear in many cases formations of
Travertine. From the waters descending from the Appenines
-one [place_705]river[/place_705] which we crossed by a Boat 4 miles from
Pestum was celebrated by the ancients for its petrifying
qualities - The plain in which Pestum stands. is
formed of travertine; A little lake or tarn near
the ancient gate with recent depositions I took some of
the water of this lake of which 4 cubical inches evaporated
left 4.9 grains.
- Pestum is a very interesting spot; the Ruins of the
3 [deletion]xx[/deletion] temples very magnificent._ . Here, Grecian art of the
elder time is seen very little impaired whilst the [underline]Roman[/underline]
city has passed away. - I suppose the columns are about
25 feet high in the temples of Neptune -the most ancient
Doric._ & all of travertine. a stone probably foraged
