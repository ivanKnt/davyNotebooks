-: There is very little chrystalized lava in the neighborhood
of Vesuvius but the ancient lava [deletion]is[/deletion] below the modern
contains a great variety of chrystalized substances
in one specimen in possession of Montecolli I saw basaltic
hornblende, sienite & Mica; or at least thin plates exactly
resembling mica._ These lavas likewise present distinct
chrystals of Hornblende & feld spar; & in summer
there is an immense mass of lava of this kind
if that can be called lava which has been
fused under great pressure & probably cooled out
of the contact of air.
The fumes which constantly rise from the crater of Vesuvius
are water probably the depositions from the air. & muriatic
acid vapour_. near the crater there is a strong smell
of sulphureous acid._ The yellow matter which might be
mistaken for sulphur is iron dissolved from the lava by
the muriatic acid gas & water. I saw no sulphur on any
part of the crater that I examined; [deletion]xx xx[/deletion] In the night we

& noise & amazing colums of smoke the light was
red like that of a common bonfire; the products
