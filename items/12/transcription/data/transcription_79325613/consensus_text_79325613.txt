Life seemed [insertion]to breathe[/insertion] in every thing
The gorgous spirit of the spring
The Start was from a Zephyrs wing.
Moistened by the balmy Dew
Which summer steals from spring
Wafting each instant odours new
Such as their gales of fragrance bring
[sketch possibly of the Alps or the Rhone]
