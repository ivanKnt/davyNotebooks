The mountains above were clear & bright
[deletion]I[/deletion]Empurpled by the evening light
Not a single cloud was seen in the sky
But the wind was turbulent & high -
And full it blew on the tyrene sea
[deletion]This[/deletion]Which rose in billowy majesty.
Which rose but not in the stormy hue
For its colour was brightest purest blue
Save where it foamed in crested pride
White in the snow in the glaciers side,
Though loud the wind & high the breeze
Murmuring amidst the odorous trees
Yet Philomel as if to prove
That louder was the voice of love
Threw through the wood her thrilling Song
[deletion]Ring[/deletion] Her minstrel music wild & strong
& gentle Doves in thicket nigh
Heaved scarcely audible their sigh
Life seemed in every thing to enter
The blades of maize the limes on the [deletion][unclear]pine[/unclear][/deletion]tree
The great [deletion]xxxx[/deletion] palm shook on the giant pine
Seemed stirred by an impulse of power [insertion]divine[/insertion]
divine
