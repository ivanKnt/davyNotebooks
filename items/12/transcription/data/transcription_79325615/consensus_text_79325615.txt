The air is soft as in the month of june
In northern climes, a balmy zepher [insertion]blows.[/insertion]
And nothing speaks of winters harshest [insertion]month[/insertion]
Save that the trees are leafless
And yon [place_247]alps[/place_247] [deletion]encased in snows.[/deletion]
[deletion]Capped in the snow[/deletion] &
[deletion]girt around with[/deletion] ice
Not as in summer merely capped by [insertion]snows[/insertion]
But deep encased & girt around by ice
