through membranes themselves conducting - acts
by induction through water . . low single plates
seem electrical which distinguishes the torpedo from
the electrical column but this I am not sure
of . . the decomposition of water not occasioned
by the torpedo in some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] I made. June 5
at Rimini on a torpedo caught in the adriatic
used sulphuric acid as well as Sol: of Potassa.
- When at Milan towards the end of June
I [deletion]tried[/deletion] an exp[superscript]t[/superscript] with Volta to endeavor to
illustrate the action of the torpedinal organ.
- We found a pile very weakly charged decomposed by [person_150][unclear]Wollaston[/unclear][/person_150]
[insertion]apparatus[/insertion], water, but did not decompose muriate of
lime hence it appeared to offer an explanation
of the torpedo. of which cannot be passed through
water because it does not chuse to pass it.
through so bad a conductor; but which in passing
through a better conductor goes so rapidly as not
to occasion the polar decomposition; but at Geneva
Augt 14. I found his exp[superscript]t[/superscript] not correct; for
a pile as weak as Voltas though it would not shew
y[superscript]e[/superscript] decomposition of sulphuric acid on acct of sulphureous
acid; yet decomposed Sat. Sol. of Potassa with more
energy than a common water - Hence probably the sol:
muriate of lime evolved Chlorine in our exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] which
as the bulk was much absorbed Hydrogne. yet this
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] with the Muriate ought to be tried again
