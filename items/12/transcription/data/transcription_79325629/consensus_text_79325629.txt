Their [deletion]monuments are passed away[/deletion] [insertion]battlements are sapped by time[/insertion]
The pomp of mighty war is gone
[deletion]Amidst destruction & decay[/deletion]
& Our peaceful temples stand alone
Above their ruined towers, sublime

& lost in past eternity
Yet the history of the dead
May in the present scene be read
Graven upon those mighty stones
That press a peoples mouldering bones
Who once were happy blessed & free
Greeks [insertion]worthy[/insertion] vestry of our liberty
