85
unbroken on the shore
the shore
Roman slave
Free as the wave untouched by shore
Its certain [unclear][deletion]xxxxx[/deletion][/unclear] course
Strong & sad [unclear][deletion]xxxx &[/deletion][/unclear] rushed away
Not not in vesture & with roses crowned
But in dark garments fit for grief [insertion]profound[/insertion]
And [unclear][deletion]xxxxx[/deletion][/unclear] height with funeral cypress bound
And one the mournful crowd among
Uttered this melancholy song
