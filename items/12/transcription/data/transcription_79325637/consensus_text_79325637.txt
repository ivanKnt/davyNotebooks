Made a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the actions of Iodine
on the compounds of Phosphor[superscript]s[/superscript] & Sulp[superscript]r[/superscript] with chlorine
_ Some results will worthy of notice. _
1[superscript][underline]st[/underline][/superscript] It is probable as I formerly suspected that there
is a gaseous compound of Chlorine & Phosphorus
3 of C. & 1 of Phosphorus, & This [deletion]dissolves[/deletion] [insertion]unites to[/insertion] iodine
in enormous quantities & seems to form with it
an highly volatile [underline]triple compound[/underline] of a deep
orange colour & which gives an orange gas __
- [underline]Sulphurane[/underline] dissolves iodine & gives a purple
liquor which yeilds a purple vapour, & which
when acted on by water yeilds Sulp[superscript]c[/superscript] acid (probably)
& a whitish substance which seems to be a
compound of sulphur & iodine, from which iodine
rose when it was heated & that in considerable
quantities.
- The Sublimate Phosphoran[unclear]ce[/unclear]. became yellow
by the action of Iodine . but had not that
striking effect upon it. which Phosphorane had
& the solution of Phosphorus in Phosphorane
- When [deletion]the[/deletion] water was added to the fluid
compound of Phosphorus saturated with chlorine
& iodine the fluid [deletion]became[/deletion] dissolved in it
& became deep orange & a brown powder
was precipitated which was afterwards redissolved.
- .All these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] worth further pursuit
Mem[superscript]m[/superscript]. to discover the name of [person_588]Gazzaris[/person_588]
