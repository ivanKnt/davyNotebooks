Continuation of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on colour found at
the Baths of Titus. Rose colors effervesced with
acid; but did not lose colour till boiled
with strong acid. - did not lose its colour
by alkaline lixivia Pot.& Ammon: till heated
colour instantly destroyed by heat with
Borax gave a [insertion]slight[/insertion] tint of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] purple
did not scintillate with Nitre nor
smell of animal nor vegetable when
burnt. [deletion]did[/deletion] but these last trials
not conclusive -. treated in a glass tube
gave no sublimate - when the chalk
was washed out from it left a deeper
lake; I am inclined to think it
vegetable or animal. -
