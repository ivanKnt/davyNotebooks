In colour was brightest purest blue
save where on the rock
the foam rose high on its
[deletion]breast[/deletion]
White as the snow on the glorious breast
When faintly gleamed the evening star
I saw thy temples from afar
[deletion]Thou city of the nameless race[/deletion]
Raising their marble colours bright
In the last gleam of purple light
Above the wild deserted plain
Where death & silence seemed to reign.
[deletion]What contrast - on the cultured hill[/deletion]
[deletion]Around the olive the vine its chaplet[/deletion]
spread
