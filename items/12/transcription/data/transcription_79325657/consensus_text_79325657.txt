of the same kind as the blue which is evidently smalt.--
With potash the green colour makes a green glass with a precipitate of yellowish
matter, the green is not soluble in Nitric or muriatic acid
but with potash acts like a mixture of smalt with
some unknown matter. When [deletion]acted on by mur[/deletion] dissolved in potash

a yellowish green colour like oxide of copper.

oxide of copper formed by Nitric acid gave with Potash
a blueish glass. - smalt gave a brown glass fused

the green colour freed from chalk gave
