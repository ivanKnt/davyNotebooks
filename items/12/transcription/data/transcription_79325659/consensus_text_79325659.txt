A Red colour [deletion]obtained[/deletion] scraped from a piece of the wall of the Baths of Nero was
not altered by nitric or muriatic it contained combustible matter and
when burnt gave off sulphurous gas & tarnished the platina the flame was
blue When distilled yeilds a blackish fusible substance with a smell of sulphur-
etted hydrogen & leaves ashes which when acted on by nitrous acid affords
sulphuretted hydrogen
The orange colour when boiled with sulphuric nitric or muriatic acid[deletion]s[/deletion]
gave the same phenomena as minium mixed with calcareous matter

The blue colours [deletion]gives off a certain quantity of[/deletion] [insertion]does not seem to give[/insertion] copper [insertion]but only carbonat of lime[/insertion] to muriatic acid &
afterwards there remains a bright blue colour which is not altered by
the acids or by heat This substance fuzed with potash renders it first
green then brown and a substance like yellow oxide of Copper seems to
separate_ This blue residue powder was not acted sensibly
on by boiling sulphuric acid_-
Sol Ammon poured on the [deletion]co[/deletion] compound of it
with Potash became blue --
Smalt fuzed with potash first became blue & then green and gave a yellow
not blue colour to ammonia
Ammonia does not act on the blue powder.
The fine bright blue colour became darker by heat. by a still stronger
heat it agglutinated and gave a green colour to the flame when long urged
by the blowpipe it did not fuze into a glass but became a sort of frit
of a brown colour.
The combination of it with potash when acted on by nitrous acid
leaves a considerable quantity of silicious earth and [deletion]afte[/deletion] the nitrous solution
