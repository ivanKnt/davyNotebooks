-- .To begin with this - as the text. - a water saturated with
Carbonic acid - [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] & containing sulphretted Hydrogene - depositing
travertine & forming in consequence of the rapid decompositions
of Carbonic acid by vegetables & their decay [underline]floating island.[/underline]
-deposition of [underline]sulphur[/underline] . - a colour of this water -
Tivoli - river - [underline]anio[/underline] travertine of Tivoli _ Travertine

Probability that the great abundance of carbonic
acid produced by the action of subterranean Heat
on [underline]limestone[/underline]. or dependent on some change
in which that Rock is concerned. --- temperature
of the lacus [underline]Albunea[/underline] is it hot to ascertain
with precision._ That the cause which
produced the Volcanic matter is still active
