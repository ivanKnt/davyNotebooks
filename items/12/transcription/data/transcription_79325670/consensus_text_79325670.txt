{By assuming certain molecules endowed with poles

 has done. & giving them gravitation & form. ie

chemistry may be accounted for they will form spherical
masses when their attractions balance the repulsions
& fluids or aeriform substances
& chemical combination will depend upon particles

So that their spheres of attraction may coincide; but
we may suppose inherent powers (thus we suppose
