Our artificial Science has relations to the [underline]forms of Nature[/underline]; but yet
that which is most important in Nature [underline]life[/underline] is above our [underline]Science[/underline]
The astronomer vainly asserts the perfection of his Science
because He is capable of determining the motions
of 7 planets & 22 satellites; that comets &
meteoric Bodies which even move in our system
are above his reach & even this Solar system
is a speck in the immensity of space.
& Suns & worlds are beyond our reach.
. Our Science refers to the globe only & in
this there is an endless field for investigation
the interior is unknown the causes of Volcanoes.
We have just learnt some truths with respect
to the surface; but there is an immensity [deletion]of[/deletion]
beneath us _ [deletion]the [unclear]xxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] Geology in every
sense of the word[deletion]ld[/deletion] is a superficial service
