[deletion]the hope of determining the cause of[/deletion]
When I first discovered that these compounds
[deletion]Was[/deletion] in a state of [deletion]p[/deletion]Purity dissolved in
acids without effervescence, I [deletion]concluded[/deletion]
thought it probably that the effect
depended upon the formation of
a compound of oxygene & iodine similar
to Euchlorine, or the oxychloric acid
& which remained dissolved in the [deletion]liquor[/deletion]
fluid; & on this idea I made
a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with the hope
of obtaining such a combination in
a detached form.__
I distilled the solution of the
triple compound [insertion]of Potassium[/insertion] sol Sulphuric acid
but the only gaseous product[deletion]s[/deletion] I obtained
was oxygen [deletion]&[/deletion] sulphuric acid & iodine
condensed in the cool part of the
apparatus & the residuum was
acid sulphate of Potassa.--

iodine might nevertheless exist [insertion]in the fluid[/insertion] & the
 decomposable at [deletion]40[/deletion] [insertion]a [deletion]the[/deletion] high[/insertion] temperature [deletion][unclear]at[/unclear][/deletion]

to obtain it by [deletion]dripping sulphuric[/deletion] [insertion]acting[/insertion]
