often because M. Gay Lussac has stated
that an [deletion]peculiar[/deletion] acid compound of
oxygene & iodine may be procured
by dropping sulphuric acid into a solution
of the triple compound of [deletion]iodine[/deletion] Barium;
but his conclusions seem to have been founded
upon the want of effervescence in the process
& his experiments were made at a very early
period of the investigation & immediately after
I had discovered the triple compounds. & before
I had obtained them in a state of purity
- It [underline]is possible[/underline] that a binary compound
of iodine & oxygene may exist in the
solutions of the triple compounds in
acids yet there are [deletion]some[/deletion] circumstances
opposed to the idea, From the analogy between
[deletion]of[/deletion] chlorine & iodine it might have
been expected that [deletion]such a[/deletion] [insertion]such[/insertion] compound would
be coloured & would [insertion]ultimately[/insertion] destroy vegetable colour
but the solutions of the triple compounds in
acids are always free from colour
& do not act upon blue solutions of
indigo unless they are decomposed by
heat So as to evolve iodine_
Where small quantities of very diluted
sulphuric acid are digested on the
triple compounds of Potassium & Barium
