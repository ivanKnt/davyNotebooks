the fluid obtained is always acid & always
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] precipitates muriate of Baryta
- I thought it possible that the compound
of iodine & oxygene might possess this
property [deletion]as [insertion]it belongs to[/insertion] the oxychloric acid[/deletion]
but on collecting the precipitate
& examining it it had the character
of sulphate of Baryta, - & from
all the facts it appears that
in the action of acids upon the
triple compound[deletion]s[/deletion] new combinations
only were formed.
I take the liberty of proposing for
the triple compounds the names of oxyiodes
because when decomposed by heat they afford
oxygene & iodine. Individually they
may be named from their bases_ Thus
oxypotassame or oxyiode of Potassium
will signify the triple compound
of Potassium oxygene & iodine, &
oxybarame or oxyiode of Barium
will denote the triple compound
of Barium.___
