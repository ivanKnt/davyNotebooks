mixture & heating it to redness a
substance is formed exactly similar
to that formed by the combination
of the substance with Potassium._
-: As Potassa is a compound of
Potassa & oxygene; it is evident that
to form a compound of Potass[deletion]a[/deletion]ium &
the substance from Potassa, oxygene
must be expelled, & I found by experiment
that this was the case & in
investigating minutely the action of
fixed alkaline [deletion]sol[/deletion] solutions on the
substance I ascertained the existence
of a class of substances .precisely
similar to the hyperoxymuriates
consisting of oxygene, the substance
& potassium, & formed in [deletion]the[/deletion] a
manner exactly analogous.
- If the substance is thrown into
a moderately strong solution of Potassa,
as it dissolves chrystals fall down [deletion]which[/deletion]
[deletion]by[/deletion] & by saturating the solution with the
substance considerable quantities are obtained
by pouring off the mother liquor- & evaporating
it [deletion]to[/deletion] a little more chrystals fall
down._
