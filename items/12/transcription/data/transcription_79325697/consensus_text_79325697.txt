of the gas by distilling it with a new quantity of the substance
nor more gas from the fusible compound by distilling it with
a new quantity of phosphorus
When the fusible [insertion]compound of the[/insertion] substance [insertion]with Phosphorus[/insertion] is distilled with a small quan-
tity of water the gas produced seems to be of the same kind
as that produced by the action of heat [deletion]on[/deletion] [insertion]during[/insertion] the com[deletion][unclear]pressed[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]bination[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion]
[deletion]phosphorus and the substance[/deletion], and both these gasses ab-
sorbed by water afforded when acted on by nitrate of sil-
ver the same product as that formed by the action of a so-
lution of the substance in water on the same salt
I attempted to form a compound of the substance with
hydrogen directly by heating it in several experiments to
redness in glass tubes filled with hydrogen. When the gas
was moist or when the [deletion]fluid[/deletion] [insertion]tube[/insertion] contained vapour a strong
acid fluid was formed of a yellow colour._ When the gas &
the substance were dry there was an expansion of volume
and on breaking the tube, fumes appeared similar to those
produced by the action of the gas formed during the union
of phosphorus with the substance and which precipitated
in the same manner a solution of (nitrate of) silver
I have however never been able to destroy the whole quantity
of hydrogen employed in this experiment and at the highest
temperatures which can be applied to glass the action of the
hydrogen on the substance is very slow and cannot be com-
pared to its action on chlorine or oxygene._
