when the difficultly soluble substance is acted on by a small
quantity of water and heated in a glass tube much gas
spontaneously inflammable is disengaged and a white
sublimate rises which when acted on by cold water [insertion]becomes hot &[/insertion] af-
fords a considerable quantity of a gas having all the proper-
ties of hydro-phosphoric [deletion]acid[/deletion] [chemical_435]gas.[/chemical_435]
The solution of this [insertion]chrystal[/insertion] substance in water neutralized by
Potassa and decomposed by sulphuric acid afforded the
peculiar substance[deletion]s[/deletion] but when the solution was heated
strongly [insertion]before its neutralization[/insertion] it left only hydro-phosphorus acid which when
heated gave off hydrophoric gas and became phosphoric
acid
It is easy to explain all these phenomena except the pro-
duction of the acid gas which [deletion]appears[/deletion] [insertion]seems[/insertion] to be a compound
of the peculiar substance and hydrogene To account for
the appearance of this body is necessary to suppose the exist-
ance of hydrogene or of water in the substance or of hydro-
gene in phosphorus
I used the substance distilled through quick lime
which there is every reason to believe would absorb
all the water united to it but still the acid gas which
gave [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx xx[/unclear] because of[/deletion] hydrogene when decomposed
by mercury was produced._ I am inclined to attri-
bute the phenomenon to the action of hydrogen, con-
tained in the phosphorus and former experiments-
that I have made on phosphorus by voltaic electricity
prove the existence of hydrogene in this substance._ The
quantity of acid gas produced likewise is always small &
limited and I have never been able to produce from the
fixed compound of the substance with phosphorus more of
