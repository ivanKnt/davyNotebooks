producing heat without light, small quantities of a strongly
acid gas generally arise from the mixture, and by the ap-
plication of heat it is produced in greater quantities. When
the substance is in excess an easily fusible and volatile com-
pound of a red colour is obtained. When the phosphorus
is in excess the greater part of the product is more fixed._
I examined the gaseous acid formed by the action of
phosphorus on the substance with attention . it gives
dense white fumes by combining with the aqueous
vapours in the air. It has a smell very [deletion]analogous[/deletion] [insertion]similar[/insertion] to
that of the solid compound of chlorine and phospho-
rus [insertion]which itself is very analogous to that of Muriatic acid. _[/insertion] It is rapidly absorbed by water When made to act
upon ammonia it forms with it a dense white salt which
when acted on by sulphuric acid affords the peculiar sub-
stance and at the same time a smell of hydrogene is
perceived. When mercury is heated in it the same com-
pound as that produced by the action of the new substance
directly upon mercury is formed and hydrogen is disen-
gaged. When Potassium is made to act upon it there is no
inflammation as in muriatic acid gas but the potassium
becomes converted into a body similar to that produced by
its combustion in the vapour of the substance and a gas
which burns in the same manner as hydrogene is disen-
gaged._
When the easily fusible and volatile compound of the
substance with phosphorus is heated in water it rapidly
dissolves in it and forms a strong acid which when eva-
porated leaves [insertion]hydrophosphorous[/insertion] acid and which before its evapora-
tion neutralized by potassa and acted on by sulphuric acid
affords the peculiar substance
