The acid formed by the solution of the substance united to
chlorine reddened vegetable blues by its immediate contact
and soon after destroyed them
When [insertion]the new substance was[/insertion] heated in oxygen or brought in contact with red hot
hyperoxymuriate of potassa it seemed to undergo no
change.
M. M. Desormes & Clement had stated that when the sub-
stance was combined with the metals metallic oxides could
be obtained from the solutions, I suspected that this de-
pended upon the presence of moisture or upon
oxygen derived from the air and experiment justi-
fyed my suspicion
I heated the substance with Iron Mercury Tin Zinc &
Lead out of the contact of air it united to them without
any violence of action and formed compounds fusible at
a moderate heat and volatile at a higher temperature
All the compounds except that of zinc which was white
were coloured of different shades of red brown, red & orange
The compound it formed with tin was of a deep orange
that with iron of a brightened brown that with lead a bright
orange that with mercury an orange still more ap-
proaching to red
The compounds of Iron & Tin when exposed to an al-
kaline solution immediately deposited metallic oxides
but when I heated them in small retorts containing
pure ammonia no such change occurred and they
combined with the ammonia and formed com-
pounds which volatilized without leaving any oxides
When the substance is made to act upon phosphorus
they [insertion]two bodies[/insertion] combine with great rapidity at common temperatures,
