substance formed in all its obvious sensible and chemical qualities
the same as that obtained from solutions of the substance by ni-
trate of silver
The modes which occurred to me as most likely to effect [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] de-
composition [insertion]of the substance.[/insertion] by chemical agents were the action of the highly in-
flammable metals upon it which unite to oxygen and chlorine
or the action of chlorine which in general tends to the expulsion
of oxygen and to the separation of inflammable bases from
that principle
I heated some potassium in a little glass tube and passed
some of the substance in vapour through it [insertion]at[/insertion] the moment the
vapour came in contact with the potassium there was an in-
flammation and the potassium burnt slowly with a pale blue
light There was no gas disengaged when the experiment
was repeated in communication with a mercurial appa-
ratus
The substance formed by the action of potassium was white
fusible at a red heat and soluble in water_ It had a peculiar
acrid taste; when acted upon by sulphuric acid it effervesced.-
 & the peculiar substance appeared. [deletion] and there was a sensible [deletion][unclear]xxxx[unclear][/deletion]green-[/deletion]
[deletion]dry gas. [insertion]similar to that of muriatic acid._[/insertion][/deletion]
It was evident that in this experiment there had been no
decomposition of the body [deletion]and that[/deletion] the result [insertion]seemed to[/insertion] depend[deletion]ed[/deletion]
merely upon the combination of it with the potassium.-
I exposed the body to the action of chlorine in a small glass
tube, it absorbed the chlorine and a substance formed which was
volatile by heat and which appeared as a yellow solid. It was
soluble in water and rendered the water of a yellow green co-
lour and strongly acid; the solution when acted upon by solution
of potassa in excess effervesced and afforded the peculiar substance,
