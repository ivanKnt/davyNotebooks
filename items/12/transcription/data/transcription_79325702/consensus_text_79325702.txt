to lay before the Royal Society an account of the investigations I have
made upon it; and I do this with the less scruple as my peculiar
manner of viewing the phenomena have led me to some new re-
sults which probably will not be considered by the society as with-
out interest in their [deletion]general application[/deletion] [insertion]relation[/insertion] to the general theory of
chemistry & in their possible application to one of the useful arts._
The first experiments [insertion]that[/insertion] I made upon this substance were to as-
 certain, whether [insertion](argentane)[/insertion] muriate of silver could be formed from its so-
lution in water or alcohol, and for this purpose it was purified
by distilling it from lime.. Its solutions I found when mixed
with nitrate of silver deposited a dense precipitate of a pale
lemon colour; This precipitate when collected and examined
proved to be fusible at a low red heat and then became of a
red colour._ When acted upon by fuzed hydrat of potash it
was rapidly decomposed and [insertion]a[/insertion] solid [deletion]matter[/deletion] [insertion]substanc[/insertion] having all the cha-
racters of oxide of silver was formed.. the matter soluble in water
separated by a filter and acted upon by sulphuric acid afforded
the peculiar substance
A solution of potassa after being boiled on the precipitate af-
forded the [deletion]same[/deletion] [insertion]peculiar[/insertion] substance when treated by the same acid.
The precipitate was much more rapidly altered by exposure
to light than the muriate of silver and was evidently quite a
distinct body. [ Conceiving from the action of potassa upon it that
it must be a compound of the peculiar substance and silver
I endeavoured to form it directly by the combination of the two
bodies._ I introduced some of the substance into the closed end of
a small glass curved tube and placed in the upper part of it
some silver foil; I heated the foil nearly to redness and then
passed the substance [deletion]through[/deletion] [insertion]over[/insertion] it in vapour; there was an immedi-
ate action the silver was rapidly dissolved, and a red fusible sub-
