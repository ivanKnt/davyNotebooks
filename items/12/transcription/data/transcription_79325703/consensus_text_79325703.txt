oxides; that it forms a detonating compound with ammonia that
it is soluble in alcohol and much more soluble in ether and that
by its action upon phosphorus and [insertion]upon[/insertion] hydrogene a substance having
the characters of Muriatic acid is formed. _ In this commu-
nication they offered no decided opinion respecting its nature.
M. Ampere had the goodness to give me some of this substance
and M. Clement having requested me to submit it to some ana-
lytical tests I made several experiments upon it, which convinced
me, that it was a new substance undecompounded, in any of
the circumstances to which I was able to expose it, and that the
acid formed in the processes upon it was not muriatic acid, but a new
acid possessing a striking resemblance to that body: :
M. Gay Lussac (to whom M. Clement had furnished some of the
substance and with whom he had made some experiments upon
it before the communication of his memoir,) on Monday Dec[superscript]r[/superscript]. 6 read
to the institute a paper in which he stated that the acid formed
by its action [deletion]on[/deletion] [insertion]upon[/insertion] hydrogene is a peculiar one. He mentioned se-
veral interesting particulars respecting the mode of its production
and he compared it to oxymuriatic gas or chlorine and stated
that two hypotheses might be founded upon its nature and that
it might be considered either as an undecompounded substance or
as a compound of oxygen. M. Gay Lussac is still engaged in ex-
periments on this substance and from his activity and great
sagacity a complete chemical history of it may be anticipated.
But as the mode of procuring the substance is now known to
the chemical world in general, and as the combinations and agen-
cies of it offer an extensive field for enquiries, and will probably
occupy the attention of many persons, and as the investigation of it
is not pursued by the discoverer himself, nor particularly by the gen-
tlemen to whom it was first communicated, I shall not hesitate
