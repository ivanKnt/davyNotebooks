15 Grains of salt from Lake Albura gave 5 1/2 of
carbonate of lime: The solution evaporated
afforded 6.5 grains, principally sulphates of Potassa
& Muriate of Soda & no [insertion]salt of[/insertion] magnesia _
A new and a very curious substance has recently occupied the
attention of chemists at Paris
This substance was accidentally discovered about two years ago by
M. Courtois a manufacturer of saltpetre at Paris. In his processes
for procuring soda from the ashes of sea-weeds (cendres de vareck) he
found the iron vessels employed much corroded and in searching
for the cause of this effect he made the discovery _ The substance is
procured from the ashes after the extraction of the carbonate of soda
with great facility and merely by the action of [deletion]the[/deletion] sulphuric
acid_ When the acid is concentrated so as to produce much
heat the substance appears as a vapour of a beautiful violet colour
which condenses in crystals having the colour and the lustre of
plumbago.
M. Courtois soon after he had discovered it gave specimens of it
to M. M. Desormes & Clement for chemical examination; and
those gentlemen read a short memoir upon it at a meeting
at the Institute of France on Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 29 In this memoir
These [insertion]able Chemists[/insertion] described its principal properties, they mentioned
that its specific gravity is about four times that of water, that it
becomes a violet coloured gas at a temperature below that of boil-
ing water. that it combines with the metals and with Phospho-
rus and Sulphur and likewise with the alkalies and metallic ox-
