When the compound of Euchlorine & Iodine
dissolved in water was treated in the
same way its colour did not change:
by distillation  :an acid having
the [insertion]same[/insertion] such as the compound of Euc & Iodine
rose & then a substance remained
of the consistence of sulphuric acid
& which acted on vegetable colours
like sol: of iodine in sulphuric acid _
On evaporating still further a little iodine

When sulphuric acid was added to oxychlorine
acid dry (no change) apparently a very slight
solution only._ When water was added the the whole
become yellow together: but afforded only
the same results as in last exp[superscript]t[/superscript] ie no
separation of oxyionic acid_.
[person_048]M De Saussure[/person_048] passed electrical sparks repeatedly
for nearly 2 hours through vapour of Iodine
but no apparent change: - mixed together likewise
- This day 23._
passed iodine through common [unclear]sul[/unclear].
the cor:Sub. when fluid was purple
but became white. by cooling no good action
& iodine bright claret solution
on adding water whole became
yellow not much iodine absorbed
on precipitation by ammon[unclear]icl[/unclear]
precipitate a little yellow
This day acted on oxybarame by Phosphoric acid no change
