a liquor which gave much of the compound
acid & which left sulphate of Barytes .
{ The triple compound is very little soluble
{ in water scarcely gives after digestion with
water any residuum & a very slight turbidness
only to sulphuric acid._
The compound acid precipitates muriate of
Barytes.

Sulphuric acid when mixed with [deletion]hydroc[/deletion][insertion]Chlori[/insertion]onic
acid & distilled gave off a little iodine
towards the end of the process; but the
acid that rose had the smell of Chlorionic
acid at first & afterwards of Sulphuric
& a substance having the characters of
a salt of Platinum remained
