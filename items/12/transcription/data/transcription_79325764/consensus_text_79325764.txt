with diluted muriatic acid probably from the coformation
of a little carbonate.
When the substance obtained from the solution which passed the filtre
 was strongly heated in a glass tube iodine was liberated & sulphuric acid condensd
in the tube and the acid continued to be given off from the substance even after the
iodine ceased to come over The remainder was sulphate of barytes_ The acid is
apparently pure sulphuric acid.
 Muriate of barytes added to the peculiar acid compound caused a strong [insertion]white[/insertion] pre-
cipitate to fall down which when dryed & heated gave off much iodine
When the compound acid was digested with
carbonate of Baryta so as to remain
slightly acid _ the water evaporated still
gave the compound acid - When its acidity
was destroyed by carbonate of Baryta. it
gave scarcely a sensible residuum
- By repeatedly digesting sulphuric acid
with the triple compound gained much compound
acid & there [underline]remained only sulphate of Baryta[/underline].
The compound acid obtained in this way was
very yellow when heated & acted on gold.
- the compound acid seems likewise
to act on platinum.
