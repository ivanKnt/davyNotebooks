6 Grains of the triple compound of barium which had been drid on
 paper over a lamp. were boild for some time with 2 grains of sulphur-
ic acid diluted with water when filterd.. 3.75 gr of [insertion]an[/insertion] insoluble substn rend whit
when heatd [insertion]not quite to red[/insertion] gave off much iodine and 3.3 remained when treat[superscript]d[/superscript] with muriatic
acid 2.1 of of sulphate of barytes remaind The fluid that had come through
was evaporatd to dry & 2.4 of solid matter remained which was intense-
ly acid easily fusible [deletion]&[/deletion] very soluble in water of a yellowish colour and
which after reddening vegetable blues destroyed them When heatd it first gave
off much sulphuric acid & then a great quantity of iodine separated
and the remainder (sulphate of barytes) weighd. .25 gr. only
2 Gr[superscript]s[/superscript]. of the same triple compound when heatd to Whiteness
gave of much iodine & became 1.1 gr. when sulphuric acid was added to
the substance remaining a little iodine appeared and when boild more iodine
came off. & when the sulphuric acid appeared all driven off
much iodine came off. & the sulphate of Baryta formed
weighed exactly 1.14 grains.

3 grains of our sulphuric acid had added to

they gave off much iodine by heating than 2. when
they still gave off iodine so then 5 in all [deletion]13 [superscript][unclear]th[/unclear][/superscript][/deletion]
