Made a very decisive exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on the
oxybarame in relation to Gay Lussac's
imagined acid; several grains of oxybarame
were acted on by [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]3 drops of sulphuric acid
diluted with water. & boiled for a long
time with it . This oxy[superscript]e[/superscript]. had [underline]barely[/underline] the
power of reddening turmeric & contained very
little barame. - The fluid was filtered off
& the residuum washed till it
did not change [underline]litmus[/underline]. This residuum
heated gave off [underline]abundance[/underline] of [underline]iodine[/underline]. So
that the oxybarame was in [insertion]great[/insertion] excess
& this was further proved by the solid
matter becoming alkaline like oxybarame.
The fluid evaporated gave a strong acid
substance that reddened vegetable blues
& then destroyed them & that when cooled
was partly & very deliquescent. This
substance distilled gave Sulphate of Baryta
for a fixed residuum & Sulphuric acid
