it was chrystaline.
Ox le[unclear][deletion]x[/deletion][/unclear] . acted here on Ox silver upon
the euchloric acid
On distilling the oxymuriate of Potash and fluate of Potash together with
sulphuric acid & nitrous acid . nothing remarkable occurred.
When nitrous acid is made to act on the triple compound [insertion]it dissolves it &[/insertion] a [deletion]vegetable[/deletion]
quadruple compound is obtained which crystallizes by cooling on apply
heat the nitr[deletion]ous[/deletion] ic acid is driven off & the triple compound remains
unaltered.
Iodine was sublim[superscript]d[/superscript] in nitrous vapour and the colour changed
from orange to deep orange and red brown. but as the vessel cooled
The iodine condensed unaltered & the nitrous vapour regaind its peculiar
colour and smell
[Ink sketch representing what appears to be a glass tube associated with Davy's experimentations on this page. Each end of the tube is narrowed, which would prevent the nitrous vapour from escaping. The lines extending from each end appear to be spatulas used in chemistry, with the small circular ends holding the solid, in this case iodine, in place in the tube. These would be fixed in place with clamps so that the tube could be heated and observed.]
When the triple compound & fluate of Potassa was
dissolved the iodine rem ains in a platina tube
So . is the Platina covered

- This eveng. apper[superscript]d[/superscript] to me that
triple compound of Barium [unclear]forms[/unclear] a Nitrc Acid

gave a volatile compound.
-- Qure . to distill this tomorrow
