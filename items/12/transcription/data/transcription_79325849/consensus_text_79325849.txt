[deletion]A neutral sulphate is made[/deletion] When sulphuric acid is so
saturatd by the triple compound as to leave a neutral
sulphate by decomposition the mixture is nevertheless acid
When [deletion]the acid of[/deletion] water not sufficient to dissolve the whole substance
is digested on it it becomes acid first reddens vegetable blues &

white powder which was very acid.
When sulphuric acid is added to the triple compound and fluate of
potash they [deletion]form[/deletion] make a paste together without any markd
action in the cold on heating them some
results occurred which require further
investigation.
