yeilded iode or Baryte._
Thought it possibl[deletion]y[/deletion]e that it might
be decomposed by mercury or silver.
so as to afford Barium tried
both those bodies but without success
- They gave only a little colour
to the iode of Barium.
To that though ioodine has
a less att[superscript]n[/superscript] for Barium than oxygene
- yet Silver & mercury do not attract
iode so strongly (as Barium)
-Passed iodine through fluate of Potassa heated [insertion]& fused[/insertion]
but there was no marked action
Made a mixture of oxypotassame
& fluate of Potassa & acted on
then by sulphuric acid. in one
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] Azote came out; but this
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] doubtful. it is far from improbable
that a compound of fluorine & iodine is formed
