When very little sulphuric acid was digested
with much oxybarame. the fluid remaining
afterwards is acid; & reddens vegetable
blues; gives a fluid when evaporated that
apparently contains sulphuric acid & Baryta
- When Baryta [insertion]water[/insertion] was used to precipitate the
solution till it was nearly neutral._ as
long as it was acid it retained
the same qualities; afforded the same results
by evaporations & the precipitate collected
& washed afforded iodine by decomposition

try oxybarame in Phosphoric acid.

When oxide of Lead & iodine are rubbd together they make a tasteless
chocolate powder no parts of the mixture seems soluble in water
 [deletion]this mixture when heated[/deletion] but when boild some part is dissolved which
is a sweetish substance By heat it gives out a large quantity of
iodine The substance which remains is of a yellow colour from which
no iodine can[deletion]t[/deletion] be obtained by farther heating it but by heating it
with sulphuric acid it instantly gave out iodine in considerable
quantities._ [deletion]the[/deletion]
{ After the triple compound acted on by sulphuric acid
{ & the solution decomposed by heat- left a glacial
body which contained Barytes. & became of
a pink colour._
The glacial body acts on Platinum._
