In several experiments made on the triple compound some new
phenomena were obserd when the chlorionic acid was digested with
white oxide of lead procured by precipitation from nitrate of
lead there seemed to be no separation of chlorine &
iodine & no proof that [underline]Iodic[/underline] acid exists in
this compound. . for the fluid to the last had the
power of destroying vegetable colours & the peculiar
smell of chlorionic acid;-
With oxide of silver there was a different result
a white precipitate was formed probably muriate
of silver & an acid fluid; which gave
white chrystals by evaporation which retained
acid properties; but when ammonia was
added to those chrystals , a solid mater
precipitated ([deletion]not [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] which blackened like the [underline]iode[/underline]
[underline]of silver[/underline]: & on decomposing the ammoniacal
substance by heat .iodine rose but [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
remained a substance like the yellow oxide
of silver; so that in this instance a
triple compound only was formed.
- Found that when Euchlorine was made to
act upon [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] iodine whether liquid
or in vapour the iodine dissolved without
effervescence: _ the fluid became more
acid in consequence of dissolving iodine
