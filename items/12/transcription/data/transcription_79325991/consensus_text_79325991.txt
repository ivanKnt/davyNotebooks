My dear Sir
One of the principal objects [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]that I[/insertion]
[deletion]I proposed to myself[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]of my study[/deletion] proposed to [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] in[/deletion] to myself[/insertion] in the voyage I am
now making was the study of the phaenomena
[deletion]chemistry of[/deletion] of Volcanoes. It is in these
phaenomena that the chemistry of Nature is
displayed upon the greatest scale that the products
of the interior of the [deletion]globe[/deletion] surface of the
globe are submitted to our examination &
that the effects of fusion & of [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]refrigeration[/deletion] [deletion]up[/deletion] slow refrigeration upon stony
substances under different degrees of heat
& of pressure are most extensively displayed.
- ..In understanding an investigation of the
facts presented by some of the most remarkable
recent & extinct Volcanoes I was
induced to hope that [deletion]some new feat[/deletion] the
improved state of chemical [insertion]& electrochemical[/insertion] investigation
might enable me to form some opinion
