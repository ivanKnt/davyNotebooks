. This day. March 6[superscript]th[/superscript] [insertion]1814.[/insertion] At Genoa
I made a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on [underline]Iodine[/underline].
& others on the Torpedo & on the decomposition
of the fluates.
- I found that when [underline]Muriate[/underline] of Baryta was
mixed with [underline]Potassame[/underline] there was a slight preicpitate
but on evaporating there seemed to be no
muriate of Pot: formed & both substances fused together
& were decomposed by sulphuric acid giving Iodine
& Muriatic acid. When Muriate of Magnesia
& Muriate of lime were mixed with Potassa[underline]m[/underline]e
there were slight precipitates & it seems that
a decomposition had taken place for on
distilling to dryness [underline]Iodine[/underline] rose in vapour.
in distilling the mixture from [underline]M.lime[/underline] in
a close vessel there was fusion, with much
effervescence & [underline]iodine[/underline] rose, quere was
not water present & hydrogene produced.
- When Potassa was heated with Boracic
acid it gave a yellow glass which was
partly soluble in water & had no
alkaline properties & from this glass [underline]iodine[/underline]
& Boracic acid were produced by Sulphuric
acid._
When a little muriatic or sulphuric
acid were added to [underline]Potassame[/underline] its solution
still reddened [deletion]vegetable blues.[/deletion] turmeric;
