but it likewise reddened & embrowned litmus
- When [underline]silica[/underline] was added to Potassa[underline]m[/underline]e [deletion]there[/deletion]
in fusion there seemed to be a
combination [insertion]with slight effervescence[/insertion] but the alkaline property
still remained in the [underline]mixture[/underline] which when
the silica was in great excess was
partly soluble [underline]in water[/underline] & silica was
precipitated from it by an acid._
Potassa[underline][m[/underline]e long exposed in a platina crucible
in a charcoal fire [deletion]eff[/deletion] effervesced as
if it had absorbed carbonic acid
- Quere will it absorb sulphureous acid
& Carbonic [underline]acid[/underline] gas. if so another
proof of its alkaline quality
_ The true 2 [underline]chloride of Iron[/underline] . made by burning
iron in [underline]Chlorine[/underline] & dissolving in water
[deletion]&[/deletion] dissolves a little [underline]Ittria[/underline], Magnesia [deletion]&[/deletion] glucine
&c becomes darker coloured; but
gives no precipitate._
Could not make a glucine that
did not [underline]precipitate[/underline]. Prussiate of Potash blue
& . it gave alkalescence to the fluate
of Potassa. - Quere again if the
reason I have given is true
could not make Magnesia give
alkalescence even with an excess of
[underline]ferranea[/underline]._
