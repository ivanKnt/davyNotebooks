[underline]Potassame & oxypotassame[/underline]. Carbonic acid gas had not
action on solution of [underline]Potassame[/underline] did not even change
its colour: but instantly rendered yellow solution of oxypotassame
& a powder seemed to precipitate from it & afterwards
dissolved. .Quere was it iodine . or a compound of oxygene & iodine
or oxyionic acid._
Sulphureous acid acting on [underline]Potassame[/underline] [deletion]became[/deletion] [insertion]made it/insertion] of a golden
colour but did not [deletion]change its[/deletion] disengage iodine_ acted
on by Nitric acid the mixture gave iodine & a
brown powder_ Evaporated to dryness the Solution containing
sulphureus acid afforded abundance of that substance
to sulphuric acid - but afforded more to muriatic
acid or at least no sensible quantity ._ Quere does
[underline]Potassame[/underline] combine with [underline]Muriatic acid[/underline], or is Hydroionic
acid formed? _ Sulphureous acid passed into
[underline]oxypotassame[/underline] instantly precipitated abundance of
[underline]iodine[/underline] [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] probably sulphate of Potassa was formed
[underline]Oxalic acid[/underline] instantly precipitated iodine from 3
but scarcely changed [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] 2. heated with 2.
left a saline mass possessing slightly acid properties.
& which gave abundance of iodine to sulphuric
acid._. [underline]Carbonic acid[/underline] or Sulphureous a good
test for [underline]triple[/underline].
Hydro Phosphoric acid fused with 2 gave fumes of
a peculiar smoking acid & leave a substance
not [deletion]acid[/deletion] yeilding iodine to Sulphuric acid
- This will be best way to procure hydroionic
acid ._ .-.
Quere will iodine decompose Carbonate of Potassa.-
