When Lime water is made to act upon iodine there is a triple compound of
iodine [deletion]lime[/deletion] [insertion]containing[/insertion] oxygen when heated it is rapidly decomposed iodine is driven
off & lime formed there is likewise a double compound of iodine & lime
which is very difficultly decomposed by heat.
A solution of hydrophosphorus acid when put in contact with the triple
compound developes iodine with the double compound it effervesces no
iodine is separated and the compound is dissolved giving a yellow colour
Phosphorous acid is neutralized by the double compound of iodine & Potassium
without decomposition on heating the compound to redness it blackened.
a white neutral salt was left which gave abundance of iodine & sulphureous
acid when decomposed by sulphuric acid the salt very fusible and undecom-
posed by a white heat. When the white salt was heated both sulphuric acid
a smell of sulphureous & phosphorous acids is evident.
March 9. detained here by contrary winds made a

- I began by ascertaining that Carbonic acid had no action
on the triple or double compound of [deletion]oxygene[/deletion] Iodine.
I was misled yesterday by using a bottle containing sulphate
of Mercury or sulphate probably probably & Sulphuric acid with marble
& it is probably that [deletion]the[/deletion] Sulphureous acid was given off
with the Carbonic acid. I found that iodine dissolved in
[unclear]Sulfur[/unclear] carbonate of Potassa with effervescence & left
[underline]Potassame[/underline] . Memm it is probable that it decomposes it._
I distilled together Potassame & [underline]Hydrophosphoric acid[/underline] of the consistenc
of syrup & condensed the products in water, there came over at
