I used this acid for making the Hydri[deletion]m[/deletion]ates of [underline]Calcium[/underline] [insertion]by marble &lime[/insertion]
Magnesia Ittria Glucine & Zircone._ [insertion]by the earths[/insertion]
The H[superscript]e[/superscript]. of Calc. had a taste very like that of Muriate of lime
was deliquescent [underline]like it[/underline] when made from Marble & heated in
close vessels [deletion]slightly[/deletion] [insertion]not[/insertion] decomposed [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] decomposed giving off
Iodine & forming lime when heated in air; by adding [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
oxypossme to it in close vessels & heating iodine rapidly
givn off:- The compound formed from Hyd[superscript]e[/superscript] & [underline]lime[/underline]
& like de[superscript]d[/superscript] in close vessels probably from the excess of
of iodine forming a little triple compound_ This compound
by dissolving [underline]iodine[/underline] in Lime water. a compound formed
decomposable giving off iodine at a low heat
& another not decomposable & these soluble at a low heat
- [deletion]Muriate[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]Hydodmate[/unclear][/insertion] of Magnesia more astringent than M M.
decomposed giving off [underline]Iodine[/underline] & [unclear]Hydroinc[/unclear] in the air.
less decomposable when heated in close vessls. but
a little decomposable these probably [insertion]from[/insertion] [underline]oxymagnesane[/underline]
- Ittria more [insertion]easily[/insertion] soluble than G or Z. gave a very astringent
[underline]salt[/underline] [underline]soluble[/underline] decomposable by heat [insertion]in air[/insertion] giving off Hdyr .&
Iodine..
Glucine D[superscript]d[/superscript]. astringent salt less soluble than the Ittria
salt.
Zircon very astringent. soluble decomposable by heat
-
[deletion]by[/deletion] Salt of Ittria not [underline]renderng alkalis[/underline]. Sol: Fluate of Potassa
[underline]Sol: of Zircone[/underline] rendering it [unclear][deletion]xx[/deletion][/unclear].
