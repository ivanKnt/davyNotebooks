Though iron might be separated from Zircone by
Iodine as [underline]Ferran[unclear]ea[/unclear][/underline] is very [deletion]soluble[/deletion] volatile but
not far after heating the [underline]compound[/underline] to redness
it gave after solution in Mur: Ac: abundance of
a prussiate very blue._
[underline]Did not try [underline]Silica[/underline]. will try it tomorrow[/underline]..
Tried the action of [deletion]Iodine[/deletion] [insertion]Potassa[underline]m[/underline]e[/insertion] on dry Boracic acid.
effervesced gave a [underline]violet[/underline] [underline]glass[/underline]: but colour
from gaseous [underline]iodine[/underline], the glass after cooling pale
[underline]olive[/underline] probably . the Bor. Ac decomposed.
. when this glass was heated to whiteness & decomposed
by Sulp: gave iodine, - but very little.
There was a strong action upon the Plate
glass. probably from [underline]boron[/underline] devitrified; Iodine
evidently given off when the mixture of [underline]Pme[/underline]
Boracic were heated by the blow pipe for
[underline]it burned[/underline] in the Hydrogene of the
 lamp. - The [underline]glass[/underline] fused [insertion]heated with potass[/insertion] gave with Muriatic
acid a pink solution .- [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] The[/deletion]  
[deletion]olive[/deletion] olive colour was not destroyed by solution
in Potassa by heat. or by sol: of Potassa.
- [underline]Pme[/underline] [deletion]heated[/deletion] dissolved in Phosphorous
[underline]acid[/underline] without develloping [underline]iodine[/underline] [underline]oxypame[/underline] gave
it instantly. In the mixture of [underline]Pme[/underline] &
Phosphorus acid the qualities neutralized &
they gave a white salt by
evaporation of a mild sub bitter taste
