in excess Potassame still existed; probably however
some muriate of Potassa was formed. Quere if a
triple compound. Pa Ch. & Io. _. [underline]Potassane[/underline] made
from common alkali treated with Hydroionic & heated
to redness left a salt not [underline]alkaline[/underline].. lasting acrid cooling
something like nitre not disgreable._ Mem to
correct what I have said about [underline]alkaline[/underline] proportions.
- Hydroionic decomposed by triple compound. & Iodine
set free; but no compound acid that I can
find given off - if acid not in great excess
triple compound formed in the common way
still retain its alkaline properties. ie it is all decomposed
by the oxygne in the salt;- At first the compound
of Hydroionic & Iodine is produced, [underline]the red compound[/underline].
Afterwards [underline]iodine[/underline] by heat is given off.--
In distilling 2 compound & Phosphoric acid.
a little iodine is formed which always dissolves
& combines with Hydroionic acid. & makes a deep
red fluid._. The pure Hydroionic gas dissolved
by water is without colour.
Hydrophosphorous acid does not decompose [underline]Potassame[/underline].
but seems merely to mix with it.
Endeavoured to ascertain if there was any iodine
in the Algae, or in Sponges or in seawater.
