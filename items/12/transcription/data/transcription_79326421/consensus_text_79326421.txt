Quere may there not be two compounds of Potass[underline][superscript]m[/superscript][/underline] & iodine
one alkaline, the other not. - not [underline]probable[/underline]?
- May not the compound at the minus be a compound of [underline]Potassa[/underline]
& [underline]Potassame[/underline], no._
March 11 The acid compound of chlorine & iodine possesses a very astringent taste & has a
suffocating smell when evaporated principally arises in vapour with the water of the solu-
tion has no distinct action upon platina - when evaporated a solid remains which seems
to be the same substance & possesses the same power of reddening vegetable blues _ When the
second compound is poured into ammonia a black powder falls down but there is
no effervescence, & this is the fulminating compound of I. & Azote. & this offers perhaps the
best mode of producing Azotane
The hydroionic acid combines instantly with ammonia without any charge
and the compound produced is more pungent than the Muriate of ammonia it seems
to have nearly the same degree of volatility. Lime separates the iodine from
the compound acid of iodine & chlorine but a brown powder is produced.
Ascertained that [underline]Hydroionic acid[/underline] is decomposed [underline]by heat[/underline] in
a glass tube.._ giving off iodine which combines with the
remaining acid & forms a red fluid; Quere can the little oxygene
that may have remained in my tubes have any thing to do with this
-(Potame heated in muriatic acid gas forms [underline]Pne[/underline]: but regains
by Heat & this decomposes a part of the Hydroionic acid, so that
a yellow fluid is formed. I found that Muriatic acid partly decomposed
[underline]Potassame[/underline] & [deletion][unclear]Potassane[/unclear][/deletion] Hydroionic partly decomposed [underline]Pne[/underline] so that
their affinities are nearly alike Hydrionic instantly decomposes
[underline]fluorate[/underline] ie [underline]fluate of Potassa[/underline]
When Solution of [underline]triple compound[/underline] is treated with Nitric
or sulp[superscript]c[/superscript] acid there is no effervescence, Hence oxygene ought
to exist in the [deletion]triple compound[/deletion] precipitate which is
[underline]chocolate coloured[/underline]. Tried this substance gives no oxygene
disolving in potassa nor in Alcohol nor in sulphuric
acid. rises like [underline]iodine[/underline]. could not procure enough
