After the mixture [deletion]had[/deletion] was cool
the retort was attached to
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] an airholder containing
Nitrous gas which was suffered
to enter, exactly 6 1/2 of gas
were required to fill the
globe.
-Now it is extremely improbable
that [deletion]a combination[/deletion] of three
volumes of Nitrous gas & 1
of oxygene [insertion]if they combine[/insertion] should contract
exactly in the same ratio as
2 & 1 & all these facts
confirm my view of the
composition of [deletion]aeriform[/deletion] Nitrous
acid gas..-
