Propositions on Radient Heat by F. Delaroche. M.D.
I. Invisible radiant heat [deletion]may in[deletion] [insertion][deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] under[/insertion] some circumstances passes
directly through glass
2. The quantity of radient heat which passes directly through
glass is so much greater [deletion]relative[/deletion] [insertion]in proportion[/insertion] [deletion]relative[/deletion] to the whole heat emitted in the
same direction, as the temperature of the source of heat is more
elevated
3. The calorific rays which have already passed through a
screen of glass, experience in passing through a second glass
screen of a similar nature, a much smaller diminution
of their intensity than they did in passing through the first
screen
4. The rays emitted by a hot body differ from each other in
their [deletion]faculty to pass[/deletion] [insertion]power of passing[/insertion] through glass.
5. A thick glass though as much or more permeable to
light than a thin glass of worse quality, allows a much smal-
ler quantity of radient heat to pass. The difference is so much
the less as the temperature of the radiating source is more ele-
vated.
6 The quantity of heat which a hot body yields in a given time
by radiation to a cold body [deletion]situated[/deletion] [insertion]placed[/insertion] at a distance, increases cae-
teris paribus, in a greater ratio than the excess of temperature
of the first body over the second.
