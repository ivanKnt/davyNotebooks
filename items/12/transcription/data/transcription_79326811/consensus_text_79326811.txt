[deletion]In 1800, I made a number of experiments[/deletion] [insertion]In this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] no corrections were made for[/insertion]
[deletion]on the deflagration of Nitre & charcoal[/deletion] [insertion]the alterations of pressure & temperature which[/insertion]
however could not have been considerable
In another experiment of the same kind conducted
[insertion]with more accuracy[/insertion] 100 measures of Nitrous gas [insertion]& oxygene in excess[/insertion] in contact
& with a solution of Potassa absorbed [deletion][insertion]in three days[/insertion] 74.5[/deletion]
[insertion]and after agitated[/insertion] [insertion]in 5 days [insertion]absorbed[/insertion] 74.5[/insertion] of oxygene, & [deletion]the result is as[/deletion]
[deletion]near as can be expected[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] temperature
was higher by 4[superscript]o[/superscript] Fah[superscript]t[/superscript]. & the pressure
less by .1 of an inch [deletion]before[/deletion] at the end
than at the commencement of the
experiment
- In [deletion]1800[/deletion] [insertion]1799[/insertion] I made a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
decomposition of Nitre by charcoal the details of
which are published in a work entitled
"Researches Chem & Philosophical, the examination
of these experiments will shew that the
proportion of oxygene in Nitric acid
must be in a greater ratio than that
of 2 Volumes to 1 of Azote, This in
an experiment in which 60 grains of
Nitre & 9 of charcoal was detonated together
the gas disengaged & all the products
were thrown into a gas under mercury
& the carbonic acid combined with the
Potassa disengaged by [deletion]Mur[/deletion] Sol. of Muriatic
acid_ These gasses consisted of 20. Carbonic
