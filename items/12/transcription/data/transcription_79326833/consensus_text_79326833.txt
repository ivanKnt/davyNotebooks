[deletion]That[/deletion] The existence of a large quantity of
water in the prismatic nitrate of
ammonia, I have proved by the action of
Magnesia upon it. when Magnesia & the
salt are heated together at a temperature
not sufficient for the decomposition of
the Nitrate water is produced in abundance
-I endeavored to [deletion]ascertain the exact quantity[/deletion] [insertion]determine whether the calculation [deletion]above given[/deletion][/insertion]
[insertion]was correct to[/insertion] by the following experiment grains of Lime
were heated with of Nitrate of Ammonia
there came over inches of [deletion]gas over the[/deletion] Ammonia
[deletion]now the whole gave[/deletion] & grains of solution of
ammonia.
- Besides the proofs given of the correctness
of my estimate of the composition of Nitric
acid gained from the decomposition of Nitrate
of Ammonia, I have gained many others
by direct experiment._ -I mixed together eleven
measures of [deletion]pure [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Nitrous gas & 9 measures
of [deletion]pure[/deletion] oxygene gas [deletion]in[/deletion] in a tube containing
a small quantity of [deletion]strong[/deletion] solution of Potassa
-the diminution at first was to [deletion][unclear]4[/unclear] measures[/deletion] 3.75
measures: but [deletion]after it[/deletion] at the end of [deletion]two days[/deletion] 36 hours
[insertion]the vessel having been often agitated[/insertion] There remained only a measure of gas which
was oxygene gas mixed with [deletion]the [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] Azote, arising
[deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]from the[/insertion] [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]small[/deletion] minute but[/insertion] [unclear]unavoidable[/unclear] impurity of the gasses employed
