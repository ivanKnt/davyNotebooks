On the [insertion]mutual[/insertion] decomposition
of some [deletion]fluates [unclear]& M[/unclear][/deletion] combinations
of fluorine & chlorine._
by S[superscript]r[/superscript]. H. Davy.
M. M. Gay Lussac & Thenard have stated [insertion]in their physical & chemical researches[/insertion] that
when solutions of Zircone, Ittria or Glucine [deletion]are mixed[/deletion]
[deletion]in[/deletion] Muriatic acid is mixed with a solution of
Potassa in fluoric acid the [deletion]mixture[/deletion] [insertion]fluid produced[/insertion] exhibits
alkaline properties, even [deletion]though[/deletion] [insertion]when[/insertion] both the solutions
employed were previously slightly acid. They likewise
state that the precipitates obtained exhibit
no [deletion]alkaline[/deletion] [insertion]acid[/insertion] properties & they mention the fact
as an exception to the general law of
the [insertion]double[/insertion] decomposition of neutral [insertion]salts[/insertion] in which the
 resulting [deletion]instances[/deletion] [insertion]solutions[/insertion] [deletion]are likewise always neutral[/deletion]
exhibit the neutral the acid or the alkaline
properties of the substance from which they are
formed._ [deletion][person_005]M. Berthollet[/person_005] in his review of[/deletion]
[deletion]the work of [person_012]M. M. Gay Lussac[/person_012] & [person_201]Thenard[/person_201][/deletion]
[deletion]has endeavoured [insertion]particularly mentioned these facts observed by them[/insertion] directed the attention of[/deletion]
[deletion]chemists to the facts observed by M. M. Gay[/deletion]
[deletion][person_012]Lussac[/person_012] & [person_201]Thenard[/person_201] as opposed to this law[/deletion]
[deletion]of determinate proportions as one calculated[/deletion]
[deletion]to enlighten the discussion concerning the[/deletion]
[deletion]law of attractions & the general theory of[/deletion]
[deletion]definite proportions.[/deletion]
[deletion]These phaenomena appeared to me well[/deletion]
