We drink of rapture from the cup of life
-Whilst yet it sparkles & oerflows with youth,
Whilst yet the spirit on the surface [insertion]swims-[/insertion]
A deeper draught a different taste supplies
Of sober reason mellowed to the [deletion]taste,[/deletion] [insertion]sense[/insertion]
Strong fragrant & yet bitter - In the dregs
Old age & pain & death _ Mortality
