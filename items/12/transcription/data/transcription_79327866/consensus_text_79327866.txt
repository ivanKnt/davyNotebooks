[deletion]Fills all my bosom, For the verdant hills, & with honest pride[/deletion]
[deletion]And Pastoral Glens I hail the [deletion]sovereign[/deletion] [insertion]mighty[/insertion] people who by strength[/deletion]

Fills all my bosom. Albion thee I hail
[deletion]Mother of Heroes[/deletion] Mother of Heroes, [deletion]M[/deletion] Mighty in thy strength

Deliverer from thee the fire proceeds
Withering the tyrant. Not a fire close
Of When [deletion]a sign of Glory between between high[/deletion] destructive but a living light
[deletion]For Europe.[/deletion]
Of honour glory & security
A light of Science liberty & peace
[deletion]Morn[/deletion] Evening
A moment past the sky was bright & clear
But now a mist obscures the ambient air
The mist becomes a cloud which gathers round
Thy brow, at first so white, so [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] bright so pure
The snow seems [deletion]blue[/deletion] [insertion]dark[/insertion] beneath [deletion]between[/deletion] its [insertion]delicate[/insertion] fringe, [deletion]but now[/deletion]
[deletion]ether[/deletion] rapidly descends & fills thy glens ^ [deletion]x[/deletion] And now it spreads [deletion]in [unclear]xx xx[unclear][/deletion] a [insertion]thicker canopy[/insertion]
[deletion]&[/deletion]And covers all thy rocks., It's tints are changed
Its fleecy whiteness gone, the sun beams fade
[deletion]&[/deletion] And lose Their glory in its sullen gleam.
Portentous of the storm; & now the rain
Descends in floods The angry lightning gleams
The thunder roars, the tempest howls [deletion]along[/deletion] 
Thy [unclear][deletion]xxxxx[/deletion][/unclear] [insertion]echoing [deletion]song[/deletion][/insertion] cliffs And the vext main
Mingles her white foam with The troubled floods,
The torrents of The mountain roll along.
