In vain the manly bosom strives
To banish sympathetic care,
-The unequal tenour of our lives,
With every transport mingles fear
Upon thy snows or glitter where the streams
They feed with crystal waters pour in foam
Amidst thy dark deep glens [deletion]The shaggy woods[/deletion] [insertion]Thy shaggy woods [deletion]cloathing[/deletion] [deletion]crested with woods [/deletion][/insertion]
Where the bright Pine & darker cork trees blend
Their varied foliage form a boundary
Where winter seems to mingle with the spring
[deletion]&[/deletion]And lower still the olive tree appears
The work of culture & the leafless vine
And the green meadow where the torrents sleep
Or moves obedient to the wants of man
Nature in savage wildness mountain strength
Breaths in one picture with the forms of art
And all that stamps the social character
A city's walls majestically rise
The guardian of a realm where sounds of war
Alarm the ear Along the [deletion]shore[/deletion] sandy shore
The path [deletion]where[/deletion] the Carthagenian[deletion]s[/deletion] trod appears
When from the Pyrenees his veterans poured
To try the strength of Rome & shed profuse
Her patriot blood at Canna. On the Wave
Triumphant ride the fleets of Oceans Queen
-My heart beats quicker & [deletion]the Patriots glow[/deletion] a healthful glow
