Morning
Dawn Jan.[superscript]y[/superscript] 26. The Canigou.
In the eastern sky the stars their lustre loose
In [insertion]more[/insertion] diffused light As if their orbs
Had melted into air & formed the day
Above the heavens receives a brighter tint
Of purest azure and beneath they glow.
With lovely tints which every instant change
Now purple & now orange and a gleam
Of golden light pours on the tranquil main
[deletion]I cast my eyes upon the western sky[/deletion] [insertion]I turn my eyes [deletion]from the excessive blaze[/deletion][/insertion]
I cast my eyes upon the western coast.
[deletion]And lo thy Giant form O Canigou[/deletion]
[deletion]And in the [unclear]east[/unclear] I see thy giant form.[/deletion]
And lo thy Giant form O Canigou
[deletion]Upraised sublime amidst[/deletion] the [deletion]deep[/deletion] blue [deletion]heaven[/deletion]
[insertion]As if a new creation of the day[/insertion] [deletion]All though faint the morning star is seen[/deletion]
[deletion]Framed in the deep blue [unclear][deletion]xx[/deletion][/unclear] sky snows[/deletion] still
[deletion]So bright thy glittering snows appear they seem as
[deletion]To form another dawn[/deletion]
[deletion]Sublime amidst the deep blue sky where still[/deletion]
[deletion]Though faint the morning star is seen.[/deletion] So bright
Thy glittering snows appear they seem | To form
Another [deletion][unclear]Sun[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]dawn[/insertion] Thy base is [deletion]xxxxx[/deletion] dark
Rising [deletion]as[/deletion] [insertion]through[/insertion] mists that mingle with the wave
[deletion]Morning[/deletion] [deletion]Mida[/deletion] Noon.
The orb of light it's flood of lustre pours
from the mid heaven upon the tranquil sea
Without a tide whose silver mirror spreads
Reflecting forms of mountain & majesty remote
Along the Iberian coast & more remote
In gentle agitation feels & the breeze gives
That to its deep & lovely azure gives
The life of motion. All the [deletion]mountain[/deletion] [insertion]morning[/insertion] mists
Have vanished & the [insertion]miday[/insertion] sun beams sleep
[deletion]from the excessive blaze[/deletion]
As if a new creation [insertion]of the day[/insertion]
[deletion]fixed on high[/deletion]
[deletion]Aspiring [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] the deep blue[/deletion]
[deletion]vaults of heaven[/deletion]
Framed of the morning
clouds for ever fixed.
[deletion]Beneath the radiance of [insertion]the morning[/insertion][/deletion]
And gilded by the expiring [insertion]morning star[/insertion]
