The odour lives beyond the flower-
The balm of virtue never dies._
Its colours have a transient hour
Its odour never dies._
The light that from [deletion]good[/deletion] arts, above
now glimmers in the frosty air
Is broken indistinct & flitting
yet its source is indestructible
So it is with mortal things
