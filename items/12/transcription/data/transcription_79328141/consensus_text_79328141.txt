Years quickly coming quickly going
soon_
Years come & quickly fly
And swiftly move the wings of time
Yet my sweet friend I will not sigh
-.The dew drop on the rose
[insertion][underline]dead branch[/underline][/insertion] In winters chill & frosty clime
Doth long remain, the north wind blows
And lo it rests & turns to ice
And yet that drop in summer suns
Had risen & from its resting place
The odrous flowr embalmed [insertion]the air._[/insertion]
