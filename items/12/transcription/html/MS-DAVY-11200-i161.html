         <p>A mineral acid composed of the elements sulphur, oxygen, and hydrogen. It is a colourless,

         <p>Now known as hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest element and, at standard conditions,
            is a gas of diatomic molecules. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-toxic,
            and highly combustible.</p>

         <p>A silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife. Potassium metal
            reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only

         <p>Symbol/formula: K2O</p>
         
         <p>Potassium oxide. In his 'Elements of Chemical Philosophy', Pt 1, Vol 1 (1812), Davy
            describes how potassa is produced from heating potassium at a low temperature, producing
            a substance containing a large amount of oxygen. When this substance is "heated very
            strongly", it produces "pure potash or potassa" (pp. 323-324).</p>
