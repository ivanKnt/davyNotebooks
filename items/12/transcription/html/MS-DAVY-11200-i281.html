         <p>From 1812 Davy used Faraday as his amanuensis and the following year secured his appointment
            as laboratory assistant at the Royal Institution. Despite a difficult relationship
            with Davy, Faraday later became the dominant figure at the Royal Institution and one
            of the leading scientific personalities of the middle third of the nineteenth century.

         <p>Daughter of Charles Kerr, an Antiguan merchant who made his fortune in highly dubious
            circumstances. Following his death she moved to Britain where she married Schukbrugh
            Apreece who died in 1807. After running a successful literary salon in Edinburgh she
            moved to London where she met Davy and they married on 11 April 1812 two days after
            he had been knighted by the Prince Regent.</p>

         <p>Built in 1844, and since redeveloped, Lesketh-How was the house near Ambleside, in
            the Lake District, where Davy's brother, the physician John Davy, lived. John Davy
            died there in January 1868.</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@?api=1&amp;map_action=map&amp;zoom=13&amp;center=54.43546047534615%2C-2.9675620587101799" target="_blank" title="View location on Google Maps">View location on Google Maps</a></div>

         <p>An element and the heaviest of the group of stable halogens. Bernard Courtois was
            the first to isolate the&nbsp;substance. Whilst in Paris&nbsp;Davy&nbsp;investigated the&nbsp;substance,&nbsp;and&nbsp;proved
            it to be a chemical&nbsp;element&nbsp;describing his results in a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;the Royal Society.
            This caused disputes between Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who had also been researching
            the element.</p>
