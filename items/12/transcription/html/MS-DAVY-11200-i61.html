            was pure carbon in Italy: 'Some Experiments on the Combustion of the Diamond and Other
            Carbonaceous Substances', Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,

            describes how potassa is produced from heating potassium at a low temperature, producing
            a substance containing a large amount of oxygen. When this substance is "heated very
            strongly", it produces "pure potash or potassa" (pp. 323-324).</p>
