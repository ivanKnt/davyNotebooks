In the last [misc]misc_181|Bakerian Lecture[/misc] I [insertion]have[/insertion] hazarded a conjecture whether
the [deletion][chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical][/deletion] difference between the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] & common
carbonaceous substances may not be owing to the presence of
some light & subtle principle [insertion]in the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] which may be[/insertion] [deletion]which is[/deletion] expelled from it by [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical].
[deletion]I have lately been able to put the conjecture to the[/deletion]
[deletion]test of experiment & I have ascertained that it is not[/deletion]
[deletion]founded. I have likewise been able to make some[/deletion]
[deletion]researches[/deletion] An opportunity having lately occurred to me of
putting this conjecture to the test of experiment, I
have availed myself of it [deletion]I have availed myself[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] & I have made a number of experiments
on the combustion of the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] & of other
carbonaceous substances.- Finding [deletion]that the[/deletion] no tendencies
of the truth of [insertion]the[/insertion] above mentioned conjecture, [deletion]I undertook a minute[/deletion]
[deletion]examinations of the [unclear]fluctuation[/unclear] of gas formed in the combustion[/deletion]
[deletion]of my experiments[/deletion] I have sought for other courses

& certain carbonaceous substances [deletion]produce nearly the same[/deletion]
[deletion]quantity of[/deletion] consume nearly the same quantity of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
in combustion & produce a gas having the same
obvious qualities a number of [deletion]suppositions[/deletion] [insertion]conjectures[/insertion] have been
formed to explain the remarkable differences in [insertion]the[/insertion] sensible
[deletion]of qualities[/deletion] [insertion]properties[/insertion] of these bodies by supposing some [deletion]chemical[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] minute [deletion]chemic[/deletion] difference in their chemical

to [deletion][unclear]mention[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]dwell upon[/insertion] them. . .M. M. [person]person_203|Biot[/person] & [person]person_202|Arrago[/person] from the
high refractive power of the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] have supposed that
it may contain [chemical]chemical_022|[deletion]oxyg[/deletion][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]. I ventured to [deletion]suppose[/deletion] [insertion]suggest[/insertion]
in my third [misc]misc_181|Bakerian Lecture[/misc] from the circumstance
of its non conducting power & from the action of
Potassium upon it that it m[deletion]ight[/deletion]ay contain a minute
proportion of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & in my last [misc]misc_181|Bakerian Lecture[/misc]
I have hazarded the idea that it may [deletion]contain[/deletion]
be the carbonaceous principle combined with some light
& subtile element that may be expelled from it by
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]. - M. [person]person_049|Guyton de Morveau[/person] who conceived He
had proved by experiments made 12 years ago that
common carbonaceous substances were oxides of [chemical]chemical_508|Diamond;[/chemical] from
his last researches [deletion][unclear]seems[/unclear] still[/deletion] conducted in the same
manner as those of Mess. M.' [person]person_003|Allen[/person] & [person]person_015|Pepys[/person]

though in admitting a [deletion]minute[/deletion] [insertion]much smaller[/insertion] quantity of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] only than
[insertion] he originally supposed in [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] [/insertion]are [deletion][chemical]chemical_054|Carbon[/chemical] carbonaceous substances[/deletion] & He considers the
[chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] as pure carbonaceous matter, containing [deletion]only a[/deletion] possibly
[deletion]a minute quantity[/deletion] [insertion]some atoms[/insertion] of water of chrystallization -
I have long [deletion]been desirous[/deletion] [insertion]had a desire[/insertion] of making some new experiments on
the [deletion]products of[/deletion] the combustion of the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] & other carbonaceous
Substances & this desire [deletion]has been[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] increased by the new [insertion]lately ascertained[/insertion] facts [deletion]supposed[/deletion]

to examine minutely whether any matter was separated from the

namely that the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] when strongly ignited
by the [insertion]great in[/insertion] lens in a [insertion]thin[/insertion] capsule of [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical] perforated

[deletion]great brilliancy[/deletion] after being withdrawn from

used for attaching them to the [deletion]tray[/deletion] [insertion]capsule[/insertion] was fused &
that some time after the [chemical]chemical_508|diamond[/chemical] was

-The knowledge of this circumstance [deletion]enabled[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]afforded[/deletion] enabled[/insertion] me [deletion]to [unclear]meas[/unclear][/deletion]

- My apparatus consisted of [insertion]clear[/insertion] glass globes [insertion]of the capacity of from 14 to 40 cubical inches[/insertion]

globe before & after the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was brought to the

gas had remained -. And as during the short time
required for the combustion there was no sensible
change either in the thermometer or Barometer
no corrections for pressure or temperature were
rendered necessary -. The change of volume
in the gas after the combustion was estimated
by means of a fine tube connected with a
stop cock adapted by a female screw to the
stop cock of the globe & the absorption was
judged of by the quantity of [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] that
entered the tube. [insertion]which afforded means [insertion]a measure[/insertion] so exact that no [deletion]change[/deletion] [insertion]an alteration[/insertion] however minute could be overlooked.[/insertion] As the [deletion]strength[/deletion] elastic

rose when it was heated & that in considerable

With [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] the green colour makes a green glass with a precipitate of yellowish

& not a purple like [chemical]chemical_060|Manganese[/chemical]. _
[chemical]chemical_420|oxide of copper[/chemical] formed by [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] gave with [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical]
a blueish glass. - [misc]misc_412|smalt[/misc] gave a brown glass fused

Our artificial Science has relations to the [underline]forms of Nature[/underline]; but yet
that which is most important in Nature [underline]life[/underline] is above our [underline]Science[/underline]
The astronomer vainly asserts the perfection of his Science
because He is capable of determining the motions
of 7 planets & 22 sattellites; but comets &
meteoric Bodies which even move in our system
are above his reach & even this Solar system
is a speck in the immensity of space.
& Suns & worlds are beyond our reach.

this there is an endless field for investigation

Men generally find it most easy[unclear]ly[/unclear] to explain every thing who are ignorant

probably the atomic philosophers had an idea [deletion]of[/deletion] exactly of the same kind
as that of the moderns, [person]person_182|Democritus[/person] the pure atomic doctrine _ [person]person_445|Pythagoras[/person] the
doctrine of definite proportions & of [underline]regular forms[/underline]._
And those effects which in common language are ascribed
to [underline]time[/underline], these changes the cause of which is represented
by a word which signifies the measure of duration
are in fact chemical._ For water which is deposited
from the atmosphere dissolves certain parts of even of
rocks & stones. Even the whitest marble contains iron
in a form in which it is capable of being acted upon
by the air. _ Metals are rusted & dissolved - colors are
changed by light. Wood decays from [deletion]the[/deletion] an effect
which is the same as that of slow combustion &
[insertion][unclear]linen[/unclear] is most perishable.[/insertion] all the monuments of art, all that is immortal

And Barbarian warriors are less dangerous than
those laws which are established for the conversation
of our system. _ It is only by means which are
accidently & the most unexpected. Thus the manuscripts

might have been supposed the most destructive [underline]fire[/underline]._

I have repeated these experiments very

[page]142|MS-DAVY-11200-000-00142|dnp12134pp|79325682[/page]
often because [person]person_012|M. Gay Lussac[/person] has stated
that an [deletion]peculiar[/deletion] acid compound of
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical] may be procured
by dropping [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] into a solution
of the triple compound of [deletion][chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical][/deletion] [chemical]chemical_325|Barium[/chemical];
but his conclusions seem to have been founded
upon the want of effervescence in the process
& his experiments were made at a very early
period of the investigation & immediately after
I had discovered the triple compounds. & before
I had obtained them in a state of purity
- It [underline]is possible[/underline] that a binary compound
[otherwork]otherwork_154|of iodine & oxygene may exist in the[/otherwork]
solutions of the triple compounds in
acids yet there are [deletion]some[/deletion] circumstances
opposed to the idea, From the analogy between
[deletion]of[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical] it might have
been expected that [deletion]such a[/deletion] [insertion]such[/insertion] compound would
be coloured & would [insertion]ultimately[/insertion] destroy vegetable colour
but the solutions of the triple compounds in
acids are always free from colour
& do not act upon blue solutions of

the fluid obtained is always acid & always
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] precipitates muriate of Baryta
- I thought it possible that the compound
of [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] might possess this
property [deletion]as [insertion]it belongs to[/insertion] the [chemical]chemical_428|oxychloric acid[/chemical][/deletion]
but on collecting the precipitate
& examining it it had the character
of sulphate of Baryta, - & from
all the facts it appears that
in the action of acids upon the
triple compound[deletion]s[/deletion] new combinations
only are formed.
I take the liberty of proposing for
the triple compounds the names of oxyiodes
because when decomposed by heat they afford

When the fusible [insertion]compound of the[/insertion] substance [insertion]with [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical][/insertion] is distilled with a small quan-

[deletion][chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] and the substance[/deletion], and both these gasses ab-
sorbed by water afforded when acted on by nitrate of sil-
ver the same product as that formed by the action of a so-
lution of the substance in water on the same salt
I attempted to form a compound of the substance with
[chemical]chemical_007|hydrogen[/chemical] directly by heating it in several experiments to
redness in glass tubes filled with [chemical]chemical_007|hydrogen[/chemical]. When the gas
was moist or when the [deletion]fluid[/deletion] [insertion]tube[/insertion] contained vapour a strong
acid fluid was formed of a yellow colour._ When the gas &
the substance were dry there was an expansion of volume
and on breaking the tube, fumes appeared similar to those
produced by the action of the gas formed during the union
of [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] with the substance and which precipitated
in the same manner a solution of [chemical]chemical_433|(nitrate of) silver[/chemical]
I have however never been able to destroy the whole quantity

when the difficultly soluble substance is acted on by a small
quantity of water and heated in a glass tube much gas
spontaneously inflammable is disengaged and a white
sublimate rises which when acted on by cold water [insertion]becomes hot &[/insertion] af-
fords a considerable quantity of a gas having all the proper-
ties of [chemical]chemical_434|hydro-phosphoric [deletion]acid[/deletion][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_435|gas.[/chemical]
The solution of this [insertion]chrytaline[/insertion] substance in water neutralized by
[chemical]chemical_436|Potassa[/chemical] and decomposed by [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] afforded the
peculiar substance[deletion]s[/deletion] but when the solution was heated
strongly [insertion]before its neutralization[/insertion] it left only hydro-phosphorus acid which when
heated gave off hydrophoric gas and became phosphoric
acid
It is easy to explain all these phenomena except the pro-
duction of the acid gas which [deletion]appears[/deletion] [insertion]seems[/insertion] to be a compound
of the peculiar substance and [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] To account for
the appearance of this body it is necessary to suppose the exist-
ance of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] or of water in the substance or of hydro-
gene in [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical]
I used the substance distilled through [chemical]chemical_091|quick Lime[/chemical]
which there is every reason to believe would absorb
all the water united to it but still the acid gas which
gave [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx xx[/unclear] because of[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] when decomposed
by [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] was produced._ I am inclined to attri-
bute the phenomenon to the action of [chemical]chemical_007|hydrogen[/chemical], con-
tained in the [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] and former experiments-
that I have made on [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] by [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] electricity
prove the existence of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] in this substance._ The
quantity of acid gas produced likewise is always small &
limited and I have never been able to produce from the
fixed compound of the substance with [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] more of

producing heat without light, small quantities of a strongly
acid gas generally arise from the mixture, and by the ap-
plication of heat it is produced in greater quantities. When
the substance is in excess an easily fusible and volatile com-
pound of a red colour is obtained. When the [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical]
is in excess the greater part of the product is more fixed._
I examined the gaseous acid formed by the action of
[chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] on the substance with attention . it gives
dense white fumes by combining with the aqueous
vapours in the air. It has a smell very [deletion]analogous[/deletion] [insertion]similar[/insertion] to
that of the solid compound of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] and phospho-
rus [insertion]which itself is very analogous to that of [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical]. _[/insertion] It is rapidly absorbed by water When made to act
upon [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] it forms with it a dense white salt which
when acted on by [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] affords the peculiar sub-
stance and at the same time a smell of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] is
perceived. When [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] is heated in it the same com-
pound as that produced by the action of the new substance
directly upon [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] is formed and [chemical]chemical_007|hydrogen[/chemical] is disen-
gaged. When Potassium is made to act upon it there is no
inflammation as in [chemical]chemical_016|muriatic acid gas[/chemical] but the [chemical]chemical_031|Potassium[/chemical]
becomes converted into a body similar to that produced by
its combustion in the vapour of the substance and a gas
which burns in the same manner as [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] is disen-
gaged._
When the easily fusible and volatile compound of the
substance with [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] is heated in water it rapidly
dissolves in it and forms a strong acid which when eva-
porated leaves [chemical]chemical_434|[insertion]hydrophosphorous[/insertion] acid[/chemical] and which before its evapora-
tion neutralized by [chemical]chemical_436|Potassa[/chemical] and acted on by [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical]
affords the peculiar substance

The acid formed by the solution of the substance united to
[chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] reddened vegetable blues by its immediate contact
and soon after destroyed them
When [insertion]the new substance was[/insertion] heated in [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical] or brought in contact with red hot
[chemical]chemical_430|hyperoxymuriate of potassa[/chemical] it seemed to undergo no
change.
M. M. [person]person_008|Desormes[/person] & [person]person_398|Clement[/person] had stated that when the sub-
stance was combined with the metals metallic oxides could
be obtained from the solutions, I suspected that this de-
pended upon the presence of moisture or upon
[chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical] derived from the air and experiment justi-
fyed my suspicion
I heated the substance with Iron [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] &
Lead out of the contact of air it united to them without
any violence of action and formed compounds fusible at
a moderate heat and volatile at a higher temperature
All the compounds except that of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] which was white
were coloured of different shades of red brown, red & orange
The compound it formed with [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical] was of a deep orange
that with iron of a bright red brown that with lead a bright
orange that with [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] an orange still more ap-
proaching to red
The compounds of Iron & [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical] when exposed to an al-
kaline solution immediately deposited metallic oxides
but when I heated them in small [misc]misc_317|retorts[/misc] containing
pure [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] no such change occurred and they
combined with the [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] and formed com-
pounds which volatilized without leaving any oxides

substance formed in all its obvious sensible and chemical qualities
the same as that obtained from solutions of the substance by ni-
trate of silver
The modes which occurred to me as most likely to effect [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] de-
composition [insertion]of the substance.[/insertion] by chemical agents were the action of the highly in-
flammable metals upon it which unite to [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical]
or the action of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] which in general tends to the expulsion
of [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical] and to the separation of inflammable bases from
that principle
I heated some potassium in a little glass tube and passed
some of the substance in vapour through it [insertion]at[/insertion] the moment the
vapour came in contact with the potassium there was an in-
flammation and the potassium burnt slowly with a pale blue
light There was no gas disengaged when the experiment
was repeated in communication with a mercurial appa-
ratus
The substance formed by the action of potassium was white
fusible at a red heat and soluble in water_ It had a peculiar
acrid taste; when acted upon by [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] it effervesced.-
 & the peculiar substance appeared. [deletion] and there was a smell of [chemical]chemical_007|hydrogen[/chemical] gas. [insertion]similar to that of [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical]._[/insertion][/deletion]
It was evident that in this experiment there had been no
decomposition of the body [deletion]and that[/deletion] the result [insertion]seemed to[/insertion] depend[deletion]ed[/deletion]
merely upon the combination of it with the [chemical]chemical_031|Potassium[/chemical].-
I exposed the body to the action of [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] in a small glass
tube, it absorbed the [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] and a substance formed which was
volatile by heat and which appeared as a yellow solid. It was
soluble in water and rendered the water of a yellow green co-
lour and strongly acid; the solution when acted upon by solution
of [chemical]chemical_436|Potassa[/chemical] in excess effervesced and afforded the peculiar substance,

[page]162|MS-DAVY-11200-000-00162|dnp12154pp|79325702[/page]
to lay before the [misc]misc_883|Royal Society[/misc] an account of the investigations I have
made upon it; and I do this with the less scruple as my peculiar
manner of viewing the phenomena have led me to some new re-
sults which probably will not be considered by the society as with-
out interest in their [deletion]general application[/deletion] [insertion]relation[/insertion] to the general theory of
chemistry & in their possible application to one of the useful arts._
The first experiments [insertion]that[/insertion] I made upon this substance were to as-
 certain, whether [chemical]chemical_439|[insertion](argentane)[/insertion][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_273|Muriate of Silver[/chemical] could be formed from its so-
lution in water or alcohol, and for this purpose it was purified
by distilling it from [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical].. Its solutions I found when mixed
with [chemical]chemical_433|nitrate of silver[/chemical] deposited a dense precipitate of a pale
lemon colour; This precipitate when collected and examined
proved to be fusible at a low red heat and then became of a
red colour._ When acted upon by fuzed hydrat of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] it
was rapidly decomposed and [insertion]a[/insertion] solid [deletion]matter[/deletion] [insertion]substanc[/insertion] having all the cha-
racters of [chemical]chemical_440|oxide of silver[/chemical] was formed.. the matter soluble in water
separated by a filter and acted upon by [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] afforded
the peculiar substance
A solution of [chemical]chemical_436|Potassa[/chemical] after being boiled on the precipitate af-
forded the [deletion]same[/deletion] [insertion]peculiar[/insertion] substance when treated by the same acid.
The precipitate was much more rapidly altered by exposure
to light than the [chemical]chemical_273|Muriate of Silver[/chemical] and was evidently quite a
distinct body. [ Conceiving from the action of [chemical]chemical_436|Potassa[/chemical] upon it that
it must be a compound of the peculiar substance and silver
I endeavoured to form it directly by the combination of the two
bodies._ I introduced some of the substance into the closed end of
a small glass curved tube and placed in the upper part of it
some silver foil; I heated the foil nearly to redness and then
passed the substance [deletion]through[/deletion] [insertion]over[/insertion] it in vapour; there was an immedi-
ate action the silver was rapidly dissolved, and a red fusible sub-

oxides; that it forms a detonating compound with [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] that
it is soluble in alcohol and much more soluble in ether and that
by its action upon [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] and [insertion]upon[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] a substance having
the characters of [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] is formed. _ In this commu-
nication they offered no decided opinion respecting its nature.
[person]person_157|M. Ampere[/person] had the goodness to give me some of this substance
and M. [person]person_398|Clement[/person] having requested me to submit it to some ana-
lytical tests I made several experiments upon it, which convinced
me, that it was a new substance undecompounded, in any of
the circumstances to which I was able to expose it, and that the
acid formed in processes upon it was not [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical], but a new
acid possessing a striking resemblance to that body: :
[person]person_012|M. Gay Lussac[/person] (to whom M. [person]person_398|Clement[/person] had furnished some of the
substance and with whom he had made some experiments upon
it before the communication of his memoir,) on Monday Dec[superscript]r[/superscript]. 6 read
to the institute a paper in which he stated that the acid formed
by its action [deletion]on[/deletion] [insertion]upon[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] is a peculiar one. He mentioned se-
veral interesting particulars respecting the mode of its production
and he compared it to [chemical]chemical_313|Oxymuriatic gas[/chemical] or [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] and stated
that two hypotheses might be founded upon its nature and that
it might be considered either as an undecompounded substance or
as a compound of [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical]. [person]person_012|M. Gay Lussac[/person] is still engaged in ex-
periments on this substance and from his activity and great
sagacity a complete chemical history of it may be anticipated.
But as the mode of procuring the substance is now known to
the chemical world in general, and as the combinations and agen-
cies of it offer an extensive field for enquiries, and will probably
occupy the attention of many persons, and as the investigation of it
is not pursued by the discoverer himself, nor particularly by the gen-
tlemen to whom it was first communicated, I shall not hesitate

& Muriate of [chemical]chemical_035|soda [/chemical]& no [insertion]salt of[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] _
A new and a very curious substance has recently occupied the
attention of chemists at Paris
This substance was accidentally discovered about two years ago by
M. [person]person_676|Courtois[/person] a manufacturer of saltpetre at Paris. In his processes
for procuring soda from the ashes of sea-weeds (cendres de vareck) he
found the iron vessels employed much corroded and in searching
for the cause of this effect he made the discovery _ The substance is
procured from the ashes after the extraction of the carbonate of [chemical]chemical_035|Soda[/chemical]
with great facility and merely by the action of [deletion]the[/deletion] sulphuric
acid_ When the acid is concentrated so as to produce much
heat the substance appears as a vapour of a beautiful violet colour
which condenses in crystals having the colour and the lustre of [chemical]chemical_218|[misc]misc_194|Plumbago[/misc][/chemical]
M. [person]person_676|Courtois[/person] soon after he had discovered it gave specimens of it
to M. M. [person]person_008|Desormes[/person] & [person]person_398|Clement[/person] for chemical examination; and
those gentlemen read a short memoir upon it at a meeting
at the Institute of France on Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 29 In this memoir
These [insertion]able Chemists[/insertion] described its principal properties, they mentioned
that its specific gravity is about four times that of water, that it
becomes a violet coloured gas at a temperature below that of boil-
ing water. that it combines with the metals and with Phospho-
rus and [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] and likewise with the alkalies and metallic ox-

[page]165|MS-DAVY-11200-000-00165|dnp12157pp|79325705[/page]

& in this case it must separate
with the [insertion]first chrystals of[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_015|common salt[/chemical]_.
Whether the [deletion][insertion]peculiar[/insertion] properties[/deletion] [insertion]superiority[/insertion] which the
curers of Fish [deletion]have[/deletion] & Meat
are in the habit of attributing to
bay salt over rock salt are
at all connected with the presence
of the compounds of [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical]
is an inquiry perhaps
worth making & the results

of the composition of different
kinds of salts do not preclude

very fine; the bold cliffs & projection of

the last [underline]mother liquor[/underline] which might contain [chemical]chemical_455|[underline]Sodame[/underline][/chemical];
but it gave no unequivocal signs of [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical]. a slight

which might have occasioned this. - I burnt a sponge of this form
& very succulent. it gave much salt; but the

suffocating smell when evaporated principally rises in vapour with the water of the solu-
tion has no distinct action upon [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical] - when evaporated a solid remains which seems
to be the same substance & possesses the same power of reddening vegetable blues _ When the
mixed compound is poured into [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] a black powder falls down but there is
no effervescence, & this is the fulminating compound of I. & [chemical]chemical_017|Azote[/chemical]. & this offers perhaps the
best mode of producing [chemical]chemical_464|Azotane[/chemical]
The [chemical]chemical_438|hydroionic acid[/chemical] combines instantly with [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] without any change
and the compound produced is more pungent than the [chemical]chemical_013|muriate of ammonia[/chemical] it seems
to have nearly the same degree of volatility. [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] separates the [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical] from
the compound acid of [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical] but a brown powder is produced.

a glass tube.._ giving off [chemical]chemical_424|iodine[/chemical] which combines with the

I. Invisible radiant heat [deletion]may in[/deletion] [insertion][deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] under[/insertion] some circumstances passes
directly through glass
2. The quantity of radient heat which passes directly through
glass is so much greater [deletion]relative[/deletion] [insertion]in proportion[/insertion] [deletion]relative[/deletion] to the whole heat emitted in the
same direction, as the temperature of the source of heat is more
elevated
3. The calorific rays which have already passed through a
screen of glass, experience in passing through a second glass
screen of a similar nature, a much smaller diminution
of their intensity than they did in passing through the first
screen
4. The rays emitted by a hot body differ from each other in
their [deletion]faculty to pass[/deletion] [insertion]power of passing[/insertion] through glass.
5. A thick glass though as much or more permeable to
light than a thin glass of worse quality, allows a much smal-
ler quantity of radient heat to pass. The difference is so much
the less as the temperature of the radiating source is more ele-
vated.
6 The quantity of heat which a hot body yields in a given time
by radiation to a cold body [deletion]situated[/deletion] [insertion]placed[/insertion] at a distance, increases cae-
teris paribus, in a greater ratio than the excess of temperature

_ [nonenglish]nonenglish_263|En consultant l'analyse de Klaproth,[/nonenglish] des minerais
de tellure, nous trouverons cette proportion observée
par la nature . [nonenglish]nonenglish_268|Le weisserz contient environ 44.75 parties[/nonenglish]
de tellure , 26.75 parties d'or. 19.5 parties de [nonenglish]nonenglish_314|plomb[/nonenglish], et
8.5 parties d'[nonenglish]nonenglish_316|Argent[/nonenglish]. [nonenglish]nonenglish_269|Les quantitiés d'oxigène requises pour[/nonenglish]
changer ces metaux en oxide, sont, d'apres ce que j'in-
diquerai par la suite, pour l'or . 3.21 parties, pour le
[nonenglish]nonenglish_314|plomb[/nonenglish] 1.5. et pour l'[nonenglish]nonenglish_316|Argent[/nonenglish] 0.62 qui, prises en totalité,
forment 5.33. 44.75 de tellure prennant 11 parties d'oxigène
et 5.33 X 2 = 10.66. Le blaettererz, qui est un [nonenglish]nonenglish_314|plomb[/nonenglish] de tel-
lure, contient 32.2 parties de tellure contre 54 parties de
[nonenglish]nonenglish_314|plomb[/nonenglish]; le premier a besoin, pour son oxidation , de 7.985
d'oxigène, et le dernier de 4.18 parties, ce qui est encore
précisement le même rapport, qu'on ne peut regarder
la deviation que comme un défaut d'observation. Le
blaettererz contient encore de plus 9 parties d'or 1/2 part
d'[nonenglish]nonenglish_316|Argent[/nonenglish], 1.3 partie de [nonenglish]nonenglish_315|Cuivre[/nonenglish], et 3 parties de [nonenglish]nonenglish_310|Soufre[/nonenglish]. Le
rapport de ces trois métaux avec le [nonenglish]nonenglish_310|Soufre[/nonenglish] s'approche
de tres-pres du calcul; [nonenglish]nonenglish_273|quand, donc on réunit l'oxigène[/nonenglish]
qui est nécessaire pour produire dans le [nonenglish]nonenglish_310|Soufre[/nonenglish] de l'acide
sulfureux avec celui nécessaire pour l'oxidation du tellure, la
somme s'elevera à 10.985 : et si l'on prend ensemble les
quantités d'oxigène qui devraint etre employées par les
autres métaux pour l'oxidation, la somme sera de 5.567
qui doublée = 11.134, et par consequent presque conforme
au calcul. [nonenglish]nonenglish_274|Dans l'aurum graphicum, 60 parties de[/nonenglish]
tellure sont combinées avec 30 parties d'or et 10 d'[nonenglish]nonenglish_316|Argent[/nonenglish];
l'[chemical]chemical_022|Oxigene[/chemical] de tellure-metal serait 14.8 et celui de l'or
et de l'[nonenglish]nonenglish_316|Argent[/nonenglish] 4.34 Je presume qu'ici dans la determina-
