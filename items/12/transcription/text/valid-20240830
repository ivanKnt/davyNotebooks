In the last Bakerian lecture I [insertion]have[/insertion] hazarded a conjecture whether
the [deletion]diamond[/deletion] difference between the diamond & common
carbonaceous substances may not be owing to the presence of
some light & subtle principle [insertion]in the diamond which may be[/insertion] [deletion]which is[/deletion] expelled from it by oxygene.
[deletion]I have lately been able to put the conjecture to the[/deletion]
[deletion]test of experiment & I have ascertained that it is not[/deletion]
[deletion]founded. I have likewise been able to make some[/deletion]
[deletion]researches[/deletion] An opportunity having lately occurred to me of
putting this conjecture to the test of experiment, I
have availed myself of it [deletion]I have availed myself[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] & I have made a number of experiments
on the combustion of the diamond & of other
carbonaceous substances.- Finding [deletion]that the[/deletion] no tendencies
of the truth of [insertion]the[/insertion] above mentioned conjecture, [deletion]I undertook a minute[/deletion]
[deletion]examinations of the [unclear]fluctuation[/unclear] of gas formed in the combustion[/deletion]
[deletion]of my experiments[/deletion] I have sought for other courses

Since it has been shewn [deletion] by the experiments of M.[/deletion] [insertion]various accurate experiments[/insertion]

& certain carbonaceous substances [deletion]produce nearly the same[/deletion]
[deletion]quantity of[/deletion] consume nearly the same quantity of oxygene
in combustion & produce a gas having the same
obvious qualities a number of [deletion]suppositions[/deletion] [insertion]conjectures[/insertion] have been
formed to explain the remarkable differences in [insertion]the[/insertion] visible
[deletion]of qualities[/deletion] [insertion]properties[/insertion] of these bodies by supposing some [deletion]chemical[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] minute [deletion]chemic[/deletion] difference in their chemical
composition. - These conjectures [insertion][unclear]h[/unclear][/insertion] are [deletion]well known[/deletion] [deletion]to[/deletion] &
[deletion]the. it will be unnecessary to dwell upon them[/deletion]
been often discussed it will [insertion]not[/insertion] be necessary therefore [deletion]briefly[/deletion] to
to [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]dwell upon[/insertion] them. . .M. M. Biot & Arrago from the
high refractive power of the diamond have supposed that
it may contain [deletion]oxyg[/deletion] Hydrogene. I ventured to [deletion]suppose[/deletion] [insertion]suggest[/insertion]
in my third Bakerian Lecture from the circumstance
of its non conducting power & from the action of
Potassium upon it that it m[deletion]ight[/deletion]ay contain a minute
proportion of oxygene & in my last Bakerian lecture
I have hazarded the idea that it may [deletion]contain[/deletion]
be the carbonaceous principle combined with some light
& subtile element that may be expelled from it by
oxygene. - M. Guyton de Morveau who conceived He
had proved by experiments 12 years ago that
common carbonaceous substances are oxides of Diamond; from
his last researches [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] still[/deletion] conducted in the same
manner as those of Mess. M.' Allen & Pepys
seems still inclined to adopt this opinion

though in admitting a [deletion]minute[/deletion] [insertion]much smaller[/insertion] quantity of oxygene [deletion][unclear]only[/unclear][/deletion] there
[insertion]the impurities supplied in charcoal [/insertion]are [deletion]carbon carbonaceous substances[/deletion] & He considers the
diamond as pure carbonaceous matter, containing [deletion]only a[/deletion] possibly
[deletion]a minute quantity[/deletion] [insertion]some atoms[/insertion] of water of chrystallization -
I have long [deletion]been desirous[/deletion] [insertion]had a desire[/insertion] of making some new experiments on
the [deletion]products of[/deletion] the combustion of the diamond & other carbonaceous
Substances & this desire [deletion]has been[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] increased by the new [insertion]lately ascertained[/insertion] facts [deletion]supposed[/deletion]
[deletion]afforded by the combinations of[/deletion] [insertion]with respect to[/insertion] iodine, which [deletion]gives an acid[/deletion] [insertion]by uniting to[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion]
Hydrogene [insertion]affords an acid[/insertion] so analogous to Muriatic acid that it was for
[deletion]quite[/deletion] some time confounded with that substance . . My objects [insertion]in these experiments[/insertion] were
to examine minutely whether any matter was separated from the
diamond [deletion]or carbonaceous substances[/deletion] during [insertion]its[/insertion] combustion & to
determine whether [deletion]in all its characters[/deletion] [insertion]the gases[/insertion] formed in this process
was precisely the same in [insertion]its minute[/insertion] chemical nature, [insertion]as[/insertion] that
formed in the combustion of common charcoal.

- In the very first [deletion]process[/deletion] [insertion]trials[/insertion] on the combustion of

[deletion]which enabled me to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] adopt [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] a very[/deletion] [insertion]that I believe has not been noticed before[/insertion]
[deletion]simple apparatus & very easy methods[/deletion] of
[deletion]operating in my inquiries were after [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
namely that the diamond when strongly ignited
by the [insertion]great in[/insertion] lens in a [insertion]thin[/insertion] capsule of platina perforated
[insertion]with many[/insertion] orifices so as to admit a free circulation
of air continued to burn in oxygene give[superscript]*[/superscript] [deletion]with[/deletion]
[deletion]great brilliancy[/deletion] after being withdrawn from
the focus -.: The light it affords is steady
& of so brilliant a red as to be visible
in the brightest sunshine & the heat produced
is so great that in one experiment
in which three fragments of diamond weighing
only 1 grain 9/10 were burnt a fine wire of platina
used for attaching them to the [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]capsule[/insertion] was fused &
that some time after the diamond was
removed out of the focus.-
-The knowledge of this circumstance [deletion]enabled[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]afforded[/deletion] enabled[/insertion] me [deletion]to [unclear]meas[/unclear][/deletion]
to [deletion]adopt a[/deletion] [insertion]employ a[/insertion] very simple [deletion]method of chemistry[/deletion] apparatus

the globe containing the [insertion]capsule [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] & the [deletion]object of[/deletion] substance to be burnt[/insertion] [deletion]diamond[/deletion] was exhausted by

globe before & after the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was brought to the

gas had remained -. And as during the short time
required for the combustion there was no sensible
change either in the thermometer or Barometer
no corrections for pressure or temperature were
considered necessary -. The change of volume
in the gas after the combustion was estimated
by means of a fine tube connected with a
stop cock adapted by a female screw to the
stop cock of the globe & the absorption was
judged of by the quantity of mercury that
that entered the tube. [insertion]which affords means [insertion]a measure[/insertion] so exact that [deletion][unclear]no[/unclear] change[/deletion] [insertion]an alteration[/insertion] however minute could be overlooked.[/insertion] As the [deletion]strength[/deletion] elastic

1814 .May 24. Returned to Rome this day After a very
interesting journey to Naples & Pestum. _ We left Rome. Saturday 12.
of May._ . . The first part of the Road was over Volcanic matters
till we reached the Pontine marshes. Where the Appenines burst
upon us in mountain greatness & beauty of form.- La Cava
the Alban Mount, the Lake of Nemi & the territory in the
neighborhood of [underline]Rome[/underline] is volcanic, the Tufa is a species of
[underline]Travertine[/underline], decomposed Basaltic Rocks or patzolana cemented
by calcareous cement from [underline]Water[/underline] impregnated with Carbonic
acid; The Appenines are all calcareous, stratified
their bases covered with Travertine.- Not far
from la Caserta. We met again the Volcanic district
which reaches to the feet of Vesuvius; but the
mountains on the other side the Bay of Naples are
calcareous _ & [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] all the mountains along the Coast to
Pestum are of the same kind . at the foot of these
mountains appear in many cases formations of
Travertine. From the waters descending from the Appenines
-one [place]place_705|river[/place] which we crossed by a Boat 4 miles from
Pestum was celebrated by the ancients for its petrifying
qualities - The plain in which Pestum stands. is
formed of travertine; A little lake or tarn near
the ancient gate with recent depositions I took some of
the water of this lake of which 4 cubical inches evaporated
left 4.9 grains.
- Pestum is a very interesting spot; the Ruins of the
3 [deletion]xx[/deletion] temples very magnificent._ . Here, Grecian art of the
elder time is seen very little impaired whilst the [underline]Roman[/underline]
city has passed away. - I suppose the columns are about
25 feet high in the temples of Neptune -the most ancient
Doric._ & all of travertine. a stone probably foraged

- The base of the limestone hills of the Appenines between
[deletion]the[/deletion] Vesuvius & Pestum._ are all cloathed with the most
beautiful vegetation [deletion]Vine[/deletion]Vines that ascend to the very
top of elms. corn or flax beneath & in some
sheltered glens orange & lemon trees._ It seems as if
this soil is favorable to culture. _ The indian corn grows here
but as yet was not half a foot high & no corn as yet
has changed colour -
_ I saw Vesuvius from a spot about two miles above
Pompeia & never behelt a more magnificent prospect than
this presents . _ Naples rising in majesty above the sea
The Hill of Pausillipo above it, Capria stretched below
my feet Ischia blue in the distance, & the promontory

-: There is very little chrystalized lava in the neighborhood
of Vesuvius but the ancient lava [deletion]is[/deletion] below the modern
contains a great variety of chrystalized substances
in one specimen in possession of Montecolli I saw basaltic
hornblende, sienite & Mica; or at least thin plates exactly
resembling mica._ These lavas likewise present distinct
chrystals of Hornblende & feld spar; & in summer
there is an immense mass of lava of this kind
if that can be called lava which has been
fused under great pressure & probably cooled out
of the contact of air.
The fumes which constantly rise from the crater of Vesuvius
are water probably the depositions from the air. & muriatic
acid vapour_. near the crater there is a strong smell
of sulphureous acid._ The yellow matter which might be
mistaken for sulphur is iron dissolved from the lava by
the muriatic acid gas & water. I saw no sulphur on any
part of the crater that I examined; [deletion]xx xx[/deletion] In the night we
saw the flame issuing out of [insertion]the aperture in the upper part of[/insertion] the crater with immense violence
& noise & amazing colums of smoke the light was
red like that of a common bonfire; the products
apparently elastic matter water & sulphureus acid &
carbonic acid_ No dust alkaline or earths. -- Do not the

of Marble are eat into by . Zoophytes or Shell
fish a most singular fact - three or four feet
of each column _ I am strongly inclined to suppose
that they belonged to a more ancient temple
which had been buried in the sand & that
they had been dug out & removed by the
romans to where they now stand, for
there are no other proofs of the change
of land into sea & of sea into land.

None of the recent lavas that I have seen are
very interesting; they appear to have been considerably
cooled before they were poured forth & contain
an immense quantity of mechanical [deletion]de[/deletion] mixtures, _
- I have observed no regular chrystals in any of them
except of the oligistic iron ore. which seems
to be a sort of accretion from the
lava at the time it was still soft.

is a gaseous compound of Chlorine & Phosphorus

in enormous quantities & seems to form with it
an highly volatile [underline]triple compound[/underline] of a deep
orange colour & which gives an orange gas __
- [underline]Sulphurane[/underline] dissolves iodine & gives a purple
liquor which yeilds a purple vapour, & which
when acted on by water yeilds Sulp[superscript]c[/superscript] acid (probably)
& a whitish substance which seems to be a
compound of sulphur & iodine, from which iodine
rose when it was heated & that in considerable
quantities.
- The Sublimate Phosphoran[unclear]ce[/unclear]. became yellow
by the action of Iodine . but had not that
striking effect upon it. which Phosphorane had
& the solution of Phosphorus in Phosphorane
- When [deletion]the[/deletion] water was added to the fluid
compound of Phosphorus saturated with chlorine
& iodine the fluid [deletion]became[/deletion] dissolved in it

[deletion]I have made a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with[/deletion]
[deletion]the hope of determining the cause of[/deletion]
When I first discovered that these compounds
[deletion]Was[/deletion] in a state of [deletion]p[/deletion]Purity dissolved in
acids without effervescence, I [deletion]concluded[/deletion]
thought it probably that the effect
depended upon the formation of
a compound of oxygene & iodine similar
to Euchlorine, or the oxychloric acid
& which remained dissolved in the [deletion]liquor[/deletion]
fluid; & on this idea I made
a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with the hope
of obtaining such a combination in
a detached form.__
I distilled the solution of the
triple compound [insertion]of Potassium[/insertion] sol Sulphuric acid
but the only gaseous product[deletion]s[/deletion] I obtained
was oxygen [deletion]&[/deletion] sulphuric acid & iodine
condensed in the cool part of the
apparatus & the residuum was
acid sulphate of Potassa.--

& left sulphate of Baryt [unclear][deletion]es[/deletion]a[/unclear]
_ When the solid triple compound of
Baryta was [deletion]iodine by[/deletion] [insertion]heated in[/insertion] by very small quantities
of diluted sulphuric acid; [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] the fluid
separated [deletion]by the filter; it[/deletion] exhibited acid

[deletion]of sulphuric acid yeilded iodine &[/deletion] [insertion]results as the fluid the same just mentioned[/insertion]
[deletion]oxygene & left a residuum which[/deletion]
[deletion]was sulphate of Baryta__[/deletion]
The [insertion]residual[/insertion] solid matter obtained by the action
of sulphuric acid on the triple compound
of Barium was treated a second time
with sulphuric yet notwithstanding
[deletion]after[/deletion] when heated to redness it yeilded
iodine in abundance.
I have repeated these experiments very

[page]138|MS-DAVY-11200-000-00138|dnp12134pp|79325682[/page]
often because M. Gay Lussac has stated
that an [deletion]peculiar[/deletion] acid compound of
oxygene & iodine may be procured
by dropping sulphuric acid into a solution
of the triple compound of [deletion]iodine[/deletion] Barium;
but his conclusions seem to have been founded
upon the want of effervescence in the process
& his experiments were made at a very early
period of the investigation & immediately after
I had discovered the triple compounds. & before
I had obtained them in a state of purity
- It [underline]is possible[/underline] that a binary compound
of iodine & oxygene may exist in the
solutions of the triple compounds in
acids yet there are [deletion]some[/deletion] circumstances
opposed to the idea, From the analogy between
[deletion]of[/deletion] chlorine & iodine it might have
been expected that [deletion]such a[/deletion] [insertion]such[/insertion] compound would
be coloured & would [insertion]ultimately[/insertion] destroy vegetable colour
but the solutions of the triple compounds in
acids are always free from colour
& do not act upon blue solutions of
indigo unless they are decomposed by
heat So as to evolve iodine_
Where small quantities of very diluted
sulphuric acid are digested on the
triple compounds of Potassium & Barium

[page]139|MS-DAVY-11200-000-00139|dnp12135pp|79325683[/page]
135
the fluid obtained is always acid & always
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] precipitates muriate of Baryta
- I thought it possible that the compound
of iodine & oxygene might possess this
property [deletion]as [insertion]it belongs to[/insertion] the oxychloric acid[/deletion]
but on collecting the precipitate
& examining it it had the character
of sulphate of Baryta, - & from
all the facts it appears that
in the action of acids upon the
triple compound[deletion]s[/deletion] new combinations
only were formed.
I take the liberty of proposing for
the triple compounds the names of oxyiodes
because when decomposed by heat they afford
oxygene & iodine. Individually they
may be named from their bases_ Thus
oxypotassame or oxyiode of Potassium
will signify the triple compound
of Potassium oxygene & iodine, &
oxybarame or oxyiode of Barium
will denote the triple compound
of Barium.___

of the gas by distilling it with a new quantity of the substance
nor more gas from the fusible compound by distilling it with
a new quantity of phosphorus
When the fusible [insertion]compound of the[/insertion] substance [insertion]with Phosphorus[/insertion] is distilled with a small quan-
tity of water the gas produced seems to be of the same kind
as that produced by the action of heat [deletion]on[/deletion] [insertion]during[/insertion] the com[deletion][unclear]pressed[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]bination[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion]
[deletion]phosphorus and the substance[/deletion], and both these gasses ab-
sorbed by water afforded when acted on by nitrate of sil-
ver the same product as that formed by the action of a so-
lution of the substance in water on the same salt
I attempted to form a compound of the substance with
hydrogen directly by heating it in several experiments to
redness in glass tubes filled with hydrogen. When the gas
was moist or when the [deletion]fluid[/deletion] [insertion]tube[/insertion] contained vapour a strong
acid fluid was formed of a yellow colour._ When the gas &
the substance were dry there was an expansion of volume
and on breaking the tube, fumes appeared similar to those
produced by the action of the gas formed during the union
of phosphorus with the substance and which precipitated
in the same manner a solution of (nitrate of) silver
I have however never been able to destroy the whole quantity
of hydrogen employed in this experiment and at the highest
temperatures which can be applied to glass the action of the
hydrogen on the substance is very slow and cannot be com-
pared to its action on chlorine or oxygene._

when the difficultly soluble substance is acted on by a small
quantity of water and heated in a glass tube much gas
spontaneously inflammable is disengaged and a white
sublimate rises which when acted on by cold water [insertion]becomes hot &[/insertion] af-
fords a considerable quantity of a gas having all the proper-
ties of hydro-phosphoric [deletion]acid[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_435|gas.[/chemical]
The solution of this [insertion]chrystal[/insertion] substance in water neutralized by
Potassa and decomposed by sulphuric acid afforded the
peculiar substance[deletion]s[/deletion] but when the solution was heated
strongly [insertion]before its neutralization[/insertion] it left only hydro-phosphorus acid which when
heated gave off hydrophoric gas and became phosphoric
acid
It is easy to explain all these phenomena except the pro-
duction of the acid gas which [deletion]appears[/deletion] [insertion]seems[/insertion] to be a compound
of the peculiar substance and hydrogene To account for
the appearance of this body is necessary to suppose the exist-
ance of hydrogene or of water in the substance or of hydro-
gene in phosphorus
I used the substance distilled through quick lime
which there is every reason to believe would absorb
all the water united to it but still the acid gas which
gave [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx xx[/unclear] because of[/deletion] hydrogene when decomposed
by mercury was produced._ I am inclined to attri-
bute the phenomenon to the action of hydrogen, con-
tained in the phosphorus and former experiments-
that I have made on phosphorus by voltaic electricity
prove the existence of hydrogene in this substance._ The
quantity of acid gas produced likewise is always small &
limited and I have never been able to produce from the
fixed compound of the substance with phosphorus more of

producing heat without light, small quantities of a strongly
acid gas generally arise from the mixture, and by the ap-
plication of heat it is produced in greater quantities. When
the substance is in excess an easily fusible and volatile com-
pound of a red colour is obtained. When the phosphorus
is in excess the greater part of the product is more fixed._
I examined the gaseous acid formed by the action of
phosphorus on the substance with attention . it gives
dense white fumes by combining with the aqueous
vapours in the air. It has a smell very [deletion]analogous[/deletion] [insertion]similar[/insertion] to
that of the solid compound of chlorine and phospho-
rus [insertion]which itself is very analogous to that of Muriatic acid. _[/insertion] It is rapidly absorbed by water When made to act
upon ammonia it forms with it a dense white salt which
when acted on by sulphuric acid affords the peculiar sub-
stance and at the same time a smell of hydrogene is
perceived. When mercury is heated in it the same com-
pound as that produced by the action of the new substance
directly upon mercury is formed and hydrogen is disen-
gaged. When Potassium is made to act upon it there is no
inflammation as in muriatic acid gas but the potassium
becomes converted into a body similar to that produced by
its combustion in the vapour of the substance and a gas
which burns in the same manner as hydrogene is disen-
gaged._
When the easily fusible and volatile compound of the
substance with phosphorus is heated in water it rapidly
dissolves in it and forms a strong acid which when eva-
porated leaves [insertion]hydrophosphorous[/insertion] acid and which before its evapora-
tion neutralized by potassa and acted on by sulphuric acid
affords the peculiar substance

[page]156|MS-DAVY-11200-000-00156|dnp12152pp|79325700[/page]
The acid formed by the solution of the substance united to
chlorine reddened vegetable blues by its immediate contact
and soon after destroyed them
When [insertion]the new substance was[/insertion] heated in oxygen or brought in contact with red hot
hyperoxymuriate of potassa it seemed to undergo no
change.
M. M. Desormes & Clement had stated that when the sub-
stance was combined with the metals metallic oxides could
be obtained from the solutions, I suspected that this de-
pended upon the presence of moisture or upon
oxygen derived from the air and experiment justi-
fyed my suspicion
I heated the substance with Iron Mercury Tin Zinc &
Lead out of the contact of air it united to them without
any violence of action and formed compounds fusible at
a moderate heat and volatile at a higher temperature
All the compounds except that of zinc which was white
were coloured of different shades of red brown, red & orange
The compound it formed with tin was of a deep orange
that with iron of a brightened brown that with lead a bright
orange that with mercury an orange still more ap-
proaching to red
The compounds of Iron & Tin when exposed to an al-
kaline solution immediately deposited metallic oxides
but when I heated them in small retorts containing
pure ammonia no such change occurred and they
combined with the ammonia and formed com-
pounds which volatilized without leaving any oxides
When the substance is made to act upon phosphorus
they [insertion]two bodies[/insertion] combine with great rapidity at common temperatures,

substance formed in all its obvious sensible and chemical qualities
the same as that obtained from solutions of the substance by ni-
trate of silver
The modes which occurred to me as most likely to effect [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] de-
composition [insertion]of the substance.[/insertion] by chemical agents were the action of the highly in-
flammable metals upon it which unite to oxygen and chlorine
or the action of chlorine which in general tends to the expulsion
of oxygen and to the separation of inflammable bases from
that principle
I heated some potassium in a little glass tube and passed
some of the substance in vapour through it [insertion]at[/insertion] the moment the
vapour came in contact with the potassium there was an in-
flammation and the potassium burnt slowly with a pale blue
light There was no gas disengaged when the experiment
was repeated in communication with a mercurial appa-
ratus
The substance formed by the action of potassium was white
fusible at a red heat and soluble in water_ It had a peculiar
acrid taste; when acted upon by sulphuric acid it effervesced.-
 & the peculiar substance appeared. [deletion] and there was a sensible [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]green-[/deletion]
[deletion]dry gas. [insertion]similar to that of muriatic acid._[/insertion][/deletion]
It was evident that in this experiment there had been no
decomposition of the body [deletion]and that[/deletion] the result [insertion]seemed to[/insertion] depend[deletion]ed[/deletion]
merely upon the combination of it with the potassium.-
I exposed the body to the action of chlorine in a small glass
tube, it absorbed the chlorine and a substance formed which was
volatile by heat and which appeared as a yellow solid. It was
soluble in water and rendered the water of a yellow green co-
lour and strongly acid; the solution when acted upon by solution
of potassa in excess effervesced and afforded the peculiar substance,

to lay before the Royal Society an account of the investigations I have
made upon it; and I do this with the less scruple as my peculiar
manner of viewing the phenomena have led me to some new re-
sults which probably will not be considered by the society as with-
out interest in their [deletion]general application[/deletion] [insertion]relation[/insertion] to the general theory of
chemistry & in their possible application to one of the useful arts._
The first experiments [insertion]that[/insertion] I made upon this substance were to as-
 certain, whether [insertion](argentane)[/insertion] muriate of silver could be formed from its so-
lution in water or alcohol, and for this purpose it was purified
by distilling it from lime.. Its solutions I found when mixed
with nitrate of silver deposited a dense precipitate of a pale
lemon colour; This precipitate when collected and examined
proved to be fusible at a low red heat and then became of a
red colour._ When acted upon by fuzed hydrat of potash it
was rapidly decomposed and [insertion]a[/insertion] solid [deletion]matter[/deletion] [insertion]substanc[/insertion] having all the cha-
racters of oxide of silver was formed.. the matter soluble in water
separated by a filter and acted upon by sulphuric acid afforded
the peculiar substance
A solution of potassa after being boiled on the precipitate af-
forded the [deletion]same[/deletion] [insertion]peculiar[/insertion] substance when treated by the same acid.
The precipitate was much more rapidly altered by exposure
to light than the muriate of silver and was evidently quite a
distinct body. [ Conceiving from the action of potassa upon it that
it must be a compound of the peculiar substance and silver
I endeavoured to form it directly by the combination of the two
bodies._ I introduced some of the substance into the closed end of
a small glass curved tube and placed in the upper part of it
some silver foil; I heated the foil nearly to redness and then
passed the substance [deletion]through[/deletion] [insertion]over[/insertion] it in vapour; there was an immedi-
ate action the silver was rapidly dissolved, and a red fusible sub-

oxides; that it forms a detonating compound with ammonia that
it is soluble in alcohol and much more soluble in ether and that
by its action upon phosphorus and [insertion]upon[/insertion] hydrogene a substance having
the characters of Muriatic acid is formed. _ In this commu-
nication they offered no decided opinion respecting its nature.
M. Ampere had the goodness to give me some of this substance
and M. Clement having requested me to submit it to some ana-
lytical tests I made several experiments upon it, which convinced
me, that it was a new substance undecompounded, in any of
the circumstances to which I was able to expose it, and that the
acid formed in the processes upon it was not muriatic acid, but a new
acid possessing a striking resemblance to that body: :
M. Gay Lussac (to whom M. Clement had furnished some of the
substance and with whom he had made some experiments upon
it before the communication of his memoir,) on Monday Dec[superscript]r[/superscript]. 6 read
to the institute a paper in which he stated that the acid formed
by its action [deletion]on[/deletion] [insertion]upon[/insertion] hydrogene is a peculiar one. He mentioned se-
veral interesting particulars respecting the mode of its production
and he compared it to oxymuriatic gas or chlorine and stated
that two hypotheses might be founded upon its nature and that
it might be considered either as an undecompounded substance or
as a compound of oxygen. M. Gay Lussac is still engaged in ex-
periments on this substance and from his activity and great
sagacity a complete chemical history of it may be anticipated.
But as the mode of procuring the substance is now known to
the chemical world in general, and as the combinations and agen-
cies of it offer an extensive field for enquiries, and will probably
occupy the attention of many persons, and as the investigation of it
is not pursued by the discoverer himself, nor particularly by the gen-
tlemen to whom it was first communicated, I shall not hesitate

15 Grains of salt from Lake Albura gave 5 1/2 of
carbonate of lime: The solution evaporated
afforded 6.5 grains, principally sulphates of Potassa
& Muriate of Soda & no [insertion]salt of[/insertion] magnesia _
A new and a very curious substance has recently occupied the
attention of chemists at Paris
This substance was accidentally discovered about two years ago by
M. Courtois a manufacturer of saltpetre at Paris. In his processes
for procuring soda from the ashes of sea-weeds (cendres de vareck) he
found the iron vessels employed much corroded and in searching
for the cause of this effect he made the discovery _ The substance is
procured from the ashes after the extraction of the carbonate of soda
with great facility and merely by the action of [deletion]the[/deletion] sulphuric
acid_ When the acid is concentrated so as to produce much
heat the substance appears as a vapour of a beautiful violet colour
which condenses in crystals having the colour and the lustre of
plumbago.
M. Courtois soon after he had discovered it gave specimens of it
to M. M. Desormes & Clement for chemical examination; and

I made a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on [underline]Iodine[/underline].
& others on the Torpedo & on the decomposition
of the fluates.
- I found that when [underline]Muriate[/underline] of Baryta was
mixed with [underline]Potassame[/underline] there was a slight preicpitate
but on evaporating there seemed to be no
muriate of Pot: formed & both substances fused together
& were decomposed by sulphuric acid giving Iodine
& Muriatic acid. When Muriate of Magnesia
& Muriate of lime were mixed with Potassa[underline]m[/underline]e
there were slight precipitates & it seems that
a decomposition had taken place for on
distilling to dryness [underline]Iodine[/underline] rose in vapour.
in distilling the mixture from [underline]M.lime[/underline] in
a close vessel there was fusion, with much
effervescence & [underline]iodine[/underline] rose, quere was
not water present & hydrogene produced.
- When Potassa was heated with Boracic
acid it gave a yellow glass which was
partly soluble in water & had no
alkaline properties & from this glass [underline]iodine[/underline]
& Boracic acid were produced by Sulphuric
acid._

in fusion there seemed to be a
combination [insertion]with slight effervescence[/insertion] but the alkaline property
still remained in the [underline]mixture[/underline] which when

I. Invisible radiant heat [deletion]may in[/deletion] [insertion][deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] under[/insertion] some circumstances passes
directly through glass
2. The quantity of radient heat which passes directly through
glass is so much greater [deletion]relative[/deletion] [insertion]in proportion[/insertion] [deletion]relative[/deletion] to the whole heat emitted in the
same direction, as the temperature of the source of heat is more
elevated
3. The calorific rays which have already passed through a
screen of glass, experience in passing through a second glass
screen of a similar nature, a much smaller diminution
of their intensity than they did in passing through the first
screen
4. The rays emitted by a hot body differ from each other in
their [deletion]faculty to pass[/deletion] [insertion]power of passing[/insertion] through glass.
5. A thick glass though as much or more permeable to
light than a thin glass of worse quality, allows a much smal-
ler quantity of radient heat to pass. The difference is so much
the less as the temperature of the radiating source is more ele-
vated.
6 The quantity of heat which a hot body yields in a given time
by radiation to a cold body [deletion]situated[/deletion] [insertion]placed[/insertion] at a distance, increases cae-
teris paribus, in a greater ratio than the excess of temperature
of the first body over the second.

_ En consultant l'analyse de Klaproth, des minerais
de tellure, nous trouverons cette proportion observée
par la nature . Le weisserz contient environ 44.75 parties
de tellure , 26.75 parties d'or. 19.5 parties de plomb, et
8.5 parties d'argent. Les quantitiés d'oxigène requises pour
changer ces metaux en oxide, sont, d'apres ce que j'in-
diquerai par la suite, pour l'or . 3.21 parties, pour le
plomb 1.5. et pour l'argent 0.62 qui, prises en totalité,
forment 5.33. 44.75 de tellure prennant 11 parties d'oxigène
et 5.33 X 2 = 10.66. Le blaettererz, qui est un plomb de tel-
lure, contient 32.2 parties de tellure contre 54 parties de
plomb; le premier a besoin, pour son oxidation , de 7.985
d'oxigène, et le dernier de 4.18 parties, ce qui est encore
précisement le même rapport, qu'on ne peut regarder
la deviation que comme un défaut d'observation. Le
blaettererz contient encore de plus 9 parties d'or 1/2 part
d'argent, 1.3 partie de cuivre, et 3 parties de soufre. Le
rapport de ces trois métaux avec le soufre s'approche
de tres-pres du calcul; quand, donc on réunit l'oxigène
qui est nécessaire pour produire dans le soufre de l'acide
sulfureux avec celui nécessaire pour l'oxidation du tellure, la
somme s'elevera à 10.985 : et si l'on prend ensemble les
quantités d'oxigène qui devraint etre employées par les
autres métaux pour l'oxidation, la somme sera de 5.567
qui doublée = 11.134, et par consequent presque conforme
au calcul. Dans l'aurum graphicum, 60 parties de
tellure sont combinées avec 30 parties d'or et 10 d'argent;
l'oxigene de tellure-metal serait 14.8 et celui de l'or
et de l'argent 4.34 Je presume qu'ici dans la determina-
tion de l'analyse, il s'est glisse une petite faute et que

by S[superscript]r[/superscript]. H. Davy.
M. M. Gay Lussac & Thenard have stated [insertion]in their physical & chemical researches[/insertion] that
when solutions of Zircone, Ittria or Glucine [deletion]are mixed[/deletion]
[deletion]in[/deletion] Muriatic acid is mixed with a solution of
Potassa in fluoric acid the [deletion]mixture[/deletion] [insertion]fluid produced[/insertion] exhibits
alkaline properties, even [deletion]though[/deletion] [insertion]when[/insertion] both the solutions
employed were previously slightly acid. They likewise
state that the precipitates obtained exhibit
no [deletion]alkaline[/deletion] [insertion]acid[/insertion] properties & they mention the fact
as an exception to the general law of
the [insertion]double[/insertion] decomposition of neutral [insertion]salts[/insertion] in which the
 resulting [deletion]instances[/deletion] [insertion]solutions[/insertion] [deletion]are likewise always neutral[/deletion]
exhibit the neutral the acid or the alkaline

[deletion]of determinate proportions as one calculated[/deletion]

The work of culture & the leafless vine
And the green meadow where the torrents sleep
Or moves obedient to the wants of man
