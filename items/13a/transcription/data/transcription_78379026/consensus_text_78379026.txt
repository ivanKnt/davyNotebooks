 Thou to whom heaven its noblest gifts assigned
Blest Friend of Man, the darling of mankind,
Elect of Science on whose infant head
Truth's angel power the full orb'd Halo spread,
Awhile farewell - awhile in Freedom roam,
Far from the peopled walls, the vocal dome
To distant cliffs on whose hoar hermit brow
The passing clouds like pilgrims lowly bow
Or, some green silent dell amid the hills,
Where rolls the music of unhaunted rills,
Some bank that scarce the travelled wild bee [insertion]knows[/insertion]
Where the lone night bird's song responseless flows.
And the sweet south, his destined course delayed
Sleeps in the fragrant bud or dewy blade
Go Thou, nor scorn this simple wreath to wear
Though thine the brighter laurel never sere
Though carved in Adamant, thy honoured name
Lives in the ark of ages, lives to Fame.
Farewell - thy form shall  [unclear]fame's[/unclear] eye pursue
With prayers, with vows, with wishes ever true,
And ah! if aught of good or bliss impart
 The benedictions of a faithful heart,
Truth's angel power the full orb'd Halo spread
