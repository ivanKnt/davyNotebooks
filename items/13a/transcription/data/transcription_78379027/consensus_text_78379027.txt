If sorcery divine or holy spell
In the firm pledge of souls devoted dwells
When, breathed thy name in consecrated sighs 
From bosoms pure, the orisons arise,
Then, thou [underline]thrice blest[/underline] a charmed life shall bear
To Earth, to Heaven, to Man, to Demon dear;
Then no fiend, no harpy [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of pain
Thy threshold blast, thy mansion's peace profane,
Nor care, the beldam care, shall haunt thy way
Nor on thy breast, her touch unhallowed lay
That wan and withering palm in which all [unclear]xxxxx xxx[/unclear]
Along thy path may fruits autumnal spread,
Whilst vernal blossoms, spring beneath thy tread,
Still to thine eye, Life's green [unclear]-end[/unclear] joy expand
While bends the purple vintage to thy hand.-
To thine own sphere, to nature's temple, go
[unclear]Pause[/unclear], at her Altar pause, with reverence low
The one great Spirit [underline]Truth[/underline], invoke, adore.
And hymns of praise, of holy rapture pour,
For [underline]Thee[/underline], the secret portal open flies, }
Free to thy feet the sanctuary lies, }
And the veils' wavy folds, the [unclear]mystic[/unclear] folds [unclear]eues[/unclear]
