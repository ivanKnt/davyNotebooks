Be
Beloved of Heaven! for Thee, be formed the bower
Of leaves impervious to the solar power,
Where scare the [unclear]arrowy[/unclear] beam may glide between
The rude arcade of deepest, densest green,
Where as in Eden's blissful shade of rest
When Man held converse with an angel guest,
Mayest Thou embosomed in thy still retreat,
The blue eyed cherub contemplation greet.
There muse intent on Nature's spotless page
To some a blank, but to the inspired sage,
The book of Life, where Love & Wisdom shine
The almighty thought "creation's type" divine.
Go with truth's wand, the giant shades arrest
That linger on the mountain's sinewy breast,
And mid sepulchral rocks that proudly stand,
The Pyramids unwrought of mortal hand,
Mid ruins sanctified by elder time
When rose the spirit of the floods sublime
Draw from the dusky ore, the silent stone
The ancient records of a world unknown,
Doth from the seaborn base, oblivion's wave
Redeem the chart of ages, from the grave.
