Or will then by a purer spirit led
Philanthropy - the grassy woodlands tread,
What time the Lark, harmonical herald! hails
His minstrel brethren of the woods & dales,
When hasting from the dewy tents away
From hill to hill swift flies the golden day,
At living Nature's "rich mysterious shrine"
Detect the unwrought vegetable mine,
With chemic care, the shining furrows trace
And scatter blessings on the human race.-
Yet here - though sweet the scene forbear to stay
A different region claims thy potent sway
A new creation, by thy forming [deletion][unclear]skill[/deletion][/unclear] will
From chaos called, to thee obedient still,
Where dwells thy voice on beauty's raptured ear
Experience listens, Folly drops her sneer
Ah! not to sadness, to regret resign
This infant Orb of science, only thine.
For absent Thou - what friendly spirit calls
To this dark roof - these desolated walls,
