Vain then the philosophic tube, & vain
The vase of Science or pierian strain
For [underline]thee[/underline], [underline]the Absent[/underline], roams the restless eye}
To thee reverts the ever vagrant sigh}
Unkindled by thy breath the flames of science dies}
Soul of that World! which at thy word arose
That word which artless as persuasive flows
Home to no sovereign - to no palace known
The minister of Nature's power alone,
Ah here without a crown or empire reign
The Heart thy throne -- the mind thy pure domain
Unsceptred Chief! here reign by Heaven designed
To conquer Folly & to bless Mankind "
[underline]Fidelissima[/underline]
