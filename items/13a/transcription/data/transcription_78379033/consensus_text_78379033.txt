Oh! were I rich in nature's lore
For [underline]Him[/underline] I would her worlds explore
For Him with pious avarice sweep
The treasures of the mineral deep
And steal the starry gems that throw
Pale lustre o'er the realms below
Sweet were each care & soft each toil
If once rewarded with his smile.
And cheaply all could I resign
If but [underline]his[/underline] hand [underline]received[/underline] from mine
But me alas! the fates unkind
Within a narrow sphere confined,
No fortune hailed my natal hour
No wisdom gave her favored dower.
Go, thou, unformed by venal hand
Thy destin'd Lord's acceptance due
And with thee take this last adieu;
