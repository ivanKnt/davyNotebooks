And if a gentle heart he bear
A Heart to gentle spirits dear,
Then shall he to a stranger's prayer
Consent a stranger's pledge to wear,
And, ah, these conscious eyes again
Shall heal the tributary chain
Oh Thou! whose influence oft hath blest
This little world within my heart,
Whose image gilds the pensive hour
Of fancy's vision-weaving power,
Though, nought this gift so simple boast
And but some sighs the giver cost
Yet oh with smile benignant deign
These links to touch, to wear this chain
And if ( as I Fame the unwilling ear
Informed ) a softer chain Thou bear,
Then may no darkling shade destroy
The fabric of thy promised joy,
And may all spirits blest & good
Unseen who haunt on wave or wood
Eternal nature's sportive train
On Thee "sweet influences rain"
