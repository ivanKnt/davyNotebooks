And breathe a sense no words impart
Well augured of the thrilling heart
But if with rigid scowl severe
My lowly suit thou shame to hear,
My simple gift if Thou disdain
All seek reckless of another's pain,
Not long they stream of bliss shall flow
Nor long thy touch of rapture glow,
Who from the lips of asking child
Withholds the fragrant blossom wild,
Who from the wretched captives' power
Uproots the solitary flower,
Whose [unclear]contumely[/unclear] blasts the sighs
That from the guileless bosom rise
Oh not for him Love's hallowed Urn
The golden light of life shall beam
Oh not for him the aethereal flame
That quivers through the feeling frame;
Inert, dull, earthly in the mould
That bears an iron bosom cold.-
