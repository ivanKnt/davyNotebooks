Oh yield then to a guiltless prayer,
The simple chain consent to wear
That chain accepted let me view
Then look a long & sad adieu.
And oft the dewy skies beneath
When all of peace of love shall breathe,
Off in some cloud that sails serene
Alone in heaven's blue ocean seen,
When slow the paly shadows glide
The violets' perfumed bank beside
And their sweet buds the flowrets close
And wakes the heart, while all repose
Oft can from air, they form, they face
Thy shape, thy last, last look retrace
And with a grateful tear again
Review the consecrated chain
