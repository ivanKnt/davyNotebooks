Rude Winter! iron sceptered power,
No more I greet thy joyless hour,
His smile no longer gilds thy form,
Nor breathes his music, in thy storm.
Rude Winter, I abhor thee now
Thou tyrant of the obdurate brow!
Wild ruins marks thy stern career
Fell spoiler of the aged year.-.
This day November's frowns invest
This day an Alien all unblest,
The parted hours I vainly mourn,
Hours, never, never, to return.-
In Thought, I yet may view the dome
Where leaves my heart its sacred home
And ah! in thought his glance arrest
Whose image fills my conscious breast,
But no - for other eyes than mine
Those orbs reflect their light divine
