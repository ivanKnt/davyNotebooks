No beam of philosophic day
Glads the poor [underline]exile[/underline] far away!
No eye explores my once-loved [unclear]place[/unclear],
No sigh my vanished form shall trace
Yet here as roams the unblessed shade
My spirit shall the scene pervade.
Oh Ocean! on whose stormy breast
A wretched wanderer's head may rest,
Hence to thy billowy surge I cast
The painful memory of the past,
Hopes barren all ! - & baneful fears !
And bodeful sighs and bitter tears
Aerial dreams of bliss untrue, - -
These be Time's fatal revenue.
Beyond the great atlantic tide
Where blue Ontario's waters glide,
The pine crown'd steeps with bloom may [insertion]glow[/insertion]
And gales of spring fragrance blow,
But never there shall summer shed
Her flowers beneath His hallowed tread
And never there, the gales shall bear
His praise ( sweet incense ) to mine ear.
