Those eyes with liquid lustre bright
In softer eyes have quench'd their light
Eyes, that withdraw their timid beams
And only dare to gaze in dreams.
[Ink flourish]

Lost scenes by thee so sweetly traced
And by thy rainbow colors graced,
Call back the hours of hope & youth
Glowing with [unclear]effacy[/unclear] & truth.--
Here let me pause o'er transports past
And hang o'er joys not meant to last
How through the primrose [unclear]studded[/unclear] walk
We [unclear]wearied[/unclear] many an hour in talk.-
As in the soft & silent eve
Of noise & [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] we took our leave
'Twas here beneath the tangled hedge
The Rose we pluck'd a simple pledge.
Not the rich Rose with thorns beset,
But spring's fair flower more humble yet
And we exchanged the dewy [unclear]prize[/unclear]
Our thoughts we changed without disguise.
