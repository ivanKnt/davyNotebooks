We lingered near the stunted Oak
That rudely thro' the pathway broke
And gazed on its fantastic head
For half its aged form was dead.
Soft play'd the vernal breezes round
And the fresh dew drops pearl'd the ground
Now as it reach'd the close of day
Unwilling we pursued our way.
To gain the little busy Boat
Where we were wont the cliffs to note
And that sequestered favourite glen
Unhaunted by the buzz of men
On the lone summit of the wood
That brooded o'er the dusky flood
Of these my harmless joys bereft
Faint is the sunshine that is left
Yet still I glow with feelings warm
The wreck of many a mental storm,
These are for thee, as fresh as true
As in my earliest days I knew.-
