15
And oft I think upon the time,
Ere I had stepp'd beyond my prime,
When thou just bounding into life
Alike unknown to grief or strife
Panted with transport for the hour
When the whole world should feel thy power.

With thee for ever could I stay,
Thy presence makes all nature glad
With thee pass each successive sad.
Oh! ev'ry moment seemed an age,
Now that I'm far my love from thee,
But thought of meeting thee assuage,
The grief which else would fatal be
[Ink flourish]
