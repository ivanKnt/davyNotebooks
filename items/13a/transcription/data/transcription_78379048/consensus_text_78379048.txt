Whene'er you speak, heaven how the listening throng
Dwell on the melting music of your tongue!
Your arguments are emblems of your mien
Mild, but not faint, & facing the serence.
But when the pow'r of eloquence you try
Here lightning strikes & there soft breezes die
Oh ' mighty love! from thy unbounded pow'r
How shall the human bosom rest secure
How shall our thought avoid the various snare
Or wisdom to our caution'd heart declare,
The different shapes thou pleasest to employ
When bent to hurt & certain to destroy.
