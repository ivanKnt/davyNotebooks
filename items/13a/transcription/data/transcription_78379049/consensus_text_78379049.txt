17
Lo! once again with jocund sway
The morn endear'd by Lovers song
When Nature holds her holiday
The wild woods wintry brakes among
But let this sprightly morn away
In youths bright calendar enroll'd
And give to me by tapers ray
The [underline]star[/underline] of [underline]Genius[/underline] to behold
Whilst in my delighted ear
Philosophy's sweet strain shall rest
In thy own image mild as fair
Shall science kindle in my breast
Thus e'en the tremulous crystal bright
That on the Rose buds leaf reclines
Where pours your [underline]Orb[/underline] its orient light
Awhile a little [underline]Orblet[/underline] shines
Awhile the beauteous pensile gem
Reflects the variegated day
But shakes the breeze its slender stem
Then melts the liquid globe away.
[Ink flourish]
