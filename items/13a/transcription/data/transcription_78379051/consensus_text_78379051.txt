Thou that dost this scroll survey
Turn not with disdain away
Nor deem these feeble lays unfold
Tale too tender to be told
Hope long since proscribed this breast
Love no more invades its rest,
For never simple virgin's heart
Fell to Love's insidious dart
But haply in some subtle guise
With wily [ gap ] or speaking sighs
As [gap] even, or fear [unclear]assayed[/unclear]
Hope the secret pass betrayed.
Dark & sad this brow of care
No myrtle wreath entwines this hair
Ne'er these lips of ashy hue
to the gentle dove shall sue
Never these wan checks disclose
Love's sweet bloom, its blushing rose
But this form of homeliest mould
Bears no sordid bosom cold
