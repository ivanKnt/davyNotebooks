Though to Beauty all unknown
Beauty's empire pleased I own
Genius with averted brow
Frowns & yet receives my vow
Nature, fortune all unkind
What but friendship soothes my mind
Take then from this faithful breast
Where thou dwell'st an honoured guest
From a Being void of aim
From a thing without a name
These honest fervent blessings take
For thine not for the givers sake
To thee may kindly fates assign
Which robed honour, peace benign
Health & all her bright haired train
Fortune & her festive reign
Love & all that Love imparts
The union of two gentle hearts
And ever as returns this day
Cherished in the jocund lay
May Joy & Virtue pair divine
Hail thee still their valentine.
