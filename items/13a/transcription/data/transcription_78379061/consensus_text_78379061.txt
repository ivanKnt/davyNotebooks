Whether pleasure is derived
from beauty or grandeur
from the alluviated vally
& the strong & beautiful
stream reflecting the verdant
images of the [unclear]beach[/unclear] &
the oak & embroidered by
green meads [deletion]of[/deletion] [unclear]gay[/unclear] with
a thousand field flowers -
or from the wild mountains
or scenes of awful [unclear]desolation[/unclear]
haunted by no sounds of
life yet still we [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
create spirit & thought
from the [unclear] only
from the [unclear] only
