[Pencil sketch underneath main text on this page perhaps showing comet tails that remain part of the atmosphere]
Rome March 20. 1819
They set the tails of Comets
be owing to the each
remaining part of the
atmosphere which is not
carried away by the sun
for it is the direction
where the joint attraction
of the nucleus & the Sun
would preserve it. [Ink sketch featuring a comet and its tail and a sun, labelled C for comet and S for sun]
