The vengeful multitudes be
{or care .
- A spirit framed in power
& pride
The changeful multitude to
[unclear]balance[/unclear] guide
Though not of busy life affraid
Yet loving best the pastoral
shade
Shedding a ray more clear
& pure
A ray which longer shall endure
As friendship's light must
ever prove
More stedfast than the light
of love.}
