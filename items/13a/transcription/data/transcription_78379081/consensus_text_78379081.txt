{Methinks I know one mind like 
you
[deletion][unclear]So[/unclear][/deletion] Alike to peace & nature
True
Kindled by [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] [deletion][unclear][insertion]happiest[/insertion][/unclear][/deletion] purest flame
In storm or calm for age the
same;
Bestowing most its brilliant
light
[unclear]Amidst[/unclear] the darkest shades of
night
And prompt to [unclear]comfort[/unclear]
[unclear]solace[/unclear] raise
cheer
The Heart oppressed by doubt}
