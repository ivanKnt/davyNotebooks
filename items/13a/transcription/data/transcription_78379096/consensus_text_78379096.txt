[deletion]No changeful[/deletion] [insertion]It sheds[/insertion] ray to kindle

No changeful lamp
The peaceful cheering [deletion]light[/deletion] [insertion]beam[/insertion]
of life.
[unclear]Shedding[/unclear] no Transitory gleams
No rays to kindle & destroy
Constant [unclear]innocuous[/unclear] state of flame
the light of life [unclear]of love[/unclear] of joy
