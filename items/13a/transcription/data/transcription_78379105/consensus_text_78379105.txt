[underline]Mont Blanc Jan[superscript]y[/superscript] 5[superscript]th[/superscript]. 1814 o'clck in the evening[/underline]
With joy I view the bath'd in purple light
Which all around is dark with joy I see
The rising from thy sea of [unclear]pitchy[/unclear] clouds
Into the middle heaven.
As if a temple to [unclear]the[/unclear] [insertion][unclear]r[/unclear][/insertion] eternal mind
Of all the earth framed of the pillar'd rock
[deletion]&[/deletion]And canopied with everlasting snow
That lovely river rolling at my feet
The bright green waves & wand'ring midst the rocks
Brown in their winters foliage gain'd from the
Its flood of waters. And through a devious [unclear]course[/unclear]
Though it has lav'd the fertile plain & washed
The cities walls & mingled with the streams
Of lowland origin - yet still preserves
Its native character of mountain strength
Its colour & its motion. Such are those
Amongst the generations of mankind
To whom the stream of thought demands from [unclear]him[/unclear]
With all the form of reason & the power
Of sacred genius - Through the world they pass
Still uncorrupted & on what they take
From social life bestow a character
Of dignity Greater they become
But never lose their native dignity
