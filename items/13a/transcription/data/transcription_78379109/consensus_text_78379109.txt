{Two thousand crescent moons
have scarce [deletion]been[/deletion]
appeared [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
Twice though dark walls resounded

the feast
The lance & target then
were bright
The plate & target then
brilliant was & gay
And [deletion]beautiful[/deletion][insertion][/insertion] the cuirass -
Chairs of state}
