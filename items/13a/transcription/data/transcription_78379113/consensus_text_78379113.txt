Pencester March [unclear]3[/unclear]
1811 -
Though thy deserted chambers
I have walked
Musing on elder times
cheering my mind
By memories of the great & noble
dead.
Within thy walls, the first high
. spirits
breathed
Who through the darkness of
the feudal times;
Threw the bright light
of letters & of Arts}
