 Thou to whom heaven its noblest gifts assigned
Blest Friend of Man, the darling of mankind,
Elect of Science on whose infant head
Truth's angel power the full orb'd Halo spread,
Awhile farewell - awhile in Freedom roam,
Far from the peopled walls, the vocal dome
To distant cliffs, on whose hoar hermit brow
The passing clouds like pilgrims lowly bow
Or, some green silent dell amid the hills,
Where rolls the music of unhaunted rills,
Some bank that scarce the travelled wild bee [insertion]knows[/insertion]
Where the lone night bird's song responsless flows.
And the sweet south, his destined course delayed
Sleeps in the fragrant bud or dewy blade
Go Thou, nor scorn this simple wreath to wear
Though thine the brighter laurel never sere
Though carved in [chemical]chemical_511|Adamant[/chemical], thy honoured name
Lives in the ark of ages, lives to Fame.
Farewell - thy form shall  fancy's eye pursue
With prayers, with vows, with wishes ever true,
And ah! if aught of good or bliss impart
 The benedictions of a faithful heart,

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11301-000-00004|dnp13a02pp|78379027[/page]
If sorcery divine or holy spell
In the firm pledge of souls devoted dwell,
When, breathed thy name in consecrated sighs 
From bosoms pure, the orisons arise,
Then, thou [underline]thrice blest[/underline] a charmed life shall bear?
To Earth, to Heaven, to Man, to Demon dear;
Then shall no fiend, no harpy dire of pain
Thy threshold blast, thy mansion's peace profane,
Nor care, the beldam care, shall haunt thy way }
Nor on thy breast, her touch unhallowed lay, }
That wan and withering palm in which all blooms decay; }
Along thy path may fruits autumnal spread,
Whilst vernal blossoms, spring beneath thy tread,
Still to thine eye, Life's green ear'd joy expand
While bends the purple vintage to thy hand.-
To thine own sphere, to nature's temple, go
Pause, at her Altar pause, with reverence low,
The one great Spirit [underline]Truth[/underline], invoke, adore.
And hymns of praise, of holy rapture pour,
For [underline]Thee[/underline], the secret portal open flies, }
Free to thy feet the sanctuary lies, }
And the veils' wavy folds, the mystic folds arise }

Be
Beloved of Heaven! for Thee, be formed the bower
Of leaves impervious to the solar power,
Where scarce the arrowy beam may glide between
The rude arcade of deepest, densest green,
Where as in Eden's blissful shade of rest
When Man held converse with an angel guest,
Mayst Thou embosomed in thy still retreat,
The blue eyed cherub contemplation greet.
There muse intent on Nature's spotless page
To some a blank, but to the inspired sage,
The book of Life, where Love & Wisdom shine
The almighty thought "creation's type" divine.
Go with truth's wand, the giant shades arrest
That linger on the mountain's sinewy breast,
And mid sepulchral rocks that proudly stand,
The Pyramids unwrought of mortal hand,
Mid ruins sanctified by elder time
When rose the spirit of the floods sublime
Draw from the dusky ore, the silent stone
The ancient records of a world unknown,
Dash from the seaborn base, oblivion's wave
Redeem the chart of ages, from the grave.

Or wilt thou by a purer spirit led
Philanthropy - the grassy woodlands tread,
What time the Lark, harmonious herald! hails
His minstrel brethren of the woods & dales.
When hasting from the dewy tents away
From hill to hill swift flies the golden day,
At living Nature's "rich mysterious shrine"
Detect the unwrought vegetable mine,
With chemic care, the shining furrows trace
And scatter blessings on the human race.-
Yet here - though sweet the scene - forbear to stay
A different region claims thy potent sway
A new creation, by thy forming [deletion][unclear]skill[/unclear][/deletion] will
From chaos called, to thee obedient still,
Where dwells thy voice on beauty's raptured ear
Experience listens, Folly drops her sneer
Ah! not to sadness, to regret resign
This infant Orb of science, only thine.
For absent Thou - what friendly spirit calls
To this dark roof - these desolated walls,

Oh! were I rich in nature's lore
For [underline]Him[/underline] I would her worlds explore
For Him with pious avarice sweep
The treasures of the mineral deep
And steal the starry gems that throw
Pale lustre o'er the realms below
Sweet were each care & soft each toil
If once rewarded with his smile.
And cheaply all could I resign
If but [underline]his[/underline] hand [underline]received[/underline] from mine
But me alas! the fates unkind
Within a narrow sphere confined,
Nor fortune hailed my natal hour
Nor wisdom gave her sacred dower.
Go - simple gift, thou humble band
Go, thou, unformed by venal hand
Thy destin'd Lord's acceptance sue
And with thee take this last adieu;

And if a gentle heart he bear
A Heart to gentle spirits dear,
Then shall he to a stranger's prayer
Consent a stranger's pledge to wear,
And, ah, these conscious eyes again
Shall heal the tributary chain
Oh Thou! whose influence oft hath blest
This little world within my breast,
Whose image gilds the pensive hour
Of fancy's vision-weaving power,
Though, nought this gift so simple, boast
And but some sighs the giver cost
Yet oh with smile benignant deign
These links to touch, to wear this chain
And if ( as Fame the unwilling ear
Informs ) a softer chain Thou bear,
Then may no darkling shade destroy
The fabric of thy promised joy,
And may all spirits blest & good
Unseen who haunt or wave or wood
Aethereal nature's sportive train
On Thee "sweet influences rain"

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11301-000-00010|dnp13a08pp|78379036[/page]
And breathe a sense no words impart
Well augured of the thrilling heart
But if with rigid scowl severe
My lowly suit thou shame to hear,
My simple gift if Thou disdain
All reckless of another's pain,
Not long thy stream of bliss shall flow
Nor long thy touch of rapture glow,
Who from the lips of asking child
Withholds the fragrant blossom wild,
Who from the wretched captives' power
Uproots the solitary flower,
Whose contumely blasts the sighs
That from the guileless bosom rise,
Oh not for him Love's hallowed Urn
The golden light of life shall burn
Oh not for him the aethereal flame
That quivers through the feeling frame;
Inert, dull, earthly in the mould
That bears an iron bosom cold.-

Oh yield then to a guiltless prayer,
The simple chain consent to wear
That chain accepted let me view
Then look a long & sad adieu.
And oft the dewy skies beneath
When all of peace of love shall breathe,
Oft in some cloud that sails serene
Alone in heaven's blue ocean seen,
When slow the paly shadows glide
The violets' perfumed bank beside
And their sweet buds the flowrets close
And wakes the heart, while all repose
Oft e'en from air, thy form, thy face
Thy shape, thy last, last look retrace
And with a grateful tear again
Review the consecrated chain

Rude Winter! iron sceptred power,
No more I greet thy joyless hour,
[underline]His[/underline] smile no longer gilds thy form,
Nor breathes his music, in thy storm;
Rude Winter, I abhor thee now
Thou tyrant of the obdurate brow!
Wild ruin marks thy stern career
Fell spoiler of the aged year.-.
This day November's frowns invest
This day an Alien all unblest,
The parted hours I vainly mourn,
[underline]Hours[/underline], never, never, to return.-
In Thought, I yet may view the dome
Where leaves my heart its sacred home
And ah! in thought, his glance arrest
Whose image fills my conscious breast,
But no - for other eyes than mine
Those orbs reflect their light divine

No beam of philosophic day
Glads the poor [underline]exile[/underline] far away!
No eye explores my once-loved place,
No sigh my vanished form shall trace
Yet here as roams the unblessed shade
My spirit shall the scene pervade.
Oh Ocean! on whose stormy breast
A wretched wanderer's head may rest,
Hence to thy billowy surge I cast
The painful memory of the past,
Hopes barren all ! - & baneful fears !
And bodeful sighs & bitter tears
Aerial dreams of bliss untrue, - -
These be Time's fatal revenue.

Her flowers beneath His hallowed tread
And never there, the gales shall bear

Now farewell fortune - farewell fear,
And hope - sweet syren, ever dear -
Now all, / save bankrupt life / resigned

How oft the little sportive child
Seizing every flowret wild
With feeble hand half crops the stem
And leaves to die the drooping gem!
Unconscious of the slightest harm
His joyous breast with rapture warm
From bank to bank unthinking flies
Nor knows the weeping flowret dies.-
So have thy heedless glances stray'd
And many a virgin heart betray'd,
From fair to fair their lightnings dart
And strike the gazer to the heart.-

Lost scenes by thee so sweetly traced
And by thy rainbow colors graced,
Call back the hours of hope & youth
Glowing with ecstacy & truth.--
Here let me pause o'er transports past
And hang o'er joys not meant to last
How through the primrose studded walk
We wearied many an hour in talk.-
As in the soft & silent eve
Of noise & mirth we took our leave
'Twas here beneath the tangled hedge
The Rose we pluck'd a simple pledge.
Not the rich Rose with thorns beset,
But spring's fair flower more humble yet,
And we exchanged the dewy prize
Our thoughts we changed without disguise.

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11301-000-00016|dnp13a14pp|78379045[/page]
We lingered near the stunted Oak
That rudely thro' the pathway broke
And gazed on its fantastic head
For half its aged form was dead.
Soft play'd the vernal breezes sound
And the fresh dew drops pearl'd the ground
Now as it reach'd the close of day
Unwilling we pursued our way.
To gain the little busy Boat
Where we were wont the cliffs to note
And that sequestered favourite glen
Unhaunted by the buzz of men
Or the lone summit of the wood
That brooded o'er the dusky flood
Of these my harmless joys bereft
Faint is the sunshine that is left
Yet still I glow with feelings warm
The wreck of many a mental storm,
These, are for thee, as fresh as true
As in my earliest days I knew.-

And oft I think upon the time,
Ere I had stepp'd beyond my prime,
When thou just bounding into life
Alike unknown to grief or strife
Panted with transport for the hour
When the whole world should feel thy power.
Ibid
[Ink flourish]
With thee for ever could I stay,
Thy presence makes all nature glad
With thee pass each successive day.
Nor ever feel one moment sad.
Oh! ev'ry moment seems an age,
Now that I'm far my love from thee,
But thoughts of meeting thee assuage,
The grief which else would fatal be

Whene'er you speak, heav'n how the listening throng
Dwell on the melting music of your tongue!
Your arguments are emblems of your mien
Mild, but not faint, & forcing tho' serene.
But when the pow'r of eloquence you try
Here lightning strikes & there soft breezes die
Oh ' mighty love! from thy unbounded pow'r
How shall the human bosom rest secure
How shall our thought avoid the various snare
Or wisdom to our caution'd heart declare,
The different shapes thou pleasest to employ
When bent to hurt & certain to destroy.

Lo! once again with jocund sway
The morn endear'd by Lovers song
When Nature holds her holiday
The wild woods wintry brakes among
But let this sprightly morn away
In youths' bright calendar enroll'd
And give to me by tapers ray
The [underline]star[/underline] of [underline]Genius[/underline] to behold
Whilst in my delighted ear
Philosophy's sweet strain shall rest
In thy own image mild as fair
Shall science kindle in my breast
Thus e'en the tremulous crystal bright
That on the Rose buds leaf reclines
When pours yon [underline]Orb[/underline] its orient light
Awhile a little [underline]Orblet[/underline] shines
Awhile the beauteous pensile gem
Reflects the variegated Ray
But shakes the breeze its slender stem
Then melts the liquid globe away.

Thou that dost this scroll survey
Turn not with disdain away
Nor deem these feeble lays unfold
Tale too tender to be told
Hope long since proscribed this breast
Love no more invades its rest,
For never simple virgin's heart
Fell to Love's insidious dart
But haply in some subtle guise
With wily [ gap ] or speaking sighs
As [gap] even, or fear [unclear]assayed[/unclear]
Hope the secret pass betrayed.
Dark & sad this brow of care
No myrtle wreath entwines this hair
Ne'er these lips of ashy hue
To the gentle dove shall sue
Never these wan cheeks disclose
Love's sweet bloom, its blushing rose
But this form of homeliest mould
Bears no sordid bosom cold

Though to Beauty all unknown
Beauty's empire pleased I own
Genius with averted brow
Frowns & yet receives my vow
Nature, fortune all unkind
What but friendship soothes my mind
Take then from this faithful breast
Where thou dwell'st an honoured guest
From a Being void of aim
From a thing without a name
These honest fervent blessings take
For thine not for the givers sake
To thee may kindly fates assign
White robed honour, peace benign
Health & all her bright haired train
Fortune & her festive reign
Love & all that Love imparts
The union of two gentle hearts
And ever as returns this day
Cherished in the jocund lay
May Joy & Virtue pair divine
Hail thee still their valentine.

That lovely river rolling at my feet
Its bright green waves & wand'ring midst the rocks
Brown in their winters foliage gain'd from the
Its flood of waters. And through a devious course
Though it has lav'd the fertile plain & washed
The cities walls & mingled with the streams
Of lowland origin - yet still preserves
Its native character of mountain strength
Its colour & its motion. Such are those
Amongst the generations of mankind
To whom the stream of thought descends from heaven
With all the force of reason & the power
Of sacred genius - Through the world they pass
Still uncorrupted & on what they take
From social life bestow a character
Of dignity Greater they become
But never lose their native dignity
