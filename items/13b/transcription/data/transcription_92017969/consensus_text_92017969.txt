Marburg May 24 1827
My object is not so much
to give an account of
myself, for this would be
neither interesting nor instructive
but rather to recall those
passages of my life which
are of an extraordinary
return from their relations
to a very extraordinary
Person. His opinions [deletion]are[/deletion]
were to me so singular
his lessons so instructive
& his history so mysterious
that they are worthy of
being recorded.
