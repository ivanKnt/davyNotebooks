[underline]The Mod. Socrates[/underline].
- I have taken a presumptuous title
for a very humble narration. Yet
one that contains very
extraordinary circumstances - I
think it right to give to
the world the history of my
relations with a most [deletion]extraordinary[/deletion]
singular being; whose character
& even notion I am still
unable to [deletion]dev[/deletion] develope.-. Those
who Know me will not
[deletion]long be[/deletion] suspect [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] me of having
written romances; [deletion]those who[/deletion]
[deletion]know me will not believe this[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]possible[/underline][/deletion]; & those who do
not know me may perhaps
find in my writing the proof
