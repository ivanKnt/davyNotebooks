Asked me I had lately heard
From Madame M. -
At the sound of a name
so [deletion]dear[/deletion] [insertion]interesting[/insertion] to me I started. I felt
I [deletion]had seen[/deletion] [insertion]that I must have[/insertion] seen the person
before. - I supposed He
was some italian in
the suite of the Austrian
Minister. His physionomy
was agreeable He appeared
about 45. His eye was
black & piercing. His face
had the hue of steady
& sedentary pursuit, His
smile was sweet & his
look sedate; His forehead
had all the smoothness [insertion]& expansion[/insertion] of
intellect without the stain
