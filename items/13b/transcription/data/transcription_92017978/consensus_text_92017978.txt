In the common intercourse of
life, we do not mark
the changes produced by time
in the Persons we are in
the habit of seeing daily,

succeeds to gray hair &
wrinkle to wrinkle & the
last impression alone remains
But even a short absence
sometimes enables us to
discover the progress of old
age: What most surprized
