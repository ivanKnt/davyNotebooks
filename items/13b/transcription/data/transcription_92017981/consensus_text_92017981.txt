beauty, & the Sabine
Hills frowning in grandeur
amidst the wrecks of the
monuments of the past
glory of a great people
Nature appeared undecayed
& unsullied, the same
in her form & resources
as 8000 years ago saw
Save when the wrecks
of art [deletion]or the engines[deletion]
[deletion]of Man[/deletion] had made
her face [insertion]face[/insertion] generally
or the remains 
of a worn out
agriculture had shaped
