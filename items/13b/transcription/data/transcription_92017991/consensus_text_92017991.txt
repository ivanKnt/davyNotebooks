thinking of the Person in
whom You take most
interest; yet you will regret
that You have not acceeded
to my proposition, & I wish
You may not assert it
The passions like the mirage
or that state of the atmosphere
produced by intense heat which
is the cause of the Fata
Morgugna hide near objects
& [deletion]exalt distant ones[/deletion] magnify
& exalt distant ones so that
the traveller entirely [insertion]cannot ascertain[/insertion] [deletion]loses[/deletion] [deletion]the[/deletion] their
[deletion]way[/deletion] [insertion]relation[/insertion] You are sacrificing,
your health, your fortune
& which is still more important
Your time to a sentiment
