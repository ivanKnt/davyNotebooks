She is every thing generous
noble & exalted, She was
married at 14 from a
convent & without her consent
She has never loved & never
deceived her Husband. She
has been called capricious
because coxcombs on
whom she smiled or
to whom she was civil
imagined they were in
possession of her heart &
who [insertion]have[/insertion] revenged themselves for
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] wounds [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] inflicted
on their vanity by attacking
her reputation. I am
ashamed of my countrymen
when I think of the
calumnies that have been
heralded with regard to this
superior woman, I am astounded
