not even paid my usual
morning visit to M
in the evening I proposed
to her a walk on
the piazza, but She
said this is a night
for moonlight scenery,
let us go in a Gondola
towards the Western Shore
& should us not return
till midnight, there is
no fear of Coldness [unclear]xx[/unclear]
of storm in such
a heavenly night
