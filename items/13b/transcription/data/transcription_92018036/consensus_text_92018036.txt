I led this life of a
sybarite for more than
two months, loving
& believing myself beloved -
Without intellectual pursuits
my mind became enfeebled
& without bodily exercise
my health became impaired
I was in a constant
fever & my faithful
Jos became alarmed
for my health. [unclear]She[/unclear]
however affected to perceive
no change & often
