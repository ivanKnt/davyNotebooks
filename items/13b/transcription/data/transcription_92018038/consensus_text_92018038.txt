- The punishment of those
souls who have avoided the
sympathies of human nature &
sacrificed every thing to Selfishness
is of a kind which the 
imagination - "They had eyes
& they saw not" &c but in their
state of punishment they have
all the desires of their mortal
life without any of the powers of
gratifying them; & they are constantly
tortured by a vain & burning
desire.- They see objects which
they wish to grasp but they
have no hands. Objects of beauty
floating before them in the
air but they have no wings
