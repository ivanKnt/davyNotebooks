I once [insertion]was acquainted[/insertion] [deletion]knew[/deletion] said the Unknown with
a very extraordinary Being; whose
nature appeared to be super
human & I met him under
circumstances so extraordinary that
the whole train of events
connected with him, appears to
be at this interval of time
more like a dream than a reality
[unclear]to reach there[/unclear]. They [unclear]have[/unclear] an
ardent desire to converse
but they have no tongues
they see lesser heresy &
are sin they utter articulate
sounds but they have no
[unclear]ears[/unclear]: The volume of Nature
is open before them but so distant
