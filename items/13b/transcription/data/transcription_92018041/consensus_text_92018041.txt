It is many, many years since
I was exploring the shore of
Palestine & watching one
calm evening the waves
breaking upon that desert
strand where Tyre the first
Queen of [deletion]Nature[/deletion] [insertion]the Ocean[/insertion] once stood
- My feelings were of the
most melancholy kind This
City which three hundred years
ago was the [unclear]heart[/unclear] of the
[unclear]civilized[/unclear] globe; was gone without
a vestige remaining, save that
the pebbles on the shore were
mingled with a few rounded
bits of glass & porcelain;
& a red sand with gritty masses
