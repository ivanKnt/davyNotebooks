To attempt to describe my
feelings even at this interval
of time is very painful.-
I no longer wished to live
The world was no longer of
any value to me. I was no
longer beloved. I was cast
aside for a new Boy, a
artist character of talents
& this by the woman whose
talents I respected more than
I even admired her beauty &
whom I had held off as
a model of purity & taste
as the perfection of refinement
in body & mind I do not
think [deletion]this[/deletion] wounded vanity
