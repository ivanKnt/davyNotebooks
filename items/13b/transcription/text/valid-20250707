Kaλo.- It is granted.- I

able to divine at once the

Marburg May 24 1827
My object is not so much
to give an account of
myself, for this would be
neither interesting nor instructive
but rather to recall those
passages of my life which
are of an extraordinary
return from their relations
to a very extraordinary
Person. His opinions [deletion]are[/deletion]
were to me so singular
his lessons so instructive
& his history so mysterious
that they are worthy of
being recorded.

[underline]The Mod. Socrates[/underline].

- I have taken a presumptuous title
  for a very humble narration. Yet
  one that contains very
  extraordinary circumstances - I
  think it right to give to
  the world the history of my
  relations with a most [deletion]extraordinary[/deletion]
  singular being; whose character
  & even notion I am still
  unable to [deletion]dev[/deletion] develope.-. Those
  who Know me will not
  [deletion]long be[/deletion] suspect [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] me of having
  written romances; [deletion]those who[/deletion]
  [deletion]know me will not believe this[/deletion]
  [deletion][underline]possible[/underline][/deletion]; & those who do
  not know me may perhaps
  find in my writing the proof

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00016|dnp13b014pp|92017971[/page]
of a diseased imagination;
Be this as it may.-
I trust that the opinions
found in these Pages & which
belong[deletion]ing[/deletion] to a mind far
superior to my own may
be as useful to others as
they have been to me. My
reason for the title of
the modern Socrates is
that the great Philosopher
of Antiquity is said to
have engaged the visitations
of a good genius. There
[deletion]is[/deletion] are [deletion]another[/deletion] two other points of analogy,
& probably the only ones
besides between us. - I

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00017|dnp13b015pp|92017972[/page]
15
may express my likeness to
the engraved gems of Socrates
without being accused of variety:
& my [unclear]Xantppe[/unclear] would have
been immortalized had She
been immortalized had She
been the Wife of as great
a Man.

- It was in one of the
  great crowds that assemble in
  the beginning of June at
  the M. of L. that a
  Person approached me &
  bowed; & with a good manner
  & very soft tone that had
  something of a foreign accent

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00018|dnp13b016pp|92017973[/page]
Asked me I had lately heard
From Madame M. -
At the sound of a name
so [deletion]dear[/deletion] [insertion]interesting[/insertion] to me I started. I felt
I [deletion]had seen[/deletion] [insertion]that I must have[/insertion] seen the person
before. - I supposed He
was some italian in
the suite of the Austrian
Minister. His physionomy
was agreeable He appeared
about 45. His eye was
black & piercing. His face
had the hue of steady
& sedentary pursuit, His
smile was sweet & his
look sedate; His forehead
had all the smoothness [insertion]& expansion[/insertion] of
intellect without the stain

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00019|dnp13b017pp|92017974[/page]
17
of passion or the wrinkles
of care. He conversed
with me for a considerable
time very agreebly but
upon very common topics
principaly upon subjects
which I had particularly
studied, such as the
eruptions of Vesuvius, the
MSS of Herculaneum
the discoveries of Maio
And He seemed to [deletion]be[/deletion] know
well [deletion]acquainted with[/deletion]
allmost all my foreign
acquaintances-. We separated
in the crowd & I lost sight
of him & though I was

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00020|dnp13b018pp|92017975[/page]
very anxious to know who
He was & made
enquiries respecting such
a person I could hear
nothing of him,- I must
have met him before - from
the familiarity of his address.
I have often had a
renewal of slight acquaintance
| in this way:- I
endeavoured during two
or three hours [deletion]of[/deletion] which
ought to have been
devoted to sleep to
recollect when I had seen

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00021|dnp13b019pp|92017976[/page]
19
him before for I was
convinced his face was
familiar to me. Was
it. At M. at Vienna
or at Sir C. S.
at Naples. - No
every thing belonging
to him if I had ever
seen him before had
vanished. & I reproached
myself with having forgoten
so very interesting a person.

- I did not see him
  again in London that
  season.- but in going into

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00022|dnp13b020pp|92017977[/page]
the steam packet to
cross at Dover. His
face flashed upon me
lighted up by the fire
of the Boiler; in a cold
winters night in Dec[superscript]r[/superscript].-
He [deletion]stood[/deletion] was nearer to it than
I felt disposed to stand
yet the desire of renewing
my acquaintance with him
brought me up to the
bottom of the grate. &
we exchanged salutations
He spoke as to an
old acquaintance

In the common intercourse of
life, we do not mark
the changes produced by time
in the Persons we are in
the habit of seeing daily,
they are too gradual to
be perceived, gray hair
succeeds to gray hair &
wrinkle to wrinkle & the
last impression alone remains
But even a short absence
sometimes enables us to
discover the progress of old
age: What most surprized

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00024|dnp13b022pp|92017979[/page]
me in my friend, was
that after this long absence
of two years, there was
not the smallest change
[deletion][unclear]approaching to[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]rather approaching to[/insertion] the meridian
of life when I first saw
him ten years ago. His
countenance had the same
freshness, His eye was
as bright & his step
as vigorous as ever
Had He discovered
the long sought elexir
of the Alchemists, or

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00025|dnp13b023pp|92017980[/page]

was He a being of a
superior order, like that
plastic spirit which He
once imaged to me.-
It was on one of those
beautiful nights towards the
close of spring, one of the

as at Rome - I had
been walking beyond the
Church of S[superscript]t[/superscript] John Lateran

of the Campagna where the

I first Saw Madame M. at
Lady Ds; She must have been
then past thirty, yet eminently
beautiful, she was rather below
than above the middle size, [deletion]beautifully[/deletion]
[insertion]well[/insertion] formed with the exception perhaps
of her feet & hands which were
rather too large, Her countenance
was full of expression. Her mouth
[deletion]sweet[/deletion] beautiful her teeth white
& even her hair of a jetty
blackness, Her voice harmonious
& sweeter sounds never issued
from a bocca romana
Her large dark eyes had
more of brilliancy &

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00030|dnp13b028pp|92017985[/page]
spirit than softness; but
their lustre was tempered
by the long [insertion]dark[/insertion] eye lashes under
which, they stare. Her
countenance would have
been [insertion]beautifully[/insertion] severe [deletion][unclear]xx withou[/unclear][/deletion]
but for the sweetness of
her smile which invited
your confidence, though
it interfered with your
repose, She was
highly accomplished, sang
played well on the harps
& was possessed of several
languages

She was the friend of the
celebrated Mezzoforte who
is perhaps the most remarkable
Scholar existing in Europe.-
She was amorous as the
Italian women [insertion]usually[/insertion] are not
merely from passion but from
the love of glory, She delighted
in [deletion]naming[/deletion] her conquests when
they were over distinguished
Persons; but she followed
entirely the impulses of her
heart, & was

Hitherto there was nothing that
could not be explained in the
intercourse between the Unknown
& myself; but the circumstance
which I am about to relate
is of another character & I
have never been able to account
for it except by supposing some
peculiar & supernatural powers
in this mysterious Being.
We had parted at Salzburg He
told me He was going to the
North of Europe & strongly pressed
me to accompany him, He described
the capital [deletion]of[/deletion] erected by the Genius

[deletion]glowing colours[/deletion]. amidst the marshes
of the Neva with so much
precision & force that I was

in so masterly a manner,

usually belong only to [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] Man
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] & yet the

- The unknown had not
  left me an hour when
  I was on my road to
  Italy, I travelled rapidly;
  & stopped only for refreshment.
  I was but little attentive

  [unclear]sometimes[/unclear] after [deletion][unclear]about[/unclear][/deletion] the

had been a little subdued
by the out breaking of of
associating & confusion
of ideas which belong to
sleep & dreams, I felt
myself drawn as I had
been before to the magnificence
& beauty of nature.-
It was on one of those
occasions that descending
the mountains towards
Wurzen on the [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
road, that I caught
the first view of the Krain
or Carniola
Save, a beautiful

of the morning was reflected
from the snows on the
highest peak of these
wild & craggy mountains;
the [deletion]plain[/deletion] [insertion]valley[/insertion] & the lake below
were still in twilight;
As the sun rose the
whole scene was lighted
up by a brillant glow
from [deletion]rosy[/deletion] [insertion]red[/insertion] clouds in
the east; & the green
& wooded hills above the
Save & the meadows
broken by hedge rows

[insertion]the bright atmosphere of the [unclear]land[/unclear][/insertion]I regarded the beauty
of the day as an

though the clouds soon

followed by a tremendous

yet such was the

that my presentimentions
were all on the favorable
side. -
I have often reasoned with
myself on my own tendency
to superstition, I have never
been able entirely to divest
myself of the idea that

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00050|dnp13b048pp|92018006[/page]
certain circumstances occur
in trains when there is
not the slightest apparent

from the idea that
a moral effect must
be produced upon the
minds of his soldiers
as from some vague
superstitious notion.
I have sometimes thought
that the most powerful
minds most distrust
human reason,
Science & the progress
of enquiry shews such
extraordinary relations

that there is no drawing

experience, We know something
of the physical laws of
nature; but nothing
of the moral; & the
whole oeconomy of thought
& animation may be
connected in such a
manner that the slightest
& most triffling event
may be the cause of
the destinies of individuals
& Nations. - I shall
at a future time
relate a conversation
which I had on this
very subject with the

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00054|dnp13b052pp|92018010[/page]
unknown.- but to
go on with my narration.
I arrived at Venice the
third morning after my
departure from Salzburg. &
in less than an hour
after my arrival was
at M. feet. She embraced
me in a manner which
convinced me of the strength
& constancy of her attachment
& my happiness was compleat
Her husband was not
with her. She had no
companion except her
neice a girl of 12

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00055|dnp13b053pp|92018011[/page]
53
years of age; for the first
two days after my arrival
She received no company
& we were the world
to each other. The
habits of her country induced
her however to receive
Company & I induced
her to resume her
conversazione when [deletion][unclear]She[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Natives & strangers
mingled together; to me
this society with two
or three exceptions was
extremely insipid. The
women of Italy have more

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00056|dnp13b054pp|92018012[/page]
of character than the
men probably because
the female character is
mere imitation & many
of them approach to
the natives of other
countries whereas the
men have all the
hereditary fullness of
a worn out People.
[deletion]I saw a[/deletion] The Italians
however of upper Italy
are so much superior
to those of Naples

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00057|dnp13b055pp|92018013[/page]
55
& Rome that they may
be regarded, as a different
race; yet of distinguished
Men even in upper Italy
I have found few who
may not be considered
rather as belonging to
the Alps than to
plains & belonging in
fact to what the
ancient Romans considered
as Gaul. Volta,
Canova. Piazzi
Scarpa, Monti
these names which

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00058|dnp13b056pp|92018014[/page]
are glorious now &
would have been glorious
in the best ages of
the world are all
mountaineers.

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00059|dnp13b057pp|92018015[/page]
57
But why should I relate such
conversations which can be
interesting only to myself. -
The human mind in a
state of excitement exalts
its ideas by its passions,
& the most triffling thoughts
the most absurd speeches
have under such circumstances
been considered as proofs of
talent or wit - The
false light of love like
the glare of a stormy
sunset gives its own
brilliant colours to
every object on which

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11302-000-00060|dnp13b058pp|92018016[/page]
it falls & [insertion]lights up[/insertion] even the stagnant
pool or the muddy lake
[deletion]both beautiful & pure[/deletion]
with hints of beauty -
The scene & one conversation
however between M &
myself I must describe
as it was the last in
which I enjoyed calm
& unalloyed happiness.
It was a calm & beautiful
night in the end of June
The day had been
oppressively hot & I had

59
not even paid my usual
morning visit to M
in the evening I proposed
to her a walk on
the piazza, but She
said this is a night
for moonlight scenery,
let us go in a Gondola
towards the Western Shore
& should us not return
till midnight, there is
no fear of Coldness [unclear]xx[/unclear]
of storm in such
a heavenly night

caring little for public opinion
What D said is the
reason that selfish proud

foreigners in their train
or as their servant
because their own
Countrymen will not

catch all the intimates
of peevishness - bad temper

just as the last purple

was reflected in

covered with snow
& the pine wood & the

The nightingales were

there was no other

of the wave struck

is this scene she said
Nature seems as it

yet how active are
our minds & hearts
such moments as these
convince me of the

the object of its adoration
Her eyes sparkled as
she spoke & as she
pressed her burning lips
to mine, it seemed to me
as a pledge & a sign
of immortality -
May our love I said
be immortal -
We were roused from
our trance of delight
by [deletion]the[/deletion] an exclamation

at the same time a
bright meteor shot
through the sky; exploded
into brilliant stars
& disappeared leaving
behind it a bright

It might have excited

Without intellectual pursuits

- The punishment of those

  City which three hundred years

My time is come - I
was standing at some
distance from him -
For his voice was so
loud & musical that
I might have heard
it much further. As
He spoke the last

from the rock &
disappeared.- I saw
no struggling. & nothing
but a glow of light

asked them if they
had not heard me

To attempt to describe my
feelings even at this interval
of time is very painful.-
I no longer wished to live
The world was no longer of
any value to me. I was no
longer beloved. I was cast
aside for a new Boy, a

talents I respected more than
I even admired her beauty &
whom I had held off as
a model of purity & taste
as the perfection of refinement
