An unshaped mass of living sentiment
My feelings were the feelings that the voice
of nature gives to man. –

And in my peaceful bosom was
the love of nature mingled
with the love of man. –

And with no sophistry no damned

lies
convert unto the purpose of his
soul – The eternal thoughts of
nature.

[Horizontal rule]
To me no shaping intellect had given
The everlasting laws which her sons
The many days of pleasure yours
As often in the shapings of his mind
The renovated thoughts of former days
Awoke the pleasant feelings, and He saw
Bright & obscure as in the feverish dreams
of future greatness all the mighty past
The dweller in the stately palaces
The son of regal pomp. And then He turned
To his poor kindred. Smitten by the hand
[deletion]The iron hand[/deletion] of [insertion]ancient[/insertion] power the labourers of the nile
