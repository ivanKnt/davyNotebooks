Shall I renounce the countenance
living in [insertion]the[/insertion] beauty of expression
shall I give up the articulately
sounding voice whose gentle sound
has so often lullâ€™d me to
repose to worship the dry
& unmeaning word benevolence
no let me live a son a
brother & a lover, let
me die a [deletion]father[/deletion] a
husband a friend &

a father.

[underline]On breathing the Nitrous Oxide[/underline]
Not in the ideal dreams of wild

desire
Have I beheld a rapture wakening
form
My bosom burns with no unhallowed
fire
Yet is my cheek with rosy
blushes warm.
Yet are my eyes with sparkling
lustre filled
Yet is my [deletion]murmuring[/deletion] mouth

implete with [insertion][deletion]murmuring[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]dying[/deletion] [insertion]murmuring[/insertion] sound
