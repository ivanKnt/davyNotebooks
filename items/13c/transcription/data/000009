nature gives. –
The liquid dew becomes the 

rosy flower

The sordid dust awakes &

moves & lives. –

All, All is change, the renovated forms
Of ancient things arise & live again.
The light of suns the angry breath of storms
The everlasting motions of the main
Are but the engines of that powerful
will. –
The eternal link of thoughts, where firm
resolves
Have ever acted & are acting still. –
Whilst age round age & world round
world revolves. –
