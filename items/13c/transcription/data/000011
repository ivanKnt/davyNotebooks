To view the heavens with [deletion]solar[/deletion] [insertion]morning[/insertion]
radiance [deletion]white[/deletion] bright
Majestic mingling with [insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]still[/deletion]
[deletion]blue sea[/deletion] ocean blue. –

[deletion]filled by [/deletion][deletion]the a[/deletion][deletion] thousand silver[/deletion]
streams
[deletion]& played upon by ten thousand[/deletion]
[deletion]cloudless breezes[/deletion]
To view the [deletion]meadows[/deletion] [insertion]forests[/insertion] green
the mountains white
The peopled plains of rich
& varyied hue. –
To feel the social flame to give
Ten thousand signs of [deletion]kindling[/deletion] [insertion]burning[/insertion] energy,
The nothingness of human words to scan.
The nothingness of human [deletion]scenes[/deletion] [insertion]things[/insertion] to
fly. –

To live in forests mingled with

[deletion]the whole[/deletion]
Of natures forms to [deletion]die[/deletion] [deletion]beneat[/deletion]

[deletion]upon[/deletion] feel the breezes play
Oer the parched [deletion]forehead[/deletion] [insertion]brow[/insertion]. to see
the planets roll.
