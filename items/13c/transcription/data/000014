Though on the blue & lowly flower.
Nursed by the dews of spring
Upon the wild & life deserted heath
The blasts of ocean blow, the electric fires
lights terrible
Yet does it [insertion]sometimes[/insertion] feel the [deletion]pleasant[/deletion] ray
Of clouded morning suns

And the [deletion]glad[/deletion] [insertion]soft[/insertion] palms of morning mountain
Wafted by breezes warmthful as the light
Of summer [deletion][unclear][deletion]xxxx[/deletion]//unclear][/deletion] days. –

Though on the peaches orbed form
And sweet empurpled juice
The vegetable despot armed in mail
Hard & of many colors, feeds unawed
Insatiate

Yet through the wound made by
his tooth
