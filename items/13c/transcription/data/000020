The poet had prepared & in the coach
Fit for the journey laid two pondrous
books
Ycleped folios These contained indeed
His darling poem that great
history
Of Alfred best of Kings from out
whose loins
Came George the third He who is
married to
Our good Queen Charlotte. This being
done
He spake unto his fellow
Traveller & said. –
Thou knowst the way. His
fellow man replied
I know the way. Then on the
Poets face
played a soft smile: soft
as when leaves of trees
look in a brook. & to
the whistling wind that oer
them sweeps
Makes mildest melody. –
