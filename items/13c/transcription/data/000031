Marrish in health had born his misfortunes
with fortitude; but pain had unnerved
his mind & his last hopes sunk
beneath the accumulated weight of
disease & misery. –
His cough increased the pain in
his chest became more acute, He
was either chilled or burnt by
the paroxysms of an acute disease.
The successions of hopes & fears which
occupy common minds in the last stage
of consumption had no place in his.
His character [insertion]was[/insertion] blasted his life [insertion]was[/insertion] forfeited
to the laws there was no hope
on earth. The world presented no
resting place on which his wearied
spirit might repose. – The ideas of
his wife & child sometimes for
a few moments occupied his
mind & the golden dreams of
former days awoke more acute
misery more intense recollections
of the present moment. –
