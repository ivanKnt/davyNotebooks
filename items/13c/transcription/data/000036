Making Man one with Nature

[Horizontal rule]
To him has Genesis given the [insertion]awful[/insertion] power
of [deletion]Harmony[/deletion] [insertion]sacred[/insertion]. To whom the woods & streams
And the white mountains & the azure

sky
Are full of life & harmony. To him
Whose eye is wet with tears of joy
When nature beams with joy & happiness
Whose smiles responsive the smiles of man
Are every where the harbingers of Love
And consolation. –

[Horizontal rule]
The autumn seemed to
mingle with the spring so mild
is the weather. –
