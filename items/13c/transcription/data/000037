Peter Murray from June to Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]
went [deletion][unclear][deletion]xxx[/deletion][/unclear][/deletion] upon the [unclear]rein[/unclear] He was
sometimes absent from his house
for [deletion][unclear][deletion]xxx[/deletion][/unclear][/deletion] two or three days together.
During his absence Mary often

had those anxieties so common
to children s[deletion]he had heard enough[/deletion]
[deletion]the[/deletion] & which are generally produced
by the recollection of pains
experienced during the [deletion]abse[/deletion]nce
of [deletion][unclear][deletion]xxx[/deletion][/deletion][/unclear] friends. The uneasiness
of her mother & often her
peevishness at those times
increased her disagreable
feelings. She often ascended the
the hill to look out for her
fathers boat. sometimes her
straining eyes aided by her vivid
imagination would recognise [deletion]his[/deletion]
it in the grey clouds. What
joy did she feel in the
morning when she saw it
entering the cave & what
greater joy when she saw it
laden with fish
