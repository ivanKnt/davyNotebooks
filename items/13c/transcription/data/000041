[deletion]Many days of sunshine & of clouds h[/deletion]ave
[deletion]passed away since I last saw[/deletion]
[deletion]you at [/deletion][deletion]Marazion[/deletion][deletion] on my[/deletion]
[deletion]road to London[/deletion].
A long time is elapsed since I last
saw you on my road to London
I have not written to you &
I have not given you any
visible signs of remembrance
yet believe me the recollection
of you & feelings connected
with that recollection have
almost daily occupied no

small part of my mind. â€“

thoughts.
Whilst new impressions connected
with new scenes in life & with
new relations to the world are
are crowding in upon me I
seem still to retain all
my early ideas as vividly
as ever, I shall never forget
our sympathies & our conversation
