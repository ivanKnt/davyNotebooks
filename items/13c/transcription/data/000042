at penzance when we needed
sympathy & love to enable
us to bear the oppression
of peevishness & folly. –

We can trace back our existence
almost to a point former
time presents us with trains
of thoughts gradually diminishing
to nothing; but our ideas
of futurity are perpetually
expanding our desires & our
hopes even when modified
by fears seem to grasp
at immensity. –
This alone would be sufficient
to prove the progressiveness
of our nature & that this
little earth is but the point
from which we start towards
a perfection that is bounded
only by infinity. –
