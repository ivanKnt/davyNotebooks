to men in great cities which
are the abodes of vice
& of indolence – An active
mind a deep ideal feeling
of good, in look towards
future greatness has preserved
I am thankful to the
spirit who is every where
that I have passed the
most dangerous season of
my life with but few
errors in pursuits which
promise to me at some
future time the honorable
[unclear]meed[/unclear] of the applause
of enlightened men –

I have been fortunate with
regard to my friends
