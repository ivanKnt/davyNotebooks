[deletion]The [[/deletion][deletion]unclear][/deletion][deletion]xxxxxxxxx[/deletion][deletion][/unclear[/deletion]][deletion] flame of sacred love[/deletion]
Early shall his [deletion]dusky[/deletion] eye [insertion]Kindling eye[/insertion]

Proud rolling through its cloud clad way.
Early shall his red lips seek
His [unclear][deletion]xxxxxx[/deletion][/unclear] Mothers love flushed cheek
Or to the vale of pleasure turn
And on her orbed beauties burn
To him the earth the sky the air
Shall teem with life & beauty fair
And He in every form shall see
The lineaments of sympathy
The lightning fires the storms

that move
Through the vaulted heaven above
The meteors deep & awful light
Shall but please his [deletion]wondring[/deletion]
tranquil sight
And the deep loud [deletion]growling[/deletion] [insertion]wonder[/insertion]

thunder
Shall but wake his sleeping
wonder.”
