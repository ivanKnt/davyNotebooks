so wonderfully constituted is
the organisation of man
that pain is uniformly
connected either with breaks
in the associations of
our motions or with
the production of energy
by being modified by
pleasure or with the
separation [deletion]from[/deletion] of
voluntary [deletion]actions[/deletion] from
our general aggregate.
Even the pain of disease
cannot be lost it must
attach itself to some
parts of our nature &
the association of analogy
will direct it where
to attach itself
