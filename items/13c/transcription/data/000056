the minute particles whereof bodies are
composed which attract each other at or near
the point of contact with a force much superior
to that of gravity; but which at any distance
from it decreases much further than the
power of gravity. This power a late ingenious

Chemistry is a science the object of which

is to ascertain the ingredients that enter

into the composition of bodies; to examine

the nature of these ingredients, the manner

in which they combine & the properties resulting

from their combination. –

– All our classifications are in fact artificial

nature does not know them & in fact

will not submit to them. but it is

of use to form analogies as by means

of them the science is much readier

learnt. –

[Horizontal rule]
Gravity is the attraction between bodies so

distant that the masses alone influence

the result & that the power may be

considered as residing in the centre of the

attracting bodies –

Adhesion supposes a distance too small

for our senses. It has been demonstrated

to depend upon the No of touching

points which depends upon the figure

of the particles that form the body
