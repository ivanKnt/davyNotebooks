cohesion takes place only between particles of
the same nature. These instead of touching
in one superficies only as in adhesion
touch in every point where their figure
will allow of contact: consequently the
force of cohesion also must depend upon
the figure of the particles. –

Affinity unites bodies of a different
nature not merely by one superficies
as cohesion does but particle

Quere how far must the old established
law of chemistry be admitted. that no two
bodies can act on each other except one

Since all the details in the preceding
which have proved that the force of attraction
by which compounds are formed is placed
in every body & exists in it in
a determinate degree it is evident that
the phaenomena – [deletion]produced[/deletion] [insertion]occasioned[/insertion] by this force
ought to take place in all the changes
that are produced in the world
& which constitute in their connection

which they are produced ie the phaenomena
