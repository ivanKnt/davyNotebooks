distinct; M[superscript]r[/superscript] Volta considers
the fluids in the common pile
as conductors merely; but none
of them [insertion]are[/insertion] active unless they
be likewise chemical agents: &
their powers are not proportional
to their conducting energy as
for instance the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] with
sulphuric acid. –
When one metal only
is used it is said that
one of the fluids stands
in the place of a metal
but this fluid may be [unclear]indifferabl[/unclear]
either sulphuret of P or water
for instance in the case of the
Tin; & the current of
electricity is determined by
the power of the substance
to act; And in this
respect there is a very
curious relation between different
chemical actions – Thus the
metals which decompose water
