appear to have the current
on the side of part
decomposing water; but
those that act upon sulphuret

of potash & do not
decompose water have the
current on the side of
the sulphuret & where
both actions take place

there is a contest for
the current. –
– . probably Zinc & copper
with double glasses & Zinc
exposed to acid & copper
to [insertion]sulphuret[/insertion] will [deletion]undergo very little[/deletion]
give very little power. – &
still less when the order
is reversed; But Zinc with
acid & copper with caustic
potash will probably act. –
or sulphuret with copper; &
Zinc with concentrated Sulphuric
