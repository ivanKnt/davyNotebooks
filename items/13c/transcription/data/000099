[unclear]Fiedler[/unclear] has observed that

Alumine when suffered
to remain long in contact
with a solution of galls
throws down from it both
extract & Tannin & nothing

remains in the solution
but Gallic acid. –
Acetite of alumine
seems to throw down
extract; but it has
no sensible action upon
Tannin –
Might We not separate
extract from Tannin
by muriate of Alumine.
Then separate the Tannin
by pure alumine & then
separate the acid by lead.
