– Considering this circumstance
however & even allowing
[deletion]for[/deletion] the coarseness of
the [deletion][unclear][deletion]xxxx[/deletion][/unclear][/deletion] exp[superscript]t[/superscript] detailed
it is evident that
the Ex[superscript]t[/superscript] [deletion]of[/deletion] Cat. [deletion]cannot[/deletion]
cannot contain much
less than 2/3 Tannin –
From some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that
have been lately made
it appears that the
best oak bark does
not contain [deletion]more[/deletion] [insertion]so much as[/insertion] than
1/10 Tannin –
So that 1 lb. of Ex[superscript]t[/superscript]
must be worth at least
7.lb. of oak bark.
