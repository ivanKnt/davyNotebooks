As the hydrogene obtained several
times in the experiment with ice
probably arose from a solution of
some of it when the water was
thawed & a subsequent liberation
of it I resolved to try if
when acetate of lead was
dissolved in the water any
gas would appear / In this
case when the oxydating pole

was of copper [deletion]gas did[/deletion] [deletion]appear[/deletion]
in one case there probably
was a little hydrogene but
this was as there is every
reason to believe from the

[insertion]common the predisposed[/insertion] action of copper upon the
water

[Horizontal rule]

Silver was used & in two
experiments; no hydrogene was
evolved; nor was any lead revived
during the thawing of the ice â€“
