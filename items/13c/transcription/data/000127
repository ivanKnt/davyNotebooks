At the end of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
the water was taken out
of the glass – & in consequence
on account of the permeability
of the gold beaters skin
much of the fluids were
lost about 3 gr[superscript]s[/superscript] of H[superscript][unclear]wr[/unclear][/superscript] &

2 of O[superscript][unclear]wr[/unclear][/superscript] were however
preserved for examination –

NB. a whitish matter
had fallen to the bottom in

the neg[superscript]e[/superscript] tube; [unclear]2x[/unclear] from the glass
