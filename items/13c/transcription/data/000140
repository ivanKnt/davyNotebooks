[deletion]What once was beauty & form[/deletion]
[deletion]Is mouldering dust. –[/deletion]
[deletion]What once was strength & power[/deletion]

[deletion]Is still beneath the turf –[/deletion]

Is there aught in your dying forms

That gave to my Spirit energy. –
Was the blood that rolled through
your veins. –
The infant germ of my power

[Horizontal rule]
that whiten it came
From the breath & the spirit
of man. –

[Horizontal rule]
Thoughts roll not beneath
the dust. –

No feeling is in the
cold grave. –
Neither thought nor feeling
can die –
They have passed to other
