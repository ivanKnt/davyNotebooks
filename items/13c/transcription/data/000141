My eye is wet with tears
For I see the white stones
That are covered with names –
The stones of my forefathers
graves. –

[Horizontal rule]
No grass grows upon them
For deep in the earth.

In darkness & silence the organs

of life

To their primitive atoms return

Through ages the[deletion]ir[/deletion] air [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]

Has been moist with their blood

Through ages the seeds of

the thistle has fed

On what was once motion & [deletion]life[/deletion] [insertion]form[/insertion]

[Horizontal rule]

The white cloud that floats
through the heavens

Is pregnant, with [deletion]what[/deletion]

that which was life

And the moon beams
