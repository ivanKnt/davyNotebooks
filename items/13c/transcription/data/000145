Behind that rock the dark blue sky
First gave to thee her
thousand lights
[deletion]It is not natures work[/deletion]
A little [deletion]hill with grass is green[/deletion]
That round it gently flows
A little pile of ground is seen
[deletion]Around[/deletion] [insertion]About[/insertion] it the white thistle grows.
Its top with [deletion]dusky[/deletion] grass is green
Waving as the Zephyr blows.
