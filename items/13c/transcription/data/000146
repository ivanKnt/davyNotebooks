Such are the feelings chance or Nature give
They warm our bosoms while the senses live
To me no shaping intellect had given
The moral sense the living fire of heaven.
My wild untutored intellect ne’er saw
The living light of natures sacred law. –

[Horizontal rule]
Thus whilst intensely on the raptured sight
Lives the eternal mountains wooded height
Fair with the green the white the purple 

ray. – 
And mingling with the vast 

expansive sea. –
The murmurs of the mountain torrent 

die
The bounded intellect exists in eye. –
Where the rock of stature tall
Hangs oer the green descending hill
Beside the murmuring fall
Of the mountain rill
First upon thy cold blue cheek
Did the breeze of [deletion]summer[/deletion] [insertion]evening[/insertion] play
Behind that rock thou first dost

seek

The falling star of day. –
