To him no more the mighty past arose
Majestic with its splendid images
No more to him the obscurity of time
was bright & splendid
Weary & faint despair was on his soul
A vacancy of though a painful listlessness 
Such as the fever worn wretch

– who long. –
In agony. & felt the blood roll
burning through his Veins
