Now to the wanderers dull & tearful eye
Oft turned towards the blue & misty nile
The unfinished piles shone dimly visible
In the last rays of evening. His tired feet
Moved on so wearily that scarce the sound

Of life or motion shook the parched air
[deletion]Suspended motionless above the sands[/deletion]
He long had travelled. For the fear of death
And rapid vengeance nerved his youthful 

limbs
No pleasant feelings cheered him 

for the thoughts

The renovated thoughts of former days rose in
their dimness – But they mingled
not with the dark unknown

Future. Still He travelled till

before him spread the mighty
desart. As its skirted bounds
where the green verdure grew
he bent his steps. whilst above
him rolled diffusive of creative light
in their immeasurable rounds
the glorious stars. –
