cohesion takes place only between particles of

[person]person_199|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Volta[/person] & many of the foreign
philosophers adopt this last opinion
& support it by an exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
esteemed fundamental; namely
that when two metals are
brought in contact & separated
they are found in opposite states
of electricity; but this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
does not in the least show
that the phaenomenon is owing
to their arrangement: for chemical
agencies such as those of the
atmosphere may be concerned: &
[deletion]though the action of[/deletion] the
Mechanical action of the metals
may produce the effect &
there is no reason from the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
of adopting the [unclear]new[/unclear] principle of
a constant circulation of the
electricity. –
It is not necessary that
we should ascertain if chemical
agencies be concerned in the fundamental
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it will be sufficient to
us to shew their power in

distinct; [person]person_199|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Volta[/person] considers
the fluids in the common pile
as conductors merely; but none
of them [insertion]are[/insertion] active unless they
be likewise chemical agents: &
their powers are not proportional
to their conducting energy as
for instance the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] with
[chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical]. –
When one metal only
is used it is said that
one of the fluids stands
in the place of a metal
but this fluid may be [unclear]indifferabl[/unclear]
either sulphuret of P or water
for instance in the case of the
[chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical]; & the current of
electricity is determined by
the power of the substance
to act; And in this
respect there is a very
curious relation between different
chemical actions – Thus the
metals which decompose water

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11303-000-00078|000078|000078[/page]
appear to have the current
on the side of part
decomposing water; but
those that act upon sulphuret
of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] & do not
decompose water have the
current on the side of
the sulphuret & where
both actions take place
there is a contest for
the current. –

acid; but [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] with solution

Moved on so wearily that scarce the sound
Of life or motion shook the parched air

And rapid vengeance nerved his youthful 
limbs
No pleasant feelings cheered him 
for the thoughts
The renovated thoughts of former days rose in
their dimness – But they mingled
not with the dark unknown
Future. Still He travelled till
before him spread the mighty
desart. As its skirted bounds
where the green verdure grew
he bent his steps. whilst above
him rolled diffusive of creative light
in their immeasurable rounds
the glorious stars. –
