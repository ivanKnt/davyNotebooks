Here my opening mind: –

[deletion]First[/deletion] In the [deletion]mingled[/deletion] [insertion]expressive[/insertion] harmony of voice
And speaking countenace; [deletion]expressive[/deletion] [insertion]astonished[/insertion] read
Another’s thoughts. –

[deletion]confiding in my powers I [/deletion][deletion]ev[/deletion]

Are past O scene beloved [insertion]many days[/insertion] since last my eyes
Many days are past, beloved scene
Since first my – Many days are past
Beloved scene since last my wet eyes saw
The moonbeams gild thy whitely foaming waves.
Ambitious then confiding in her powers
Spurning her prison onward flew my soul
To mingle with her kindred, In the breeze
That wafts upon its wings futurity
To hear the voice of praise. –
And Not in vain
Have those high hopes existed [deletion]not in vain[/deletion] 

Not in vain
[deletion]Amidst the change of life my soul[/deletion]
[deletion]Has [/deletion][deletion]ai[/deletion]m’d
The dew of labor has oppressed my brow.
On which the rose of pleasure never glowd.

For I have tasted of that sacred stream
