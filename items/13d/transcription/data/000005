Here thro’ the trembling moonshine of the grove
My earliest lays were wafted by the breeze
And here my kindling spirit learnt to trace
The mystic laws. from whose high energy
The moving atoms in eternal change
Still rise to animation. –
Not like the bubble on the sea of life
That rises glitters with the sunbeam
& there dies for ever
No rose of pleasure e’er has crowned my brows

Nor have I listened to the golden harp
Of pale eyed indolence. –
I have not lived
A burthen of the earth

[Horizontal rule]
Of [deletion]novel[/deletion] science whose delicous water flows
From Nature’s bosom. – I have felt the warm
The gentle influence of congenial souls
Whose kindred hopes have cheered me.
Who have taught
My irritable spirit how to bear
Injustice. [deletion]How to scorn the stings of those[/deletion]
