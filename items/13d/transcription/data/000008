– The solitary. –

Aithe was mine & I was happy
that feeling which had been attached
to the beautiful & [deletion]sublime[/deletion] [insertion]majestic[/insertion] in nature
that ever living & sublime energy which
had still illumined my days which
had still burnt in my bosom
the source of an immortal activity
was now increased & modified by
new enjoyments – One tribe of perceptions
occupied the whole of my attention
[deletion]And [/deletion][deletion]Aithe[/deletion] How often when satisfied
with pleasurable impressions when tired
even by the variety of present
enjoyment in the company of my
beloved. How often have I retired
amidst forests shut out of
man inattentive to nature &
occupied only by her idea –
How was this said I to myself
is it not that hope that intellectual
feeling is sometimes even more
pleasurable than enjoyment, or rather
