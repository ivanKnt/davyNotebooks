do not all the habits of thinking
& acting in human life render
an alternation of the two
necessary – Then would
the recollections of former
days crowd upon my mind
connected with all the repressed
& modified feelings which had
been the motives of my
actions, Amidst the delightful
scenery of the wye, I was
sometimes for a short time
a physiopatheist, In my
Library I was sometimes
ambitious & the voice of fame
stole to me in my dreams
Amidst the moonbeams & the
blue sky I was sometimes
devout – but these transitions
of passion were momentary &
still I burned to Aithe. –
