Aiga was lying on his couch his
cheeks were pale & thin, his nose
pointed; but his dark eyes
glistened with all their original
fire, a transient flush of
rapture passed over his cheek
as he saw me approach
his bed & whilst I felt
the hard grasp of his moist

hand, I saw tears trickle down
his cheek. – We were silent
it was with difficulty that
I could repress my tears, the
pure sympathies of friendship
are perhaps infinitely stronger
than any there not only
direct association tends to
give them strength: but a
thousand nameless sympathies
of analogy, organs similarity
of mind, of character all
combine to give them strength
& energy. –
