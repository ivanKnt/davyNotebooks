never chill those [insertion]burning[/insertion] energies connected
with the thoughts of future
existence. – I feel & I believe
that the genial warmth of
the sun of immortality, which
has shone through this shattered
frame with feeble light
shall be more permanent
in the regions of bliss. I feel
within me new energies. –
these hopes do not announce
pain or annihilation. O
happy man. – O benevolent
deity thou art every where
existing & where thy
pure essence is interfused
pain cannot permanent
there is no pure pain
