The philosophers grew warm. the Eldest
who wore a black coat said
matter is nothing but motion
& c – the other said so & so –
You said the silent philosopher
both agree with me that
you have no Knowledge that
is not derived from the senses
of cours. M.B. cannot have
any Knowledge of his imaterial
principle & you both
allow that matter is likewise
an unknown thing, the question
then is this whether thinking
arises from the action of many
unknown things upon each other or
of one unknown thing upon
many unknown things. My friends
my friends Why will ye build
up an idol of language & then
quarrel whether ye shall worship
it on your knees or standing
