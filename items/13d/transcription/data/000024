23
I gradually began to invent
& form stories of my own
perhaps this passion has
produced all my originality
I never had a memory
I never loved to imitate but
always to invent. this
has been in the case
in all the sciences that
I have studied – hence
many of my errors

[Horizontal rule]
Sun then ever sinking behind the
dark clouds they hide thy refulgence
from my sight; but still thy
light is diffused over
innumerable regions still it warms
it delights ten millions
of happy beings, it will warm
it will enlighten when
I am no more here all
is change nothing is permanent
nothing lasting –
