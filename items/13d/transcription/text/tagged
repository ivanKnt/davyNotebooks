Aithe was mine & I was happy

to the beautiful & [deletion]sublime[/deletion] [insertion]majestic[/insertion] in nature
that ever living & sublime energy which

[deletion]And Aithe[/deletion] How often when satisfied

How was this said I to myself
is it not that hope that intellectual
feeling is sometimes even more
pleasurable than enjoyment, or rather

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11304-000-00009|000009|000009[/page]
do not all the habits of thinking

an alternation of the two
necessary – Then would
the recollections of former
days crowd upon my mind
connected with all the repressed

been the motives of my
actions, Amidst the delightful

July 11. To day for the first time
in my life I have had a
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]distinct[/insertion] sympathy with nature
I was lying on the top of a
rock in leeward, the wind
was high & every thing in
motion, the branches of an oak
above were waving & murmuring
to the breeze, yellow clouds
deepened by grey at the base
were [insertion]rapidly[/insertion] floating over the western
hills the whole sky was
in motion, the yellow stream
Agitated by the breeze
below me was likewise flowing
is this analogy? – Every

seemed alive & myself part of
the series of visible impression
I should have felt pain in
tearing a leaf from one of
the trees – deeply
& intimately connected are all
our ideas of motion & life –
& – this probably from
very early associations
how different is the idea
of life in a [unclear]philsiologist[/unclear]

how often have I been [unclear]amaxxx[/unclear] by
the arts –
The court was at this time engaged

this destination would have been
pleasing to me. For a moment my
former ambition was awakened &
the flush of rapture warmed my 
cheek on the thoughts of
that people who had crowned 
my brows with the laurels
of science & who had listened
to the wild & simple harp
of a son of the mountains –
But this feeling was transient
love domestic tenderness & the
long train of ideas connected with
hopes [unclear]laxxxted[/unclear] to one spot resumed
the empire of the mind. –
I parted from aithe with sorrow
I had none of those presentiments
which the vulgar upon reflecting
on the state of their minds before
an event & after imagine they

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11304-000-00013|000013|000013[/page]
have perceived when they modify
& mingle their feelings. –
The voyage was like most of my
voyages uninteresting, bodily &
mental pain coexisted. & I made
no reflections of sufficient
importance to produce effects upon
individuals in general. I recollect
that time appeared to me longer
than usually doubtless because
I connected a greater number
of terms [deletion]with[/deletion] expressing time
with the passing ideas / though
afterwards it appeared to me
shorter than before because it
was connected with no strong feelings

Aiga was lying on his couch his
cheeks were pale & thin, his nose
pointed; but his dark eyes
glistened with all their original
fire, a transient flush of
rapture passed over his cheek
as he saw me approach
his bed & whilst I felt
the hard grasp of his moist
hand, I saw tears trickle down
his cheek. – We were silent
it was with difficulty that
I could repress my tears, the
pure sympathies of friendship
are perhaps infinitely stronger
than any there not only
direct association tends to
give them strength: but a
thousand nameless sympathies
of analogy, organs similarity
of mind, of character all
combine to give them strength
& energy. –

we were both in health & vigor
