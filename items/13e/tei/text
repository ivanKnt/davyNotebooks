The present and future happiness of Man.-<lb/>
- To preserve this Religion after the death<lb/>
of its founder, a Revelation was given<lb/>
to Man in the new Testament, which<lb/>
was to be the standard of faith, the<lb/>
law of life and Manners and the<lb/>
certain conductor to present and<lb/>
eternal happiness.<lb/>
It is to this Revelation that all Christians<lb/>
must appeal in their religious controversies,<lb/>
and by this their opinions must be deter=<lb/>

composed in the east, in a country where<lb/>

Passages in the new testament are<lb/>

understood in their true sense. In deter=<lb/>
mining the meaning of those words<lb/>

by reason, the first revelation, the only<lb/>
faculty whereby man can distinguish<lb/>
Truth from falshood - In examining the<lb/>
scriptures by the test of reason, we discover<lb/>
nothing which favors your doctrines<lb/>
The passages which are against it are<lb/>

The muscles are composed of irritable fibres, these fibres<lb/>
when seperated from each other, still preserve their<lb/>
irritability &amp; contract on the application of stimuli<lb/>
each fibre and each portion of a fibre is irritable<lb/>
 this irritability is governd by certain laws -<lb/>
- The laws of Irritability -<lb/>
Law 1<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                rend="superscript">st</hi>. The irritable fibre is possess'd of a certain<lb/>
power which is necessary to its contraction, this is<lb/>
call'd irritability, this irritable principle appears to<lb/>
combine with the fibre &amp; to be a substance seperated<lb/>
from the blood. - proof of this law, stimulate a muscular<lb/>
fibre for a certain time and it will cease to contract<lb/>
which proves that its irritability is exhausted, in a living<lb/>
subject after some time it will again become contractile<lb/>
which proves that <del xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

2.<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                rend="superscript">d</hi>. The action of the irritable fibre and of course<lb/>
the effect produc'd upon it, is in a ratio compounded<lb/>
of the quantity of its irritability &amp; the force of the<lb/>
stimulus. the same stimulus will produce greater<lb/>
contraction, on a fibre more irritable than on one less<lb/>
irritable &amp; the irritability of the fibre being the same<lb/>
the action of the fibre will be greater upon the application<lb/>

in the inverse ratio of the repetition of its application<lb/>

There are three different states of the irritable fibre<lb/>
or three different degrees of irritability to which it<lb/>
is liable.<lb/>
The first, is the State of health or<lb/>
 tone of the fibre. -<lb/>
2 The state of accumulation produc'd<lb/>
 by the absence of habitual stimuli -<lb/>
3 The state of exhaustion produc'd<lb/>
 by the too powerful operation of stimuli -<lb/>
1<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                rend="superscript">st</hi>. The state of health or the tone of the fibre consists<lb/>
in a certain quantity of the irritable principle necessary<lb/>
to its preservation, to maintain this state, the action<lb/>
of the stimulus must be sufficiently powerful, to carry<lb/>
of from the fibre the surplus of this irritable principle<lb/>
which the blood is continually supplying - for this<lb/>
a certain equilibrium is necessary between the stimuli<lb/>
applied &amp; the irritability of the fibre or b = c<lb/>

                rend="superscript">d</hi> When the sum of the stimuli acting upon the fibre<lb/>
is not sufficient to carry of its surplus of Irritability,<lb/>
the irritable principle accumulates in the fibre, then<lb/>

The irritability is augmented &amp; the stimuli produce much<lb/>
 stronger contractions, than in the state of health. -<lb/>

is too great, then is the irritability of the fibre<lb/>
exhausted, and this exaustion is either temporary<lb/>
or irreparable, -...-- when temporary after a certain<lb/>
time it again possesses the contractiless; when irreparable<lb/>
it ceases to exist &amp; becomes gangrenous. -<lb/>

When the irritable fibre has lost its tone, it is either a disease<lb/>
of accumulation or a disease of exhaustion. When a fibre is diseased<lb/>
the whole system is diseased by law 6<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

a fibre is exhausted by a too powerful stimulus, the irritability<lb/>
- is restored from the common irritability of the whole system.<lb/>
If this stimulus is sufficiently powerful to exhaust the irritability<lb/>
of the whole system, death is the consequence of this exhaustion.<lb/>
 - When the habitual stimulus of an irritable fibre is taken<lb/>
away an accumulation of irritability is the consequence<lb/>
which accumulation is communicated to the whole system.<lb/>

1. Bodies are different. &amp; are distinguishable<lb/>
from each other by peculiar properties. -<lb/>
 2 The specific differences of bodies as ascertained<lb/>
by comparing our sensations -<lb/>
3. From the specific differences of bodies<lb/>

 5 By attraction the corpuscles of<lb/>
bodies exist in a state of contiguity<lb/>
By Repulsion they separate from each<lb/>
 other.<lb/>
 6 Repulsion can be communicated from<lb/>
one body to another. -<lb/>
7. Attractions of particles are different<lb/>
&amp; of the chemical Attraction -<lb/>
8. By the chemical Attractions some<lb/>
particles are capable of stronger attraction<lb/>

We know as well that certain bodies having their<lb/>
repulsive powers increased by any chemical or<lb/>

the repulsive powers of the particles of other bodies<lb/>
the phenomena of repulsion have been supposed by the<lb/>

quantities of latent heat upon which their peculiar<lb/>

the repulsive power of bodies was nothing more<lb/>
than the seperation of their particles by this fluid<lb/>
When a body became more expanded according<lb/>
to this system Caloric was added to it when<lb/>
by insinuating itself between the corpuscules<lb/>

When bodies communicated the repulsive power<lb/>

The particles of bodies attract each other<lb/>
All bodies are endowed with the power of attraction<lb/>
&amp; all bodies with which we are aecquainted appear<lb/>
capable of existing in three forms the solid fluid<lb/>
&amp; gaseous in each of these forms, the particles<lb/>
of matter are still attractive; but the attraction<lb/>
is proportionally weaker as the body becomes<lb/>
more expanded, all bodies with which <hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

before consequently their particles are not in actual<lb/>
contact - For since matter is impenetrable if<lb/>
the particles of steam were in actual contact they<lb/>
coud never approach nearer to each other<lb/>

There must then consequently as well as a<lb/>

which power the particles of bodies are prevented<lb/>

are expanded; We find that bodies are expanded<lb/>
