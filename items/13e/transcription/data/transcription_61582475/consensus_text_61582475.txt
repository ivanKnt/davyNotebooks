in a state of perfect health; the spirits
rise sometimes almost to madness, trains
of pleasurable ideas producing raptures introduce
themselves into the Mind, all the ideas
of self excellence are enlarged, at this time
if the affected Person has religious
emotions, He imagines himself to be
the peculiar favorite of the Deity.
The vivid appearances of the ideas, and
the wild and uncommon mode of their
 Association dispose him to beleive them to
be the inspiration of the Deity.
This Enthusiasm tho' rare at first promoted
and indulged in becomes at length habitual
and increased in a very high degree
