- Memoir the first -
The muscles are composed of irritable fibres, these fibres
when seperated from each other, still preserve their
irritability & contract on the application of stimuli
each fibre and each portion of a fibre is irritable
 this irritability is governd by certain laws -
- The laws of Irritability -
Law 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. The irritable fibre is possess'd of a certain
power which is necessary to its contraction, this is
call'd irritability, this irritable principle appears to
combine with the fibre & to be a substance seperated
from the blood. - proof of this law, stimulate a muscular
fibre for a certain time and it will cease to contract
which proves that its irritability is exhausted, in a living
subject after some time it will again become contractile
which proves that [deletion]irritability[/deletion] [insertion]the contractile power[/insertion] is owing to some principle
as yet unknown, but which we shall call Irritability
2.[superscript]d[/superscript]. The action of the irritable fibre and of course
the effect produc'd upon it, is in a ratio compounded
of the quantity of its irritability & the force of the
stimulus. the same stimulus will produce greater
contraction, on a fibre more irritable than on one less
irritable & the irritability of the fibre being the same
the action of the fibre will be greater upon the application
