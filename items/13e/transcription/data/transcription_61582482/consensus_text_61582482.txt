of a stronger than of a weaker stimulus.
3[superscript]d[/superscript]. The effect produc'd upon an irritable fibre is
in the inverse ratio of the repetition of its application
ceteris paribus the effect of any stimulus diminishes
every time its application is repeated, till at last it
is = D. For example the sensitive plant exposed to a
strong wind contracts, but ceases soon to contract from
 the repetition of the stimulus, th[deletion]u[/deletion]is explains the phenom.
 of habit - [deletion]from the[/deletion] 2[superscript]d[/superscript] & 3[superscript]d[/superscript] we obtain the 4[superscript]th[/superscript] -
4[superscript]th[/superscript]. The effect produc'd on any fibre, by any stimulus
is a ratio compounded of the degree of irritability of the
fibre & the force of the stimulus directly & the habit of
the fibre inversely. thus let the force of the stimulus
= b, the irritability of the fibre = c & the habit of
the fibre = d. then will x or the effect produced on
the fibre be - x = bc/d but d or the habit of the
fibre is included under c or its irritability therfore x = bc.
5[superscript]th[/superscript] The irritable fibre from the moment of its existence
to that of its disolution is in a state of action -
it is constantly surrounded by a body which acts
upon it and upon which it reacts. The existence
 of the irritable fibre [underline]then[/underline] consists in action -
6 When any stimulus is applied to any irritable
fibre, all the fibres of the system are susceptible of
that stimulus, that is all the fibres communicate Irritability
