There are three different states of the irritable fibre
or three different degrees of irritability to which it
is liable.
The first, is the State of health or
 tone of the fibre. -
2 The state of accumulation produc'd
 by the absence of habitual stimuli -
3 The state of exhaustion produc'd
 by the too powerful operation of stimuli -
1[superscript]st[/superscript]. The state of health or the tone of the fibre consists
in a certain quantity of the irritable principle necessary
to its preservation, to maintain this state, the action
of the stimulus must be sufficiently powerful, to carry
of from the fibre the surplus of this irritable principle
which the blood is continually supplying - for this
a certain equilibrium is necessary between the stimuli
applied & the irritability of the fibre or b = c
2[superscript]d[/superscript] When the sum of the stimuli acting upon the fibre
is not sufficient to carry of its surplus of Irritability,
the irritable principle accumulates in the fibre, then
is the irritability in the state of e[deletion]xxxxxx[/deletion]Accumulation
The irritability is augmented & the stimuli produce much
 stronger contractions, than in the state of health. -
