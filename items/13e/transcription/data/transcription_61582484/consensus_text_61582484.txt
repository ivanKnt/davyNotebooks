is too great, then is the irritability of the fibre
exhausted, and this exaustion is either temporary
or irreparable, -...-- when temporary after a certain
time it again possesses the contractiless; when irreparable
it ceases to exist & becomes gangrenous. -
The phenomena of sleep, drunkenness, drowsiness after exertion
are explain'd by the last. - Refreshment after sleep, Hunger,

When the irritable fibre has lost its tone, it is either a disease
of accumulation or a disease of exhaustion. When a fibre is diseased
the whole system is diseased by law 6[superscript]th[/superscript]. If the irritability of
a fibre is exhausted by a too powerful stimulus, the irritability
- is restored from the common irritability of the whole system.
If this stimulus is sufficiently powerful to exhaust the irritability
of the whole system, death is the consequence of this exhaustion.
 - When the habitual stimulus of an irritable fibre is taken
away an accumulation of irritability is the consequence
which accumulation is communicated to the whole system.
