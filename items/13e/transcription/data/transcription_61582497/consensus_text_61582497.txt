How do we gain the idea of a mathematical
 Triangle [unclear]in[/unclear] a being that has three
sides & three ∠ -
Answer, all Triangles that we have seen
are representations on the retina of a space
of a peculiar figure included by three right
lines - the [unclear]first[/unclear] Triangle seen supposed
to be right angled - the next we see
oblique ∠[superscript]d[/superscript]- The oblique angled Triangle
raises in our mind by the association of
resemblance of the oblique ∠[superscript]d[/superscript] - If we afterwards
see an obtuse ∠[superscript]d[/superscript] [Ink sketch of a triangle] it will probably
 raise the ideas of the others & these by
being frequently raised in successive
association will at length be raised
synchronically & hence will a peculiar
Complex idea of a triangle exist in
 the mind - [deletion]is this the case or rather
is not our idea of a triangle some[/deletion]
Whenever we see a peculiar figure with
three sides & three ∠[superscript][unclear]2[/unclear][superscript] it directly raises by
 association, the complex idea a [Ink sketch of a triangle]
