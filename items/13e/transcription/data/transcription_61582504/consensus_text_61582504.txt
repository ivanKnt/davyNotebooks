We know as well that certain bodies having their
repulsive powers increased by any chemical or
mechanical motion have the power of increasin,
the repulsive powers of the particles of other bodies
the phenomena of repulsion have been supposed by the
greater part of chemical Philosophers to depend
upon a certain elastic fluid to which the names
of latent heat & Caloric have been given - It
has been supposed, that all bodies have certain
quantities of latent heat upon which their peculiar
states of solidity, fluidity & gasety depend & that
the repulsive power of bodies was nothing more
than the seperation of their particles by this fluid
When a body became more expanded according
to this system Caloric was added to it when
by insinuating itself between the corpuscules
 seperated them & filled up the void space -
When bodies communicated the repulsive power
to other Bodies they become less expanded
The advocates for the matter of Heat that [deletion]xx[/deletion]
this diminution of expansion arises from the
subtraction of part of their Caloric â€“ However
adequate may be this theory to explain the [unclear]phenomenon[/unclear]
We must not admit it without proof - For that
theory which admits not of Calorie is equaly
adequate to the explanation of the phenomena
Exp[superscript]t[/superscript] then is the test to which we ought to
submit the both theories & if we can prove
