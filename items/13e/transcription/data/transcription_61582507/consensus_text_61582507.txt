The particles of bodies attract each other
All bodies are endowed with the power of attraction
& all bodies with which we are acquainted appear
capable of existing in three forms the solid fluid
& gaseous in each of these forms, the particles
of matter are still attractive; but the attraction
is proportionately weaker as the body becomes
more expanded, all bodies with which [underline]we[/underline] are
acquainted can be made to pile up less space than
acquainted can be made to fill up less space than
before consequently their particles are not in actual
contact - For since matter is [unclear]impenetrable[/unclear] if
the particles of steam were in actual contact they
coud never approach nearer to each other
[deletion]Nor coud[/deletion] they [deletion]ever[/deletion] [insertion]consequently could not[/insertion] pile up less space than before
There must then consequently as well as a
attractive power exist a repulsive power by 
which power the particles of bodies are prevented
from being in actual contact - We find that bodies
are expanded; We find that bodies are expanded
when their particles are caused to vibrate
[unclear]or[/unclear] move by the impression of an external force
 in by friction & percussion, We find likewise
that they are expanded when [deletion]xx[/deletion] their bodies
which have a greater quantity of the repulsive
power are brought in contact with them
We consequently know that a peculiar kind of
motion is capable of adding to bodies repulsive
power or of diminishing the attractive power -
