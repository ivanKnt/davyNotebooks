            The particles of bodies attract each other<br xml:id="">
            All bodies are endowed with the power of attraction<br xml:id="">
            &amp; all bodies with which we are aecquainted appear<br xml:id="">
            capable of existing in three forms the solid fluid<br xml:id="">
            &amp; gaseous in each of these forms, the particles<br xml:id="">
            of matter are still attractive; but the attraction<br xml:id="">
            is proportionally weaker as the body becomes<br xml:id="">
            more expanded, all bodies with which <em class="underline">we</em> are<br xml:id="">
            accquainted can be made to fill up less space than<br xml:id="">
            before consequently their particles are not in actual<br xml:id="">
            contact - For since matter is impenetrable if<br xml:id="">
            the particles of steam were in actual contact they<br xml:id="">
            coud never approach nearer to each other<br xml:id="">
            <span class="strikethrough wordstrike-n" title="Deleted Text">Nor coud</span> they <span class="strikethrough wordstrike-n" title="Deleted Text">ever</span>

            There must then consequently as well as a<br xml:id="">
            attractive power exist a repulsive power by <br xml:id="">
            which power the particles of bodies are prevented<br xml:id="">
            from being in actual contact - We find that bodies<br xml:id="">
            are expanded; We find that bodies are expanded<br xml:id="">
            when their particles are caused to vibrate<br xml:id="">
            or move by the impression of an external force<br xml:id="">
            ie by friction &amp; percussion, We find likewise<br xml:id="">
            that they are expanded when <span class="strikethrough wordstrike-n" title="Deleted Text">xx</span> Other bodies<br xml:id="">
            which have a greater quantity of the repulsive<br xml:id="">
            power are brought in contact with them<br xml:id="">
            We consequently know that a peculiar kind of<br xml:id="">
            motion is capable of adding to bodies repulsive<br xml:id="">
            power or of diminishing the attractive power -<br xml:id="">
