A Letter on the pretended Inspiration
- of the Quakers and other Sectaries -
[Horizontal rule]
- You profess to beleive in the present
existence of spiritual influence on the human
 Mind; An influence, for the nonexistence
of which, I contended in a late conversation.
You have in this letter my objections to
your doctrines; objections which have just
occurred to me, and which are the result
neither of a laborious investigation, or
minute enquiry. [Horizontal rule]
The Christian Religion is distinguished
from all others, by the grand and compre=
=hensive truths which form its basis,

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00006|dnp13e004pp|61582469[/page]
By its pure and simple moral precepts, and
by the sublimity and unity of its [deletion]dessign[/deletion] [insertion]design[/insertion],
The present and future happiness of Man.
- To preserve this Religion after the death
of its founder, a Revelation was given
to Man in the new Testament, which
was to be the standard of faith, the
law of life and Manners and the
certain conductor to present and
eternal happiness.
It is to this Revelation that all Christians
must appeal in their religious controversies,
and by this their opinions must be deter=
mined:- But as the new testament was
composed in the east, in a country where
the common Language was poetical, full
[deletion]of[/deletion]

5
of figurative expressions, Metaphor and
 Hyperbole; a Number of words and
Passages in the new testament are
now equivocal and difficult to be
understood in their true sense. In deter=
mining the meaning of those words
and passages we must be guided
by reason, the first revelation, the only
faculty whereby man can distinguish
Truth from falshood - In examining the
scriptures by the test of reason, we discover
nothing which favors your doctrines
The passages which are against it are
too numerous to quote; the absurdity of
it may be demonstrated from the
very nature of revelation. [Horizontal rule]

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00008|dnp13e006pp|61582471[/page]
The new Testament you acknowledge
is a revelation, You acknowledge
that it contains all that is essential
to Salvation: Now if the beleif
and practice of the doctrines contained
in the new Testament are sufficient
to ensure to us present and eternal
happiness; then are all other Revelations
all other inspirations unnecessary. -
But [insertion]If[/insertion] you say Man must be inspired
to understand Scripture in its true
or what you call spiritual sense:
We will [insertion]*[/insertion] answer you by the difference
of opinions of the inspired, The Roman
Catholic and Quaker, The Calvinist

and Methodist pretend alike to Inspiration,
and use it in preaching doctrines totally
different: [deletion]indeed we rarely find two[/deletion]
[deletion]of same sect, who explain[/deletion] Indeed we
rarely find exact uniformity of opinion
amidst the inspired professors of the
same general tenets. [Horizontal rule]
I readily allow that the Apostles and
Disciples of Jesus Christ were inspired,
for it was by inspiration alone that
they could preach the gospel: there
was then no written law but when
the new testament was published
the necessity for inspiration ceased,
All Men who possessed that book had
a revelation, had all that was necessary

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00010|dnp13e008pp|61582473[/page]
to their own Salvation and the Salvation
of others. - If you have spirit, it must
be the same spirit as the Apostles
had, and consequently the fruits of the
Spirit should be display'd in your
actions; They spoke with tongues, they
foretold future events, they wrought
miracles, They renounced the world
with all its pleasures and enjoyments;
But you do none of these things,
You do not by any actions prove the
existence of the spirit in your minds.
You tell us you feel it so do the
Enthusiasts of every Religion, The
Mahometans, the Guebres, and the

Bonzes of India, and some of these
preform actions which assure us of the
Sincerity of their beleif; The Bonzes chain
themselves hand and foot for life, and
preform even more rigid penances, beleiving
that they shall enjoy eternal happiness
as a recompence for their voluntary
Misery-
 The Human Mind, particularly in a state,
of ignorance, is liable to the influence
of Enthusiasm and Superstition: and
these passions seemingly opposite, are
often found in the same person,
and domineer over the Mind alternately.
In a person of irritable temperament, when
the organization is perfect, and the body

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00012|dnp13e010pp|61582475[/page]
in a state of perfect health; the spirits
rise sometimes almost to madness, trains
of pleasurable ideas producing raptures introduce
themselves into the Mind, all the ideas
of self excellence are enlarged, at this time
if the affected Person has religious
emotions, He imagines himself to be
the peculiar favorite of the Deity.
The vivid appearances of the ideas, and
the wild and uncommon mode of their
 Association dispose him to beleive them to
be the inspiration of the Deity.
This Enthusiasm tho' rare at first promoted
and indulged in becomes at length habitual
and increased in a very high degree

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00013|dnp13e011pp|61582476[/page]

 is absolute Insanity * [Horizontal rule]
A Person of the same temperament becoming
nervous and hypochondriacal, constantly under
the influence of disagreeable and melancholy
ideas, if religiously inclined is apt to imagine
himself under the displeasure of the Deity
and the Judgment of eternal condemnation.
These ideas are ever prevalent in the Mind,
and at lenth drive the unhappy sufferer
into a state of Despondency. -
- Man is from his nature liable to
error, to deceive himself and to deceive
others, It is in the nature of those mental
distempers before mentioned, that ideas
are mistaken for realities, Illusions of Fancy
* Of this we had lately a remarkable instance in
Brothers -

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00014|dnp13e012pp|61582477[/page]
for the suggestions of Reason; and to these
distempers all mankind are more or
less subject; it is from the[deletion]se[/deletion][insertion]m[/insertion] [deletion]causes[/deletion]
then, joined with the numerous passions
and prejudices, to which Man is liable,
that we must account for his religious
Errors. [Horizontal rule]
A moderate degree of rational Scepticism
is useful to man, it may preserve him
from disagreeable Mistakes and some=
=times from fatal errors. As long as we
can prove the possibility of your being
mistaken, so long must we doubt of
the truth of your opinions: Internal
feelings which may easily be accounted
for from the nature of the Human mind
are not even the shadows of proofs.

- Memoir the first -
The muscles are composed of irritable fibres, these fibres
when seperated from each other, still preserve their
irritability & contract on the application of stimuli
each fibre and each portion of a fibre is irritable
 this irritability is governd by certain laws -
- The laws of Irritability -
Law 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. The irritable fibre is possess'd of a certain
power which is necessary to its contraction, this is
call'd irritability, this irritable principle appears to
combine with the fibre & to be a substance seperated
from the blood. - proof of this law, stimulate a muscular
fibre for a certain time and it will cease to contract
which proves that its irritability is exhausted, in a living
subject after some time it will again become contractile
which proves that [deletion]irritability[/deletion] [insertion]the contractile power[/insertion] is owing to some principle
as yet unknown, but which we shall call Irritability
2.[superscript]d[/superscript]. The action of the irritable fibre and of course
the effect produc'd upon it, is in a ratio compounded
of the quantity of its irritability & the force of the
stimulus. the same stimulus will produce greater
contraction, on a fibre more irritable than on one less
irritable & the irritability of the fibre being the same
the action of the fibre will be greater upon the application

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00019|dnp13e017pp|61582482[/page]
17
of a stronger than of a weaker stimulus.
3[superscript]d[/superscript]. The effect produc'd upon an irritable fibre is
in the inverse ratio of the repetition of its application
ceteris paribus the effect of any stimulus diminishes
every time its application is repeated, till at last it
is = D. For example the sensitive plant exposed to a
strong wind contracts, but ceases soon to contract from
 the repetition of the stimulus, th[deletion]u[/deletion]is explains the phenom.
 of habit - [deletion]from the[/deletion] 2[superscript]d[/superscript] & 3[superscript]d[/superscript] we obtain the 4[superscript]th[/superscript] -
4[superscript]th[/superscript]. The effect produc'd on any fibre, by any stimulus
is a ratio compounded of the degree of irritability of the
fibre & the force of the stimulus directly & the habit of
the fibre inversely. thus let the force of the stimulus
= b, the irritability of the fibre = c & the habit of
the fibre = d. then will x or the effect produced on
the fibre be - x = bc/d but d or the habit of the
fibre is included under c or its irritability therfore x = bc.
5[superscript]th[/superscript] The irritable fibre from the moment of its existence
to that of its disolution is in a state of action -
it is constantly surrounded by a body which acts
upon it and upon which it reacts. The existence
 of the irritable fibre [underline]then[/underline] consists in action -
6 When any stimulus is applied to any irritable
fibre, all the fibres of the system are susceptible of
that stimulus, that is all the fibres communicate Irritability

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00020|dnp13e018pp|61582483[/page]
There are three different states of the irritable fibre
or three different degrees of irritability to which it
is liable.
The first, is the State of health or
 tone of the fibre. -
2 The state of accumulation produc'd
 by the absence of habitual stimuli -
3 The state of exhaustion produc'd
 by the too powerful operation of stimuli -
1[superscript]st[/superscript]. The state of health or the tone of the fibre consists
in a certain quantity of the irritable principle necessary
to its preservation, to maintain this state, the action
of the stimulus must be sufficiently powerful, to carry
of from the fibre the surplus of this irritable principle
which the blood is continually supplying - for this
a certain equilibrium is necessary between the stimuli
applied & the irritability of the fibre or b = c
2[superscript]d[/superscript] When the sum of the stimuli acting upon the fibre
is not sufficient to carry of its surplus of Irritability,
the irritable principle accumulates in the fibre, then
is the irritability in the state of e[deletion]xxxxxx[/deletion]Accumulation
The irritability is augmented & the stimuli produce much
 stronger contractions, than in the state of health. -

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00021|dnp13e019pp|61582484[/page]
19
3[superscript]d[/superscript]. When the sum of the stimuli acting on the fibre
is too great, then is the irritability of the fibre
exhausted, and this exaustion is either temporary
or irreparable, -...-- when temporary after a certain
time it again possesses the contractiless; when irreparable
it ceases to exist & becomes gangrenous. -
The phenomena of sleep, drunkenness, drowsiness after exertion
are explain'd by the last. - Refreshment after sleep, Hunger,
 desire &c, by the 2[superscript]d[/superscript] -
- - - - -
When the irritable fibre has lost its tone, it is either a disease
of accumulation or a disease of exhaustion. When a fibre is diseased
the whole system is diseased by law 6[superscript]th[/superscript]. If the irritability of
a fibre is exhausted by a too powerful stimulus, the irritability
- is restored from the common irritability of the whole system.
If this stimulus is sufficiently powerful to exhaust the irritability
of the whole system, death is the consequence of this exhaustion.
 - When the habitual stimulus of an irritable fibre is taken
away an accumulation of irritability is the consequence
which accumulation is communicated to the whole system.

I thought it would be useless to write
to you before I had something of importance to
communicate - and even now I hardly know of
any thing that will interest you your
love of science & your patronage of experiments
will however I think render intelligence
of any discovery or invention pleasing to
you, as A subscriber to the Pneumatic
Institution I first ought to inform
you of our proceedings on that point

We know as well that certain bodies having their
repulsive powers increased by any chemical or
mechanical motion have the power of increasin,
the repulsive powers of the particles of other bodies
the phenomena of repulsion have been supposed by the
greater part of chemical Philosophers to depend
upon a certain elastic fluid to which the names
of latent heat & Caloric have been given - It
has been supposed, that all bodies have certain
quantities of latent heat upon which their peculiar
states of solidity, fluidity & gasety depend & that
the repulsive power of bodies was nothing more
than the seperation of their particles by this fluid
When a body became more expanded according
to this system Caloric was added to it when
by insinuating itself between the corpuscules
 seperated them & filled up the void space -
When bodies communicated the repulsive power
to other Bodies they become less expanded
The advocates for the matter of Heat that [deletion]xx[/deletion]
this diminution of expansion arises from the
subtraction of part of their Caloric – However
adequate may be this theory to explain the [unclear]phenomenon[/unclear]
We must not admit it without proof - For that
theory which admits not of Calorie is equaly
adequate to the explanation of the phenomena
Exp[superscript]t[/superscript] then is the test to which we ought to
submit the both theories & if we can prove
{41} 

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11305-000-00050|dnp13e044pp|61582507[/page]
The particles of bodies attract each other
All bodies are endowed with the power of attraction
& all bodies with which we are acquainted appear
capable of existing in three forms the solid fluid
& gaseous in each of these forms, the particles
of matter are still attractive; but the attraction
is proportionately weaker as the body becomes
more expanded, all bodies with which [underline]we[/underline] are
acquainted can be made to fill up less space than
before consequently their particles are not in actual
contact - For since matter is [unclear]impenetrable[/unclear] if
the particles of steam were in actual contact they
coud never approach nearer to each other
[deletion]Nor coud[/deletion] they [deletion]ever[/deletion] [insertion]consequently could not[/insertion] pile up less space than before
There must then consequently as well as a
attractive power exist a repulsive power by 
which power the particles of bodies are prevented
from being in actual contact - We find that bodies
are expanded; We find that bodies are expanded
when their particles are caused to vibrate
[unclear]or[/unclear] move by the impression of an external force
 in by friction & percussion, We find likewise
that they are expanded when [deletion]xx[/deletion] their bodies
which have a greater quantity of the repulsive
power are brought in contact with them
We consequently know that a peculiar kind of
motion is capable of adding to bodies repulsive
power or of diminishing the attractive power -

My Brothers,
Life is only estimable

considerable portion of both our happiness
& misery depends on our mutual [unclear]relattion[/unclear]
The laws of our existence order us in our
connexions with society to search for our
individual pleasure, & our private pleasure
is wisely connected with that of our fellow
creatures, Thus man is impelled to be a social
being, is impelled to promote the happiness
of his fellow creatures on account of its
connexion with this our happiness, He
is obliged to be benevolent, He is

Number of sensations and ideas presented to the mind

These [insertion]sensations &[/insertion] Ideas are from the laws of human existence either

ideas - That faculty of the mind whereby we receive

organic matter, it is governed by laws which are as yet
unknown to us - man has five distinct modes of sensation
and receives [overwritten]throug[/overwritten] [overwrite]in[/overwrite] each of them sensations perfectly distinct
