Essay 1&#xD;<lb/>
Of the immortality &amp; immateriality of the Soul –&#xD;<lb/>
fairly argued under two heads.&#xD;<lb/>
Question 1<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                rend="superscript">st</hi> Does the Soul of man increase in perfection&#xD;<lb/>
during its existence in the body –&#xD;<lb/>
2 Are there any Ideas abstract from body?&#xD;<lb/>
3 Is the soul material or immaterial <unclear xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0">xxxxxxxx</unclear>
            <lb/>
4 Does the Immateriality of the Soul prove&#xD;<lb/>
its Immortality –&#xD;<lb/>
– This is all frivolous –&#xD;<lb/>
Answer to Question 1<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                rend="superscript">st</hi> The soul of Man before its union&#xD;<lb/>
with the body is entirely destitute of Corporeal Ideas&#xD;<lb/>
and has no Perception of any thing but its own intellectual&#xD;<lb/>
faculties. at its first union with the body it makes use&#xD;<lb/>
of its new acquired faculties of Sensation in receiving bodily&#xD;<lb/>
ideas &amp; as it advances in age, so it advances in knowledge&#xD;<lb/>
Now Men think that it is the Soul to whom this Stock of&#xD;<lb/>
Knowledge belongs. &amp; that it will retain it after the dissolution&#xD;<lb/>
of <del xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

            </del> the Body – from hence the Vulgar notion that the happy&#xD;<lb/>
Soul in a future state with Know &amp; converse with those who were&#xD;<lb/>
most dear to it in life. now memory &amp; retention depend&#xD;<lb/>
on the material part of man the brain, this is uncontestibly prov'd&#xD;<lb/>

consequently when the Soul has deserted the body, it will be&#xD;<lb/>
a mere blank in regard to corporeal Ideas – as before&#xD;<lb/>
her union with the body nor will she be more perfect&#xD;<lb/>
as to knowledge. The Soul of a Child is as noble <add xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0">&amp; perfect</add> a substance&#xD;<lb/>
as the Soul of a Philosopher, it perceives as readily &amp;&#xD;<lb/>
distinguishes its first ideas with the same alacrity –&#xD;<lb/>
The only difference is that the one has his mind stord&#xD;<lb/>
with Ideas. &amp; the other as yet has but very few –&#xD;<lb/>

Question 3<hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                rend="superscript">d</hi> Answer to. If the Soul can think&#xD;<lb/>
without corporeal Ideas, consequently it can exist&#xD;<lb/>
without a connexion with Body – it cannot think &#xD;<lb/>
Without Corp: &amp;c.&#xD;<lb/>
This is one great argument for its Immateriality.&#xD;<lb/>
If the Soul was material it woud have no Ideas&#xD;<lb/>
* abstract from matter but we see &amp; find that it&#xD;<lb/>
has many Ideas <add xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0">it has not</add> which have not the least connection&#xD;<lb/>
with matter. If the soul had nothing but corporeal&#xD;<lb/>
Ideas than it might be calld material. – it is then&#xD;<lb/>
material&#xD;<lb/>
But many of its ideas are reflective &amp; consequently&#xD;<lb/>
this springs from its faculty of Reflecting on &#xD;<lb/>
It is immaterial –&#xD;<lb/>
Corporeal ideas. –&#xD;<lb/>
Matter is extensible &amp; Divisible if the Power of&#xD;<lb/>
thinking belong’d to matter it woud be extensible&#xD;<lb/>
We are not certain but what it is&#xD;<lb/>
&amp; divisible as matter. then might one thinking&#xD;<lb/>
Being be divided into many thinking beings.&#xD;<lb/>
But this is a doctrine absurd &amp; contrary to Reason&#xD;<lb/>

            </del>
            <lb/>

            <lb/>
10&#xD;<lb/>
And center that thinking power in one particular&#xD;<lb/>
point. Good does endow a system of matter with&#xD;<lb/>
the power of thinking &amp; places it in one particular&#xD;<lb/>
place. &amp; what is that power of thinking – ?&#xD;<lb/>
Why the immaterial Human Soul –&#xD;<lb/>
Such a noble power as that of thinking, must be&#xD;<lb/>
is no argument &#xD;<lb/>
a self subsistent being. Created &amp; dependant&#xD;<lb/>
only on its Creator –&#xD;<lb/>
Motion for aught we know does belong <add xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0">to matter</add>
            <lb/>
Motion is the act of Volition &amp; does not properly&#xD;<lb/>
belong to Matter yet Matter is capable of Motion&#xD;<lb/>
&amp; why not as well of thinking. Say the Materialists&#xD;<lb/>
Can any one Compare a bare mode of body&#xD;<lb/>
Which itself springs from the Volition of some&#xD;<lb/>
immaterial agent to that immaterial agent&#xD;<lb/>
which give to body the mode of Motion&#xD;<lb/>
Is the Cause like the Effect, or is the Effect prior&#xD;<lb/>
to the Cause. Woud matter move without something&#xD;<lb/>
to put it in motion. Matter cannot move matter&#xD;<lb/>
than that which does move matter must be&#xD;<lb/>
something superior to Matter –&#xD;<lb/>

Proof of its Immortality. Here it is necessary to&#xD;<lb/>

Matter by Reason of its properties is subject to great&#xD;<lb/>
Changes. Matter is extended. Matter is divisible&#xD;<lb/>
Matter in its own Nature is Motionless –&#xD;<lb/>
Now Man is a being Compos’d of this Matter&#xD;<lb/>
animated by an immaterial soul –&#xD;<lb/>
Mind is neither Extended nor Divisible nor has&#xD;<lb/>
it one single property of Matter – how are we certain &#xD;<lb/>
even of this allow the soul to be &#xD;<lb/>
immaterial&#xD;<lb/>
The Existence of the Material part of Man depends&#xD;<lb/>

continual Changing &amp; Dissolution of particles&#xD;<lb/>
Pervents this immortality. –&#xD;<lb/>
But the Soul is a simple immaterial Essence.&#xD;<lb/>
And is incapable of Change or Division –&#xD;<lb/>
Yet we are ignorant&#xD;<lb/>
Of its nature.&#xD;<lb/>
for that wh has no Extension has no Division&#xD;<lb/>
that which has no division has no parts that which has no parts is to be found&#xD;<lb/>

is immortal -&#xD;<lb/>

A Man in a Mania often loses all recollection&#xD;<lb/>

A Summary of Arguments&#xD;<lb/>
1. That the Principle of Perception is similar in all&#xD;<lb/>
organized beings –&#xD;<lb/>
All organized beings from Man down to Marine Anemone&#xD;<lb/>
&amp;c perceive by touch. Seeing, Hearing tasting or&#xD;<lb/>
Smelling the less perfect organized beings such as&#xD;<lb/>
the Zoophytons seem to possess scarcely any&#xD;<lb/>
sense but that of feeling so that it is impossible&#xD;<lb/>
for the Mental Phaenomena to be equally <del xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

            <lb/>
perfect in them as in those animals which&#xD;<lb/>
have the other Senses. Man in His Infant state&#xD;<lb/>
is not at all superior to the Sea Anemone&#xD;<lb/>
in regard to Intellect. therefore if the one has a ψυχη&#xD;<lb/>
the other must have. for this ψυχη is manifest&#xD;<lb/>
in the Child only by Perception &amp; Volition &amp; it&#xD;<lb/>
is likewise Manifested in the Zoophyton by&#xD;<lb/>
Perception &amp; Volition. Therefore The intellect of all&#xD;<lb/>
animals is similar. . if the one has the ψυχη&#xD;<lb/>
the other must have it –&#xD;<lb/>

Minds about the ideas received by the senses. Such are Perception thinking, Doubting willing &amp;c.&#xD;<lb/>
The one sense as external is material so the other as internal is material. Reflection &amp;&#xD;<lb/>

Climat. where the Earth spontaneously produced every&#xD;<lb/>
thing needful to their Subsistence. must undergoe&#xD;<lb/>
a great alteration in their Manners &amp; Character.&#xD;<lb/>
Formerly obliged to labour to preserve their Existence&#xD;<lb/>
their bodies accustomed to to exercise were strong&#xD;<lb/>
&amp; Robust. Idleness was unknown to them for&#xD;<lb/>
their Occupations employed all their time&#xD;<lb/>
Hospitality was revered amongst them because.&#xD;<lb/>
when hunting in the Woods, Distant from&#xD;<lb/>
their own Homes. they mutually entertained&#xD;<lb/>
each other. They were Honest because every Man&#xD;<lb/>
subsisted by his own labour &amp; needed none of the&#xD;<lb/>
Goods of His Neighbor. – In their Native Clime&#xD;<lb/>
The bore the Character of a Brave, rude, honest,&#xD;<lb/>
hospitable &amp; unpolished Nation –&#xD;<lb/>
Now in a warmer Climat where labour is unnecessary,&#xD;<lb/>
&amp; Where the Heat of the Sun forbids Exercise. –&#xD;<lb/>
indolence creeps upon them. Their bodies unaccustomed&#xD;<lb/>
to fatigue, grow feeble &amp; less robust. –&#xD;<lb/>
They become more amorous &amp; polished. &amp; now rather&#xD;<lb/>
than work will steal from their Neigbors –&#xD;<lb/>
Their Character is entirely altered. And now&#xD;<lb/>
They are polished; luxurious &amp; Vicious –&#xD;<lb/>

These it is plain, are formed by his sensations, Affections&#xD;<lb/>
&amp; Wants. Whatever then tends to Influence his Sensations,&#xD;<lb/>
affections &amp; Wants must tend to Influence his Character –&#xD;<lb/>

Physical Causes –&#xD;<lb/>

Similar in their Manners &amp; Character –&#xD;<lb/>
The Error of this Opinion is easily discerned if we only&#xD;<lb/>

similarity of Character indeed in distant provinces&#xD;<lb/>
of the Same Nation where the Same laws &amp; Customs&#xD;<lb/>
prevail the Character is often very different –&#xD;<lb/>
This difference then must be owing to Climat –&#xD;<lb/>
The Manners &amp; Character of Man is formed by his Sensations&#xD;<lb/>
Affections &amp; Wants: But all of these are influenced&#xD;<lb/>

Directing Cause that governs the universe –&#xD;<lb/>
To prove then the Necessity of Religion it will be first of all necessary to&#xD;<lb/>
prove the existence of such a being. Things must have been in their present&#xD;<lb/>
situation either from the Agency of Such a being, or from Chance –&#xD;<lb/>
1 From the Consideration of Final causes there rise a thousand arguments to prove the being of a God.&#xD;<lb/>
2. Then if Matter is naturally inanimate Motionless &amp; Disorganized –&#xD;<lb/>
it wou’d have ever continued so without Some cause to set it in motion&#xD;<lb/>

The World wou’d have been a Universe of Dancing Atoms without regularity&#xD;<lb/>
One or the other of these it must once have been =&#xD;<lb/>
Chance wou’d have had no influence either on One or the other.&#xD;<lb/>
or supposing it had an influence on the last. it cou’d never have&#xD;<lb/>
produced regular systems. formed according to the nicest rules of Geometry.&#xD;<lb/>
it cou’d never have produced organized Systems capable of Thinking. –&#xD;<lb/>
If Chance cou’d not have made the World what it is &amp; as Matter is naturally&#xD;<lb/>
Motionless. it necessarily follows, that there must have been some cause&#xD;<lb/>
which set it in motion. powerful active &amp; intelligent. because it moves&#xD;<lb/>
&amp; directs. A Cause seperate from &amp; more active. than the general mass&#xD;<lb/>

This cause having endowed particular Masses of Matter with particular properties&#xD;<lb/>
having made them active intelligent &amp; powerful &amp; given them means to increase&#xD;<lb/>
their powers &amp; their happiness by many extraordinary benefits &amp; advantages not&#xD;<lb/>
common to being in General. it hence follows that they ought to adore&#xD;<lb/>
