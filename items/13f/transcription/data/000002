If foul eyed pity dwellt within thy breast.
If soft humanity informd thy mind
Then wouldst thou not deprive my soul of rest
My soul to woe and misery resignd
[deletion]Ah[/deletion] Thy cruel heart [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]must be as[/insertion] hard as stone
To leave me thus unpitied and alone.

To leave me thus my 

absence to bemoan

Ah when I think upon the dangrous seas
My heart is fill’d with agony and fear

Lest some [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] wind should sink thee in the deep

Lest some sharp toothed shark thy form should tear
Before my eyes all wet with briny tears
Pass the wan form of sorrows and of fears.
One single hope [unclear]enlivens[/unclear] my anxious soul
The hope that thou wilt [insertion]shortly[/insertion] come again

But at that hope that only hope is gone
[deletion]But if that hope that only hope should fall.[/deletion][deletion]
[/deletion]I am the victim of despair and pain.
