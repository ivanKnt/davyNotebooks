distinguish the difference between his meat & his
[unclear]Phyic[/unclear]. if the Soul of Man is immaterial its powers
can neither be improvd [deletion]nor[/deletion] extended or divided –
Can anyone suppose that the soul retains Corporeal
ideas. if it does, it retains part of the materiality –
of the body. If none of these ideas are retain’d conseq[superscription]ly[/superscription]
it cannot advance in Perfection –
These Observations were written at 16 & half [insertion]years[/insertion] –
What a revolution in my opinions since
that time, now 19 years & 1/2
