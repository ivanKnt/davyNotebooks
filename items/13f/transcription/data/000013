The Soul not only thinks but moves the body –
Consequently it must be something distinct from
& superior to Matter
No Proofs
Ans[superscript]r[/superscript] to Quest[superscript]n[/superscript] 1 The Soul is immaterial,
but is that a Proof of its immortality. His the chief
Proof of its Immortality. Here it is necessary to
consider the Distinction between Matter & Mind –
Matter by Reason of its properties is subject to great
Changes. Matter is extended. Matter is divisible
Matter in its own Nature is Motionless –

Now Man is a being Compos’d of this Matter
animated by an immaterial soul –
Mind is neither Extended nor Divisible nor has
it one single property of Matter – how are we certain 

even of this allow the soul to be 

immaterial
The Existence of the Material part of Man depends
on a just arrangement & close connexion of the
Particles of which He is formd – for if those parts
were always closely connected & properly arrangd
The Material part of Man woud be immortal
