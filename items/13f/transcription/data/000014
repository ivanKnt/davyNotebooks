But the Accidents liable to matter & the
continual Changing & Dissolution of particles
Pervents this immortality. –
But the Soul is a simple immaterial Essence.
And is incapable of Change or Division –

Yet we are ignorant

Of its nature.
for that wh has no Extension has no Division

that which has no division has no parts that which has no parts is to be found
Consequently that which is liable to no change
is immortal -

That which is no where to be found [insertion]no where[/insertion] does no where exist
The Soul then is a created being immortal in
its own Nature. & depends on none but its
Creator for its existence –
Do we not form a much nobler Idea of God
when we consider him [insertion]as[/insertion] the Creator of an
immortal Cogitative being. than as the maker
of a mere System which endures for a while
& then sinks into the Dust from which it
was formd –

Now let us examine the other side of the
Question
