Perhaps If we were to trace the Doctrine of
the Immortality of the Soul to its true origin
We shall find that it was born in Egypt
amongst the Crafty Priests who that they
might make men more subservient to
their ends asserted. that the soul or thinking
Power, were immortal (whereas they might
as well have [insertion]asserted[/insertion] colour or motion to be eternal
after the Dissolution of the bodies to which
they belonged) [deletion]& that tho[/deletion]se who erred
against their God or resisted their
views shoud be punished in a future
state. & vice versa.
This Doctrine was transported by
Pythagoras to Greece
