– On the Credulity of Mortals –
Credulity & prejudice have been the grand obstacles
to the investigation of truth in all ages.
Those Men [insertion]of form [deletion][unclear]xx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] whose soundness of Head & purity
of Heart enabled them to make researches
into those things which Ignorance had instituted
Prejudice continued & Credulity beliveded
were looked on with Horror. [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] stigmatized
with the Names of Infidels & Heretics; persecuted
& even [deletion]suffered Martyrdom[/deletion]. & even sacrificed
at the Altars of the Gods.
Men by an unhappy fatality seem to be
blind to Dictates of Reason & He who might
if He properly employed his faculties [deletion][unclear]woud[/unclear][/deletion]
be a dignified & noble animal in the scale
of Creation, becomes by the errors of opinion
