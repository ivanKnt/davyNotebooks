Men Glory in the Chains which Tyranny has imposed
upon them & prefer Slavery to freedom & absurdity
to truth. Alass how long will the human Mind

Continue in bondage. how long eâ€™er it [insertion]will[/insertion] casts
of the Fetters of Prejudice & exerts its proper

faculties? Till that time Man will be

a despicable Animal. A few in all ages
have risen up & preached those Doctrines which
Reason assents to. but how I shudder when I
read the treatment He experienced.
They were ridiculed reprobated & even slain
in the Cause of truth. Many have suffered
for asserting the roundness of the earth some

for asserting that the sun was fixed & immovable
things of themselves of no consequence unto Man
were Made by Despots articles of faith
