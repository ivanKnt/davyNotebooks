That Hypothesis is much likelier to be false than true which is taken up
at a venture. Eternal & immutable truth is it then that these Hypothetical
Reasoners seek after [deletion]do they think[/deletion] to do they imagigine that thine
abode is in the gaudy & embellished region of imagination
[deletion]no they cannot imagine it; they cannot believe it[/deletion] Then their
[deletion]intention must be to deceive Mankind[/deletion][deletion]
[/deletion][deletion]In all our speculations[/deletion] Truth shou’d be the sole object of
our Researches. She will ultimately tend to the benifit of mankind
She will remain eternal & immutable

[Horizontal rule]
Tho the specious fables of Hypocritical Falshood may endure for
a while tho’ they may for a while mislead the Human [deletion]Mind[/deletion]
naturally attached to gaudy & imbellished Hypothesis. Yet the
Light of truth steady & uniform in its progress & immutable
in its appearance will at length shine forth in spite of all the
difficulties which appear to embarras it. Truth is eternal
Falsehood is transitory. Truth woud exist tho’ Man existed
not Falshood exists in Man. Falshood ultimately tends to the
Misery [deletion]of Man[/deletion] Truth to the Happiness of Man. –
Shall we not then search after such an object shall we
which hide her from our view —
not endeavour to investigate Her & to overthrow the obstacles
[deletion]Those obstacles are [/deletion][deletion]Credulity[/deletion][deletion] & prejudi[/deletion]ce. The Chains by[deletion]
[/deletion]which the human Mind is enfettered are Credulity & prejudice.
[deletion]The progress of Truth & Science have been very much impeded[/deletion]
The Consideration of certain Opinions as Dangerous has
been one of the Chief Obstacles to the Progress of
Truth & Science
Falshood like the Ignis fatuus shining with

a weak tho’ Glaring light [insertion]changing & wavering[/insertion] finally deceives
& bewilders the unhappy Traveller allured
by its brightness. [deletion]Truth[/deletion] The light of truth
steady & uniform in its appearances bright
as the Meridian Sun never fails to Conduct
its follower to the port of Happiness
