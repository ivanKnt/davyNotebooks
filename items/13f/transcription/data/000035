An Essay to prove, that the Thinking
Powers depend on the Organization of the Body. –
The Immortality of the Soul being an established
[deletion]Theory[/deletion] [insertion]Hyp[superscript]s[/superscript][/insertion], is generally beleived in the Christian World;
Tho neither Reason or Revelation produce any
Evidences of its truth; Yet such is the blind Credulity
of the Generality of Mankind, that hating an
Investigation of this Opinion, They do not scruple
to reprobate the Man, who makes any attempts
towards it. –
If every one divesting his Mind of all former prejudices;

wou’d calmly & impartially reason on things;
considering, Their causes, origin, progress &
Effects; The Truth wou’d not have so long
remained inveloped, with the Shades of Darkness
which at present surround it. But alass!
