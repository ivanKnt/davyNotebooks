An Essay On the Ultimate End of Being
Man is a being Subject from the laws of his Constitution to pleasure
and pain. an instinctive Motive [deletion]xx[/deletion] obliges him to fear
& avoid the one & to desire & seek for the Other
This Capacity of seeking after Pleasure & avoiding pain
is not confined to Man but is common to all
organized Beings & is founded in the Natural
Aptitude of Things. We may then Lay it down
as a Grand Proposition that all organized beings
desire Happiness & are averse to Misery
Allowing the Existence of a Supreme Intelligent
Being. We must at the same time suppose that
in forming organized Systems capable of P & P
He must have had some end in View – & this end
proceeding from the Will of a perfectly good [deletion]agent[/deletion]
[deletion]must have been Good[/deletion] (ie [deletion]xx[/deletion] And powerful agent
must have been the best possible – But the best possible
End offering is happiness. The Proposition then is
Reduced to those several Cases.

[Horizontal rule]
Tenet 1st [deletion]Being[/deletion] The Ultimate End of Existence is Happiness
2 Man as an Organized [insertion]active intelligent[/insertion] being coud not Exist without
the Sensations of Pleasure & Pain. –
He coud not Exist without both

[Horizontal rule]
Man is fitted to arrive at & enjoy the greatest
possible degree of Happiness by a proper Use of

His faculties

[Horizontal rule]
This proper Use of His faculties depends
on a right Knowledge of things
