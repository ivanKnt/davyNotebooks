– An Idyl –
Characters. Monobbon & Trevelis.
L G Scene. Night Time
The Solar fire had just sunk in the bosom of the Western Ocean.
The trembling billows agitated by the gentle Zephyrs glowed
with Rosy light: Trevelis hastened to the farthest point
of the Land. Where the last Rocks of Cornwal, elevated to
a Stupendous Height scorn the billows which idly
foam beneath them. No sound, no Voice was heard,
Save where the gentle breeze murmured in the Caverns
– of the Rocks, or the billows lashed the Shore –
Borne to the earth by Excessive fatigue, Despair &
Misery seated in his haggard Countenance.
The unhappy Trevelis standing on a Rock. whose
Black brow oerhung the Waters. with a wild
& confused Voice uttered the following Complaints
The Bowl of my Infelicity is not yet exausted, I have drained
the Cup to the bottom. I have drank the very dregs –
Yet still it is again presented full to my lips & every
foll[superscript]n[/superscript] Draught is bitterer than the last – –
The last the most terrible of all, has overcome all my.
spirits. All Hopes are fled. except the last the most terrible
one, of enjoying peace in the calm & placid arms
of Death. Come then thou are welcome to my embrace.
Thy grim Visage is no longer terrifying to me. Thy
Dart has been blunted & corroded in the waters
of sorrow. O my Kalesa, my, Glory & my Fame
