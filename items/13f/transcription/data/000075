a battle so obstinate so destructive to their sons.
[deletion]The [/deletion][deletion]B[/deletion][deletion]attle was doubtful till the [/deletion][deletion]Eveng[/deletion][deletion] when the[/deletion][deletion]
[/deletion][deletion]sword[/deletion] I was opposed to Tola]. my former Rival.
My Sword was Wetted with the blood of his
Soldiers [insertion]but He dared not engage me[/insertion] I saw rage & pale fear seated in his
Countenance when my Squadron drove him from
the fight. He fled westward & turned the fortune
of the day. Then Ulan gave way, then was the
last shriek of the Son of Allen heard He fell
peerced by the spear of Arthur. [insertion]as the ripe Corn falls beneath the hand of the Reaper[/insertion] Then the bright
Victory with ruddy pinions hovered oer our troops. –
Ulan & the troops of Ama: fed towards Bodmin:
We pursued them as the furious Wolfs glutted with
Slaughter pursue the trembling Sheep. –
The Black Night with her Shield of Ebony defended

them from total Destruction.
The Shades of Darkness surrounded us & we pitched
our Tents in the Fields of Kela; Soon as the
Orient Crepuscle with grey & sober light began to appear
I left Arthur [deletion]loaded with fame & [/deletion][deletion]G[/deletion][deletion]lory[/deletion]. as the
Box tree is [deletion]loaded[/deletion] [insertion]clad[/insertion] with leaves. so was I surrounded
with Fame & Glory. I went on with joy. preparing
to meet my Kalesa. as a Triumphant Conqueror.

Alass. Shortsighted Man. when He expects Felicity –
when He puts forth his faith his hand to pluck.
