On Happiness
An Epistle to Miss –
Let others to more lofty songs aspire
And touch with Harmony the tuneful lyre.
Paint the fair Loves, invoke the Sacred Nine
To fill their Song, with Melody divine
Sing Amorous Maidens & expiring swains
In all the Graces of the lyric strains – ect –

– Scheme of an Ode on the death of Merlin –
The Rose
The winged Daemons of the tempest rose
And clad in frowns obscur’d the rising day.
The western wind his watry pinions waved
And pour’d his foaming torents to the Earth.
Spectres flit along the glade.
All in the sable shoud of Night
Sullen darkness veils the moon.
The spirits of the tempest rise.
And agonizing Nature groans.
Merlin dies –
– Merlin dies –
Hark the Night owl shakes the air
Hear a noise of clattering wings
see borne upon the lightning beam
The fatal Sisters speed along
His thread is spun his life is done
Merlin dies. Merlin dies
Ah behold him where he lies
Groaning on his bed of death
Pale his cheek his watry eye
Beams with lustre now no more
Cold his body cold his heart.
Scarce the streams of life can flow.
