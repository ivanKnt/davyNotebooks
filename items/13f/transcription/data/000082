I have often seen the Rosebud wet with the tears of

Heaven & torn by the Storms of the Night hang

recline his drooping head towards its parent Earth.

His Colours faded & his colors faded & his leaves flushed

by the cutting west Wind. I have beheld the midday Sun

dispel the Vapours of Morn[superscript]g[/superscript] & shine in his meridian

Splendor

The dreary Storm obscured the face of the Morn[superscript]g[/superscript] & Clouds

ushered in the Rising day. the blasting wind blew & nipt

The nipt the blossoms of as fair a rose bud as ever adorned

the day. its leaves were wetted with the tears of Heaven

& torn by the tempest, its drooping head reclined towards

Its Parent Earth its colors were faded –

– But the Midday brightened & the Sun shone forth in

Meridian splendour the gentle [unclear]xxxhip[/unclear] warmed the air &

Nature resumed her wonted tranquillity then

refreshed by the bright Eye of the Sun the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] Rose

shone with new beauties & [unclear]xxx[/unclear] full [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] fills the air

with its fragrance & shines with [unclear]xxxtened[/unclear] beauty.

such is [unclear]my xxxx[/unclear] as fair a Rosebud as ever displayed

as Charms At the Sun. but her morn[superscript]g[/superscript] has been obscured

By the storms of Misfortune & her lively cheek

wetted with the tears of Sorrow. But if the  

Gods respect virtue the prophecy of the Dear
