her [unclear]rising[/unclear] days shall still grow brighter
& the full blown Rose shall be still fairer 

than the budding Rose 

Due howled the storm that / dimd the rising day.
The dusky clouds obscured the opening main
On a fair rosebud tinged with beauties ray – [insertion]sun fair[/insertion] 

The fury of the tempest raged forlorn – [insertion]sun care.[/insertion]
Nipt were its blossoms & its beauties fair
Ah why my Parry do the tears of Woe
Still stream in torrents from thy lovely Eyes
Why do these living fountains ever flow.
Why heaves thy bosom with desponding sighs
Tell me, ah tell me, ever good & fair
Tell me the Source from whence thy sorrows spring
The balm of Friendship shall dispel thy care
Friendship to thee a sweet relief shall bring
For surely all thy numerous woes are mine,
Glitters thine Eye with sad misfortunes tear?
To sadness, greif & melancholy fear. –
Does cheerful mirth thy radiant Eye illume?
Does Gladness in thy blooming features shine?
My Mind is dark no more with Sorrows gloom.
That Gladness & that Mirth are quickly mine. –
Ah why are all these precious gifts of heaven
The tender passions of a feeling breast
Ah why are all these social Virtues given
To agonize beneath afflictions Dark.
Shall the bright Charms of Virtue ever fair
Bloom in thy lovely Mind alas in vain.

Surely they shall avert the pangs of [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] Care
And drive away the gloomy tyrant pain.
