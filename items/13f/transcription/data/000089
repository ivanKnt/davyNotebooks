To suppose that platonic love cannot exist
between the two sexes is to suppose absurd [unclear]ies[/unclear]
when the Minds of both seem to be [deletion]so[/deletion]
[deletion]harmonized[/deletion] [deletion]in Unison[/deletion] in such perfect harmony.

no greater pleasure than that which [insertion]we receive[/insertion] [deletion]results[/deletion]. 
from the [deletion]Satisfaction we receive[/deletion] [insertion]consideration of one[/insertion] on being the
objects of the love & affection of one
