– The Influence of Climat on National Manners & Character –
A Peculiarity of Manners & Character distinguishes every Nation.
And tho’ many Individuals may entirely differ from these general
Characteristics, yet the Inhabitants of every Climat taken collectively
are tinged with a peculiar Set of Manners & distinguished from
other Nations by some general Character. –
The Pride of the Englishman & the Levity of the French are alike
proverbial; tho’ there are many humble Characters in England;
as well as serious men in France. –
There are two kinds of Causes which may be supposed to influence
the Genius & Manners of Nations, ie Moral & Natural ones.
* by Moral Causes may be understood. the Nature of the political
& Ecclesiastical Government. the Modes of Education. The
Wants of the People & its Relation towards other states.
by Natural Ones. the Nature of the Climat. the Qualities of the
Atmosphere &c. –

At present we shall confine our attention to the Consideration of Natural
causes. whose Influence on the Human mind may be inferred
from the following Reasons –
1st. The Character of every Individual is a Collection of his Qualities
which are his Virtues, [deletion]his[/deletion] Vices, [deletion]his[/deletion] Manners, Customs &c –
These it is plain, are formed by his sensations, Affections
& Wants. Whatever then tends to Influence his Sensations,
affections & Wants must tend to Influence his Character –
But these are Materially influenced by Physical Causes –
Therefore his Manners & Character are influenced by
Physical Causes –
