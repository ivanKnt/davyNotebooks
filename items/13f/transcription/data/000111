* Was it not [deletion]liberal[/deletion] Science which laid the
foundations for Ecclesiastical Liberty in
Europe: & [deletion]which opened the Eyes of all Europe[/deletion]
The learning of Luther & the Zeal of Calvin
had little availed if Men had not been
more enligtened in the Age in which
they appeared than in the preceding one,
Solon [insertion]& the Philosophers[/insertion] importing Knowledge into it thens
gave her Liberty – In proportion as
Knowledge has declined in every state
so have Tyranny & Despotism flourished.

Life is a succession of Ideas exciting Passions in the Mind & causing action

in Proportion as they are accompanied with Pleasure or Pain.
