Examining the particular Nations [deletion]of Europ[/deletion]e. We find that
the English [deletion]who[/deletion] [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]under[/unclear][/insertion] situated in a Climat where the
Weather eternally varies. is constantly receiving new
Sensations, [deletion]He[/deletion] is agitated like the Atmosphere in
which He exists. His Mind is almost Constantly
active, Torpor & lassitude of the Mental Faculties are
to him rarely Known. He is brave proud Honest
& hospitable. –
The Inhabitants of France seated in a mild & temperate
Climat where Nature almost constantly smiles
are of a gay [deletion]& even[/deletion] temper. their Sensibility is
matured by the mildness of the Climat. They are
polished easy light & luxurious –
The air of Italy is pure & Climat warm. The Inhabitants
are Ingenious, subtle & Cowardly –
[deletion]The [/deletion][deletion]Climat[/deletion] The Inhabitants of Spain [deletion]nearer the Sun[/deletion] [insertion]seated  [insertion]under a[/insertion] warmer [insertion]sky[/insertion] Climat.[/insertion] 
are hot, fiery & revengeful. Amorous & inconstant
The [misc_285]moors[/misc_285] still nearer the Sun are proud [insertion]jealous[/insertion] inhospitable
& ferocious. The farther we diverge from the temperate
Zones towards the South, the more are [insertion]the[/insertion] Noble Faculties
of Man cramped or destroyed. In Egypt life is

rather passive than active, nine Months in the
Year the body is oppressed by heat & the Soul in
a state of Apathy. The Egyptian far from being
tormented by a restless curiosity, sighs after calm
tranquillity. Repose to him is Enjoyment.
Effeminate Indolence is his darling passion
& The Sofa of course the most luxurious piece
