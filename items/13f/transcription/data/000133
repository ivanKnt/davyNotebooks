The Climat of Caffreria.. The Season’s are only two viz

the Wet & the dry. in the Wet heavy Rains
thick fogs & unhealthy north E W. In the dry
Excessive Heat –
Effeminancy & Indolence are peculiar to
the Egyptians. The Turks upon emigrating into
Egypt. who are naturally of a Serious & Phlegmatic
temper naturally lose their gravity & tho’ they
are brave & martial. Their Children become
cowardly like the other Egyptians. This Degeneracy
makes the Men of Quality glad to mix with
foreigners, for Men as well as Animals decline
in Egypt. The Horses lose their Speed & Lions
their Strength & Courage & the birds are inferiour
to those of other Countries
The Climat of Egypt is hot & sultry when the sun
is near the Meridian yet the Nights are
cold owing to the great quantity of Nitre 

with which the air is impregnated
