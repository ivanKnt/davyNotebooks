Theology.
All Religion arises from a belief in a Supreme being. The Maker of & the
Directing Cause that governs the universe –
To prove then the Necessity of Religion it will be first of all necessary to
prove the existence of such a being. Things must have been in their present
situation either from the Agency of Such a being, or from Chance –

it wou’d have ever continued so without Some cause to set it in motion
3 Or if every part of Matter had been naturally inclined to Motion
The World wou’d have been a Universe of Dancing Atoms without regularity
One or the other of these it must once have been =

Chance wou’d have had no influence either on One or the other.
or supposing it had an influence on the last. it cou’d never have
produced regular systems. formed according to the nicest rules of Geometry.
it cou’d never have produced organized Systems capable of Thinking. –

If Chance cou’d not have made the World what it is & as Matter is naturally
Motionless. it necessarily follows, that there must have been some cause
which set it in motion. powerful active & intelligent. because it moves
& directs. A Cause seperate from & more active. than the general mass
of Matter it [deletion]xxxxx[/deletion] –
This cause having endowed particular Masses of Matter with particular properties
having made them active intelligent & powerful & given them means to increase
their powers & their happiness by many extraordinary benefits & advantages not
common to being in General. it hence follows that they ought to adore
& be thankful to him for those properties. which is the foundation of natural
religion –
