            All Religion arises from a belief in a <span id="ttag272" data-info="misc_511" class="term">

                  Supreme being

            Directing Cause that governs the universe –&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            To prove then the Necessity of Religion it will be first of all necessary to&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            prove the existence of such a being. Things must have been in their present&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            situation either from the Agency of Such a being, or from Chance –&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            1 From the Consideration of Final causes there rise a thousand arguments to prove
            the being of a God.&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            2. Then if Matter is naturally inanimate Motionless &amp; Disorganized –&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            it wou’d have ever continued so without Some cause to set it in motion&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            3 Or if every part of Matter had been naturally inclined to Motion&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            The World wou’d have been a Universe of Dancing Atoms without regularity&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            One or the other of these it must once have been =&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            Chance wou’d have had no influence either on One or the other.&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            or supposing it had an influence on the last. it cou’d never have&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            produced regular systems. formed according to the nicest rules of Geometry.&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            it cou’d never have produced organized Systems capable of Thinking. –&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            If Chance cou’d not have made the World what it is &amp; as Matter is naturally&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            Motionless. it necessarily follows, that there must have been some cause&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            which set it in motion. powerful active &amp; intelligent. because it moves&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            &amp; directs. A Cause seperate from &amp; more active. than the general mass&#xD;<br xml:id="">

            This cause having endowed particular Masses of Matter with particular properties&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            having made them active intelligent &amp; powerful &amp; given them means to increase&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            their powers &amp; their happiness by many extraordinary benefits &amp; advantages not&#xD;<br xml:id="">
