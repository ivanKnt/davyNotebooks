If foul eyed pity dwellt within thy breast.
If soft humanity informd thy mind
Then wouldst thou not deprive my soul of rest
My soul to woe and misery resignd
[deletion]Ah[/deletion] Thy cruel heart [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]must be as[/insertion] hard as stone
To leave me thus unpitied and alone.
To leave me thus my 
absence to bemoan
Ah when I think upon the dangrous seas
My heart is fill’d with agony and fear
Lest some [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] wind should sink thee in the deep
Lest some sharp toothed shark thy form should tear
Before my eyes all wet with briny tears
Pass the wan form of sorrows and of fears.
One single hope [unclear]enlivens[/unclear] my anxious soul
The hope that thou wilt [insertion]shortly[/insertion] come again
But all that hope that only hope is gone
[deletion]But if that hope that only hope should fall.[/deletion]
I am the victim of despair and pain.

Essays. –
Essay 1
Of the immortality & immateriality of the Soul –
fairly argued under two heads.
Question 1[superscript]st[/superscript] Does the Soul of man increase in perfection
during its existence in the body –
2 Are there any Ideas abstract from body?
3 Is the soul material or immaterial [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear]
4 Does the Immateriality of the Soul prove
its Immortality –
– This is all frivolous –
Answer to Question 1[superscript]st[/superscript] The soul of Man before its union
with the body is entirely destitute of Corporeal Ideas
and has no Perception of any thing but its own intellectual
faculties. at its first union with the body it makes use
of its new acquired faculties of Sensation in receiving bodily
ideas & as it advances in age, so it advances in knowledge
Now Men think that it is the Soul to whom this Stock of
Knowledge belongs. & that it will retain it after the dissolution
of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the Body – from hence the Vulgar notion that the happy
Soul in a future state with Know & converse with those who were
most dear to it in life. now memory & retention depend
on the material part of man the brain, this is uncontestibly prov'd

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00008|000008|000008[/page]
6
consequently when the Soul has deserted the body, it will be
a mere blank in regard to corporeal Ideas – as before
her union with the body nor will she be more perfect
as to knowledge. The Soul of a Child is as noble [insertion]& perfect[/insertion] a substance
as the Soul of a Philosopher, it perceives as readily &
distinguishes its first ideas with the same alacrity –
The only difference is that the one has his mind stord
with Ideas. & the other as yet has but very few –
[Horizontal rule]
A Child cannot form a judgement of things of which it
is ignorant; but those things with which it
is perfectly accquainted it will judge as justly & reason
as rightly as the wisest sage – does He not as well
distinguish the difference between his meat & his
[unclear]Phyic[/unclear]. if the Soul of Man is immaterial its powers
can neither be improvd [deletion]nor[/deletion] extended or divided –
Can anyone suppose that the soul retains Corporeal
ideas. if it does, it retains part of the materiality –
of the body. If none of these ideas are retain’d conseq[superscript]ly[/superscript]
it cannot advance in Perfection –
These Observations were written at 16 & half [insertion]years[/insertion] –
What a revolution in my opinions since
that time, now 19 years & 1/2

Ques[superscript]n[/superscript] 2: Ans[superscript]r[/superscript] to – Then what is the human soul?
[deletion]xxxxx xxx xxxx xxx[/deletion] I wou’d define to be
the Power of thinking & volition. But will the Soul think
when it is void of Corporeal Ideas? It will most certainly
think for when it ceases to think it ceases to exist –
If the Soul exists after [deletion]death[/deletion] [insertion]thought[/insertion] it is necessary to its existence
Now there must either be innate ideas abstracted
from matter in the Soul or the Soul must cease to
exist. every being that thinks must have some
Subject to employ its thoughts. (There is no proof of innate
Ideas. Man is certain of no Ideas but those which He receives
thro the Medium of his senses.
Reflective or spiritual Ideas are innate & Implanted
in the Soul from the first moment of her Existence
for she receives them from reflecting on her own faculties
* None will deny the innate existence of power thought
These woud not exist without refference to Body
Volition & Consciousness. The soul must think & be
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] for [unclear]making[/unclear][/deletion] & no argument
conscious that she exists as soon as she is created –
To illustrate this We will suppose a man deficient
of every sense except the senses of tasting & feeling.
This man woud form a language of his own. He
cou’d give names to the ideas of Rough & Smooth Sweet
& bitter &c. of Colours, Smells, or Sounds, He coud

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00010|000010|000010[/page]

have no Idea. But he woud possess the faculties of the soul
in the same Degree as other Men. He woud be sensible
This is from sensation
that He thought & that He existed. He [insertion]coud[/insertion] distinguish
between the power of Willing & the power of thinking
& judge of their difference & He coud reason on
the wonderful formation of his own mind. & I do
Not in the least Question but that He might form
These are all material Ideas
an Idea of Eternity space & Duration. He might
even have some notion of God. & I Question
not but that He coud reason according to this
[deletion][unclear]Syllogism[/unclear][/deletion] I am, I did not create myself;
consequently I was created. & He by whom I was
created must be a more perfect & powerful
being than myself. We may even form relative
& abstracted Ideas without regard to matter
The relation between Creature & Creator has
no regard to matter. [insertion]it is material[/insertion] & Duration is an abstract
idea form’d by reflection.
This is all false Reasoning
[Horizontal rule]

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00011|000011|000011[/page]

Question 3[superscript]d[/superscript] Answer to. If the Soul can think
without corporeal Ideas, consequently it can exist
without a connexion with Body – it cannot think 
Without Corp: &c.
This is one great argument for its Immateriality.
If the Soul was material it woud have no Ideas
* abstract from matter but we see & find that it
has many Ideas [insertion]it has not[/insertion] which have not the least connection
with matter. If the soul had nothing but corporeal
Ideas than it might be calld material. – it is then
material
But many of its ideas are reflective & consequently
this springs from its faculty of Reflecting on 
It is immaterial –
Corporeal ideas. –
Matter is extensible & Divisible if the Power of
thinking belong’d to matter it woud be extensible
We are not certain but what it is
& divisible as matter. then might one thinking
Being be divided into many thinking beings.
But this is a doctrine absurd & contrary to Reason
[deletion][insertion]that is no argument it is the [unclear]xxxx xxxxx[/unclear][/insertion][/deletion]
But Materialists say, God who is all powerful
can endue a System of Matter with thought

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00012|000012|000012[/page]
10
And center that thinking power in one particular
point. Good does endow a system of matter with
the power of thinking & places it in one particular
place. & what is that power of thinking – ?
Why the immaterial Human Soul –
Such a noble power as that of thinking, must be
is no argument 
a self subsistent being. Created & dependant
only on its Creator –
Motion for aught we know does belong [insertion]to matter[/insertion]
Motion is the act of Volition & does not properly
belong to Matter yet Matter is capable of Motion
& why not as well of thinking. Say the Materialists
Can any one Compare a bare mode of body
Which itself springs from the Volition of some
immaterial agent to that immaterial agent
which give to body the mode of Motion
Is the Cause like the Effect, or is the Effect prior
to the Cause. Woud matter move without something
to put it in motion. Matter cannot move matter
than that which does move matter must be
something superior to Matter –

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00013|000013|000013[/page]
11
The Soul not only thinks but moves the body –
Consequently it must be something distinct from
& superior to Matter
No Proofs
Ans[superscript]r[/superscript] to Quest[superscript]n[/superscript] 1 The Soul is immaterial,
but is that a Proof of its immortality. It is the chief
Proof of its Immortality. Here it is necessary to
consider the Distinction between Matter & Mind –
Matter by Reason of its properties is subject to great
Changes. Matter is extended. Matter is divisible
Matter in its own Nature is Motionless –
Now Man is a being Compos’d of this Matter
animated by an immaterial soul –
Mind is neither Extended nor Divisible nor has
it one single property of Matter – how are we certain 
even of this allow the soul to be 
immaterial
The Existence of the Material part of Man depends
on a just arrangement & close connexion of the
Particles of which He is formd – for if those parts
were always closely connected & properly arrangd
The Material part of Man woud be immortal

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00014|000014|000014[/page]
12
as well as the Immaterial part –
But the Accidents liable to matter & the
continual Changing & Dissolution of particles
Pervents this immortality. –
But the Soul is a simple immaterial Essence.
And is incapable of Change or Division –
Yet we are ignorant
Of its nature.
for that wh has no Extension has no Division
that which has no division has no parts that which has no parts is to be found
Consequently that which is liable to no change
is immortal -
That which is no where to be found [insertion]no where[/insertion] does no where exist
The Soul then is a created being immortal in
its own Nature. & depends on none but its
Creator for its existence –
Do we not form a much nobler Idea of God
when we consider him [insertion]as[/insertion] the Creator of an
immortal Cogitative being. than as the maker
of a mere System which endures for a while
& then sinks into the Dust from which it
was formd –
[Horizontal rule]
Now let us examine the other side of the
Question

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00015|000015|000015[/page]
13
* But woud the soul think of these without sensation –
* It has no ideas but what are collected from the Material
World. & even its punishments & pleasures in a future
state are all material –
The first notion of the Soul was that it was a pure
Invisible being composed of the four elements.
or as some Philosophers supposed of air hence the
word spirit. some supposed it was composed of fire
&c
+ Every part of matter that we can discern
is in constant Motion; neither do we know
that it is naturally motionless. –
I believe that there [unclear]matter[/unclear] may be motionless

This was my former opinion

The are the best arguments that can
be given for its Immortality

The Body organised Matter.
The Immortality of the Soul is an established
Theory & is generally believed in the Christian
World & such is the blind Credulity of the
Generality of Mankind that hating
the investigation of Truth, They do not scruple
to reprobate the Man who makes any attempts
towards it.
Many of our learned divines have attempted to prove
But alass their endeavours have been 
vain & futile
the immateriality of the Soul. Many of our
Philosophers have beleived & attempted to prove it
but all their [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxxx xx[/unclear] vain[/deletion] Attempts have miscarried
Many after long dissertations have sat down
& asserted that it was a truth beyond human
Comprehension & to be proved from the holy
Scriptures alone.
In the Scriptures we find nothing of it except
some few hints in the new Testament which

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00018|000018|000018[/page]
16
are far from amounting to a demonstration –
Now if Writers of the old testament were materialists
And those of the new, immaterialists, & both inspired
Writers. The ballance is equal. & both Sects
may defend their Doctrines from the scriptures
[deletion]But as such proofs on either side must be equivocal[/deletion]
[deletion][deletion]Reason & the light of the nature are the[/deletion] evidences[/deletion]
[deletion]which we ought to follow;[/deletion]
[deletion]Prejudice shoud never lead us to believe Theories[/deletion]
[deletion]Which are absurd & contrary to common Sense.[/deletion]
[deletion]The body is a fine tuned Machine. The nerves[/deletion]
[deletion]are those parts which convey Sensation to the brain [insertion]the place where sensation dwells[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]The Passions depend on the tune of the nervous[/deletion]
[deletion]System. Those whose nerves are finely formed[/deletion]
[deletion]& harmoniously disposed have fine feelings &[/deletion]
[deletion]Passions. This is what we call susceptibility[/deletion]
[deletion]which is often supposed to be an attribute of the[/deletion]
[deletion]Soul. A Man in a Lethargy loses their[/deletion]
[deletion]susceptibility when the Generality of the nerves[/deletion]

If the Soul was distinct from Body
are primarily affected.
its Connexion with body might influence it but coud nevr destroy it
A Man in a Mania often loses all recollection
in an Apoplexy the use of all his senses.
This proves the brain to be the grand stamen
of all the Mental faculties. when the brain is
materialy injured, Stupidity loss of Memory &
Apathy are the Consequences.
as
If Memory, Recollection & aptness to receive impression
or ideas are the faculties of the brain, Sensation
& Susceptibility the attributes of the nerves.
What Powers can we give the Soul?
Is it the bare vivifying Principle which gives [insertion]Perception &[/insertion] volition?
You will answer no. for Snails possess this in
the same degree as Men. then this results
from the Machinism of the body, I beleive
no one ever gave immaterial Souls, to snails.
Sensation they allow is the faculty of the nerves.

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00020|000020|000020[/page]
18
Is a thing then which really exists so hard to be
defined? They universally pretend that it is
the power of thinking, an immaterial simple
essence endowed with modes & faculties. –
Powers never exist abstract from Substance
Powers themselves are modes.
Allow Perception to be a mode of body resulting
from organization. The lowest [deletion]works[/deletion] [insertion]ranks[/insertion] of animate beings
possess it [deletion]in the same degree[/deletion] as man.
Allow Memory to be an attribute of the brain
Reflection depends on memory.
The Power of Thinking is but a Combination
of the other faculties of the Mind, can it
exist abstract from sensation perception
The Soul as liable to no change coud nevr be affected
by bodily
& Memory? Whatever is liable to no change can never receive
Impressions –
There are faculties resulting from organisation
Consequently thinking &c depend on Organisation

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00021|000021|000021[/page]
19
At the time that you deprive Man of these
faculties you deprive him of the power of thinking.
Many Men exist without thinking for hours
when in a sound Sleep –
Where are the powers of thinking Perception
& Recollection, in a swoon. are they annihilated
for a short space & again created anew?
No they are suspended say the immaterialists
An immaterial unchangeable [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
being cannot have any of its powers [deletion]diminished[/deletion] [insertion]diminished[/insertion]
or extended this destroys their Argument.
Many Men have been for hours under Water have
had every faculty of the Mind suspended & almost
all the vital motions at a stop; Yet have [deletion]been[/deletion]
recovered but they coud give no account of
the intermediate state. where was the Soul

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00022|000022|000022[/page]
20
at that Period? no one can a[insertion]n[/insertion]swer it was not.
There was no memory & no perception. & consequently
no thought.
This proves Thinking to be effect of organization
The Immaterialists have maintained an impious
Opinion. that that God one of whose attributes
they assert to be Omnipotence cannot make
Matter think. They judge of his faculties
by their own & think because they are not
capable of organising [deletion]matter[/deletion] & animating [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]
Matter that the supreme being whose [insertion]suppose[/insertion] will
the Elements obey is alike incapable.
Nor do they scruple to call that Man
an Heretic who in the least attempts
to invade their opinions
Man cannot pretend to judge of the
powers of nature.

21
Perhaps If we were to trace the Doctrine of
the Immortality of the Soul to its true origin
We shall find that it was born in Egypt
amongst the Crafty Priests who that they
might make men more subservient to
their ends asserted. that the soul or thinking
Power, were immortal (whereas they might
as well have [insertion]asserted[/insertion] colour or motion to be eternal
after the Dissolution of the bodies to which
they belonged) [deletion]& that tho[/deletion]se who erred
against their God or resisted their
views shoud be punished in a future
state. & vice versa.
This Doctrine was transported by
Pythagoras to Greece

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11306-000-00024|000024|000024[/page]
22
The first Philosophers beleived that the soul
was composed of the several Elements.
some supposed it air others water &c [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
But the Enlightened Moderns knowing that
if they allowed the Soul to be material
their Systems woud be quickly overturned
Asserted its immateriality tho’ at the
same time they asserted its incomprehensibility
[Horizontal rule]
One of the greatest argument for Materialism is
that a Child has no reasoning but performs
all its offices by what they call instinct
namely when the calls of hunger invite it
to eat it seeks no other food except
the Milk of its Mother. & takes the teat
as the beasts indeed it does not at all
differ from them only as being a more helpless
animal –

Credulity & prejudice have been the grand obstacles

Man perhaps first gained the idea of the immateriality

Reasoning abstractedly concerning his ideas. He found

thought there must be in him something which did
produce immaterial beings, which was distinct from
Matter. One may Consider whiteness Yellowness

A Summary of Arguments
1. That the Principle of Perception is similar in all
organized beings –
All organized beings from Man down to Marine Anemone
&c perceive by touch. Seeing, Hearing tasting or
Smelling the less perfect organized beings such as
the Zoophytons seem to possess scarcely any
sense but that of feeling so that it is impossible
for the Mental Phaenomena to be equally [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
perfect in them as in those animals which
have the other Senses. Man in His Infant state
is not at all superior to the Sea Anemone
in regard to Intellect. therefore if the one has a ψυχη
the other must have. for this ψυχη is manifest
in the Child only by Perception & Volition & it
is likewise Manifested in the Zoophyton by
Perception & Volition. Therefore The intellect of all
animals is similar. . if the one has the ψυχη
the other must have it –

An Essay On the Ultimate End of Being
Man is a being Subject from the laws of his Constitution to pleasure
and pain. an instinctive Motive [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] obliges him to fear
& avoid the one & to desire & seek for the Other
This Capacity of seeking after Pleasure & avoiding pain
is not confined to Man but is common to all
organized Beings & is founded in the Natural
Aptitude of Things. We may then Lay it down
as a Grand Proposition that all organized beings
desire Happiness & are averse to Misery

Being. We must at the same time suppose that

succeding on another in rapid succession
[Horizontal rule]
but let us examine the Hypothesis in its most splendid form
in its most defensible form.
Man is a being compounded of two distinct substances
Matter & Mind Matter is extensible & divisible
ergo Mortal Mind is unextended & indivisible ergo
immortal. The Soul is the Agent which directs the
Actions of the body which is passive & acts only
according to the Impulse of the Mind. The body
is the Medium to convey [insertion]the[/insertion] Sensations [insertion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/insertion] the Soul
perceives (the body is dependant on the Soul
for its Animal life) the Soul is independant
of the Body & is capable of thinking & acting

belong to Matter

– On Curiosity –
Curiosity or the love of Novelty is one of the Chief Instigators to action
in the Human Mind
On Happiness or Pleasure
Considered as the Ultimate End of Existence & the
best means of attaining it –
Man is a being subject from the laws of His Organization
to Pleasure & Pain; An Instinctive Motive obliges Him
to fear & avoid the one & to desire & pursue the other
The Government & Right use of this Motive depends on Reason
And Man is happy or Miserable in proportion as He obeys
the Impulse of Reason or Passion
The different Modifications of this Principle (ie the love of P & [unclear]xxx[/unclear])
[deletion]are[/deletion] called Passions [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] are the [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] Instruments by Which the
Machine is set in Motion. Reason is the Regulating principle

Allowing the existence of a Supreme perfectly good &
powerful Agent [insertion]in[/insertion] the [insertion]Creating Organized Systems capable of pleasure & pain[/insertion] [deletion]Author of Existence[/deletion] We must suppose
that He had some End in view & this End proceeding
from the Will of such a being must have been the
the best possible – but the best possible End of Being
is Happiness –
But Man is subject to both pain & Pleasure, He cou’d
not therefore Exist without Both –
For if He had neither of these Sensations He might as
well have never been organized. There being no motives
to Act – He coud never act. for we cannot conceive Action
without Motive –
It is the Nature of Organized beings to perceive

And clad in frowns obscur’d the rising day.

And pour’d his foaming torents to the Earth.
Spectres flit along the glade.
All in the sable shoud of Night
Sullen darkness veils the moon.
The spirits of the tempest rise.
And agonizing Nature groans.
Merlin dies –

Hark the Night owl shakes the air
Hear a noise of clattering wings
see borne upon the lightning beam
The fatal Sisters speed along
His thread is spun his life is done
Merlin dies. Merlin dies
Ah behold him where he lies
Groaning on his bed of death
Pale his cheek his watry eye
Beams with lustre now no more
Cold his body cold his heart.
Scarce the streams of life can flow.

– On Friendship an Essay –
Man considered as an Individual possesses few sources of happiness
within himself; almost all our pleasures & pains are derived
from external Objects & our Relations towards other beings
constitute the great bases of our Misery or Felicity. –
Man deprived of the blessings of Society woud have no
remaining Comforts left & like the Solitary Marble pillar
in the midst of the wild desart wou’d deserted of his
Friends be sensible of no pleasure.
Social Attachments & duties are natural to the human Mind
and are the links of the Chain which binds individuals together
There is a peculiar & powerful propensity in human nature
to be affected with the Sentiments & dispositions of others.
There is a [deletion]certain[/deletion] Sympathy between Men. like that in certain
instruments of Music. [deletion]Set[/deletion] [deletion]to[/deletion] [deletion]each[/deletion] other where the vibrations
or sounds excited in one raise similar vibrations & sounds
in the other. The passions of pleasure, or pain, joy or Sorrow
incited in one mind are. by a quick [insertion]natural[/insertion] sympathy
imparted to another. particularly when there is a similarity
in the feelings of the Heart joy vibrating in one is quickly
communicated to the other & we may add that tho joy
thus imparted increases. by being transfused from one heart
into another. yet Grief vibrated to the heart of a Friend
& rebounding from thence in the sympathetic notes of Consolation
dies by small degrees away –
The Human mind is [insertion]in[/insertion] every respect of a very imitative Nature
& all the Social passions are contagious & when the passions
of one Man mix[deletion]es[/deletion] with those of another. they increase
& multiply exceedingly. There is a moving Eloquence
in the human air countenance voice & action wonderfully
expressive of the [insertion]most hidden[/insertion] feelings & [insertion]passions[/insertion] of the Soul which darts them

& there raises similar & correspondent passions –

Sect 1 Chap [unclear]1[/unclear] of Idea & Substance
The first of these faculties [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] conversant about ideas – An idea is the representation
of any object in the Mind. Sensation is the original Source from whence our ideas are
derived. The second is Reflection, which is the perception of the operation of our own
Minds about the ideas received by the senses. Such are Perception thinking, Doubting willing &c.
The one sense as external is material so the other as internal is material. Reflection &
Sensation then are not different but one. Ergo all our ideas spring from Sensation –
The Objects of our ideas are called themes. All themes consist of Entities & non entities.
Being is that which doth really & actually exist & is therefore calld Existence –
Nothing is that which has no Existence in Nature. Every being subsists in & by itself & then
it is a Substance. or it subsists by another & then it a mode or manner of Being –
1 Compound Substance is the only one which we receive by sensation but we infer from
Reasoning that there are simple Substances. such as the Supreme being. or the first principles
or Elements of beings. Substances are 2 divided into homogenous, as pure gold. Heterogenous.

3. We observe the difference in the Manners & Climates of Nations
increase in proportion as the Similarity of the Climat decreases.
We cannot conceive two Climates more Different than those
of England & Egypt. Nor two Nations more Unlike than the
English & the Egyptians. In England the Weather continually
varies from hot to Cold. from Wet to dry.
The Englisman constantly receiving new Sensations is
agitated like the Atmosphere in which He exists.
His Mind is almost constantly active. Torpor & Lassitude
of the Mental Powers are to him rarely known –
He is brave, proud, honest & hospitable. –
In Egypt life is rather passive than active. nine months
in the Year the Body is oppressed by heat. & the Soul in a
State of Apathy. The Egyptian far from being tormented by
a restless curiosity sighs after Calm Tranquillity.
Repose to him is enjoyment & the sofa of Course the most
luxurious piece of furniture in his Apartment. –
Constantly feeling the same Heat & the Same Sensation
Two thirds of the year He is idle patient & Grave. –
The European pleasures & Occupations are totally unknown

A Monotony which woud be Death to the European is the
greatest Felicity of the Egyptian. –
Nor is it to be supposed that Turkish Despotism has destroyed
the Energies of the Mind in Egypt. & that it is from moral
Causes that the English are so much superior to the

The same Comparison might have been drawn between
France (before the Revolution) & Egypt.

– The Influence of Climat on National Manners & Character –
A Peculiarity of Manners & Character distinguishes every Nation.
And tho’ many Individuals may entirely differ from these general
Characteristics, yet the Inhabitants of every Climat taken collectively
are tinged with a peculiar Set of Manners & distinguished from
other Nations by some general Character. –
The Pride of the Englishman & the Levity of the French are alike
proverbial; tho’ there are many humble Characters in England;
as well as serious men in France. –
There are two kinds of Causes which may be supposed to influence
the Genius & Manners of Nations, ie Moral & Natural ones.
* by Moral Causes may be understood. the Nature of the political
& Ecclesiastical Government. the Modes of Education. The
Wants of the People & its Relation towards other states.
by Natural Ones. the Nature of the Climat. the Qualities of the
Atmosphere &c. –
* [deletion]Some philosophers have attempted to account for all National[/deletion]

[deletion]must be acknowledged must be acknowledged by every[/deletion]
[deletion]one acquainted with ancient & modern History.[/deletion]
At present we shall confine our attention to the Consideration of Natural
causes. whose Influence on the Human mind may be inferred
from the following Reasons –
1[superscript]st[/superscript]. The Character of every Individual is a Collection of his Qualities
which are his Virtues, [deletion]his[/deletion] Vices, [deletion]his[/deletion] Manners, Customs &c –
These it is plain, are formed by his sensations, Affections
& Wants. Whatever then tends to Influence his Sensations,
affections & Wants must tend to Influence his Character –
But these are Materially influenced by Physical Causes –
Therefore his Manners & Character are influenced by
Physical Causes –

Indeed Warmth seems essential to Genius, cold to Labour.
The Science were born In Assia & Egypt Climats where
Labour was almost unnecessary. The Mind of Men ever

are found to be very different in their Manners & Character
But this difference is more distinguishable in People of
different & Remote Countries. The Influence of Religious
& Political Establisments & Codes of Education upon the
manners of Nations are suffciently known indeed to take
a view of Ancient & modern Greece & Rome – is almost to
demonstate the truth of this Opinion –

where their only means of Subsistence were procured
by labour or the Chace into a mild & more

have occasioned some Philosophers to suppose
that there was no other difference & that any
two Nations under Climats totally diffent if
educated [insertion]& governed[/insertion] in the Same Manner & wou’d be exactly

The Error of this Opinion is easily discerned if we only
take a view of the various nations of the Earth –
We shall find that similarity of [deletion]Codes[/deletion] of Codes of
Education Religion & politics do not always constitute
similarity of Character indeed in distant provinces
of the Same Nation where the Same laws & Customs
prevail the Character is often very different –
This difference then must be owing to Climat –
The Manners & Character of Man is formed by his Sensations
Affections & Wants: But all of these are influenced
by the Climat & of course his Manners & Character
are influenced by the Climat –

Theology.
All Religion arises from a belief in a Supreme being. The Maker of & the
Directing Cause that governs the universe –
To prove then the Necessity of Religion it will be first of all necessary to
prove the existence of such a being. Things must have been in their present
situation either from the Agency of Such a being, or from Chance –
1 From the Consideration of Final causes there rise a thousand arguments to prove the being of a God.
2. Then if Matter is naturally inanimate Motionless & Disorganized –
it wou’d have ever continued so without Some cause to set it in motion
3 Or if every part of Matter had been naturally inclined to Motion
The World wou’d have been a Universe of Dancing Atoms without regularity
One or the other of these it must once have been =
Chance wou’d have had no influence either on One or the other.
or supposing it had an influence on the last. it cou’d never have
produced regular systems. formed according to the nicest rules of Geometry.
it cou’d never have produced organized Systems capable of Thinking. –
If Chance cou’d not have made the World what it is & as Matter is naturally
Motionless. it necessarily follows, that there must have been some cause
which set it in motion. powerful active & intelligent. because it moves
& directs. A Cause seperate from & more active. than the general mass
of Matter it [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] –
This cause having endowed particular Masses of Matter with particular properties
having made them active intelligent & powerful & given them means to increase
their powers & their happiness by many extraordinary benefits & advantages not
common to being in General. it hence follows that they ought to adore
& be thankful to him for those properties. which is the foundation of natural
religion –
