Pretty sure images 25 & 26 shouldn't be in that order...
Image 25 - labelled p153, doesn't correspond to trans. p25; wrong image order?

Image 26 - blank, doesn't correspond to trans. p26, wrong image order?
Guessing 25+26 belong before Image 153

    dnp110 appears to not correspond to images, removed
