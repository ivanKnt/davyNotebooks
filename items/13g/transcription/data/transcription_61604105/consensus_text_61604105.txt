To A.B- [underline]2 years old[/underline] 1803
1
Sweet blossom of the early spring of life
Thy simple lineaments in hope I view
And as I think on thy maturer age
I form a lovely dream & wish it true
2.
I see those eyes which now in passive gaze
Are filled with softness & unchanging light,
Kindling with sacred [unclear]illusions[/unclear] varied hues
And in Expressions nature lightnings bright
3
I see thy cheeks now tinted like the clouds
Which in the watered vale in Morning lie
Brightened with roseate tints of happy health
And glowing like the Autumn's evening sky
4
I see those locks which now have scarcely reached
Thy Forehead's smoothness or thy neck of snow
In darkest shades of beauty's contrast clad
In swelling ringlets o'er thy shoulders flow
