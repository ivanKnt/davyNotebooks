Her music never more
Shall glad my troubled soul
No more shall she create
The world for which I lived
[deletion]x[/deletion] 5
Alone she filled the mind
A vision of delight
In which all natural charms
Of motion colour form
Were kindled into life
By Fancy, reason, taste.

There last I heard her tones
There still the moon beam shines
There still the torrent roars
There still the humid rocks
Flame with the silver light
There still the lofty hills
Darken the azure sky.

Nature has not changed
But pleasure [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]dwells[/insertion] no more
Within her ancient haunts
A star of joy is set
Which never more can rise
No second spring of life
Awaits our mortal years.-
