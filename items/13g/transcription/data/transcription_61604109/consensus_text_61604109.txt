There last I heard her tones;
Her sweet & silver voice
The Mountains rose above
The torrent foamed beneath
Whitening the moss grown rocks
The air was still & clear
The moonbeam in the sky.

She did not say she loved
Yet from her glowing cheek
And from her humid eye
And from her trembling hand
And from her throbbing heart
I learnt the rapturous truth.
3
The breathings of her soul
Were sentiment & life
And every glowing thought
Had all the power of youth
It seemed as if a Mind
Like Hers could never die
Immortal in its strength
4
There last I heard her tones
They are for ever gone
