[deletion]Oh thou art[/deletion] Yes you are Natures fairest child
A Flower of spring time rude and wild
Midst nipping blasts and frosts & snow [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion],
In grace in loveliness you rose
No Violet shrinking in the shade
By purple heath and [unclear]cus[/unclear] moss made
Had e'er more native modesty
Than trembles in your down cast eye:
E'en from your birth you did inherit
A quiet, meek, contented spirit
To what can I compare your mind
A water, free from waves or wind;
Reflecting every varying dye
That moves upon the changeful sky
Now dark from thunder clouds, now bright
In purple hues or Golden light.
