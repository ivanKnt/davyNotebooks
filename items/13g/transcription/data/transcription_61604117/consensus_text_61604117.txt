His screams, the mountain torrents sound
The mountains breezes whistling round
The distant murm[deletion]er[/deletion][insertion]urs[/insertion] of the western waves
Compose the music wild and rude
[unclear]Dog[/unclear] your unhaunted [underline]solitude.[/underline] -
Else^ silent as the grave. ~~~~~
The glens that ranged around your feet
In grand confusion seem to meet
As if with all thy parts to harmonize
They that [deletion][unclear]they[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] fountains drink
In kindred wildness sink
As ye in wildness rise. ~~~
