Summers Heath blast; winters snows
Disturb not your supreme repose. ~
nor the mild vivifying breath of spring
Cloathing the lowlands, all in [underline][deletion]green[/deletion][/underline] [insertion]green[/insertion]
Creating round a joyful scene
Aught of change to [unclear]grace:[/unclear] can bring
[unclear]Hot[/unclear] [deletion][unclear]Oer[/unclear][/deletion][insertion] e'en[/insertion] the purple heath expands
Its foliage oer your blanched sands;~
Your Rocks alone the yellow lichen covers
In tints unfading as their own
No shapes of life are known
Save where the Eagle Hovers. ~
