The two highest Mountains
in Donegal
[underline]Mucrish[/underline] and [underline]Arokil[/underline] ye pair
of mighty brethren rising fair
Amidst the summers evening light
Clouds might ye be, so bright your hue
So [deletion]dense[/deletion] [insertion]dense[/insertion] your purple, in the blue
That ushers in the night.
Were ye not motionless: your forms
Unchanged by breezes or by storms
The same from day to day from [deletion][unclear] agge to agg[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]age to age[/insertion]
Unaltered midst the wrecks of time
Scorning in [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion] giant[/insertion] strength sublime
The whirlwinds and the [underline]light[deletion]e[/deletion]nings rage[/underline]
