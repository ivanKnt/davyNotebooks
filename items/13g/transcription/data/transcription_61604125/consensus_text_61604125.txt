There had the Skylark at the break of day
Thrown his wild woodnotes on the fragrant breeze
The Nightingale had tuned his lovelorn lay
While the bright moonbeam trembled through the trees
And oft his peaceful spirit, would have dwelt
Amidst those halls to social converse clear;
The Charm of long remembrance would have felt
Glad in your joy and gloomy in your care.
