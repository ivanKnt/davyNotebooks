 [deletion]Whatever Phidias had designed
[underline]Expressive[/underline] of the being mind,
Came to her fancy like the sound
of mountain torrents murmuring sound
But for the bodies varying form
The insensate marble was as warm
As strong, to fix her beaming eye,
Which alone for energy. ~~~~[/deletion]
