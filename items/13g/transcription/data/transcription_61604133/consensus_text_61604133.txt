[deletion]Where luxury did a form a name
Which all the virtues [underline]might illume[/underline]
Where venus wore minervas plume
Whose warmed by beauties charms the sage
Was youthful in the vale of age
Where woman lovely shone supreme
Above the poets loftiest dream
And to [underline]philosophy, had given[/underline]
Elisium and a mortal heaven.
She yeilded not to gold alone
No to galconda, glittering stones
She loved; whatever could expand
The Soul the beautifull, [underline]the grand,[/underline][/deletion]
