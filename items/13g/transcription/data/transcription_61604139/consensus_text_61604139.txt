[underline]To Athens[/underline]
Oh Athens! Child of elder glory
The first the best renowned in story.
From whom, amidst the births of time
Sprung forth immaculate sublime;
The [underline]Love[/underline] of letters, science glowing
And an holy charm bestowing
On all the natural forms of things,
Giving to the muses, wings
To raise them from the paths of pleasure; -
From orgies in the lydian measure
Amidst dark Cyprian vineyards given...
To the Eternal light of Heaven.
