Its love was wild its friendship free
Its passions changeful as the light
That on an aprils day you see
Changeful and yet ever bright.
Years of pain have passed away
Its former linements are gone
Hope gives it now a gentler ray
Ambition [unclear]rules[/unclear] it not alone.
The forms of Holy truth severe
Are the fair thoughts with which it glows
And if it ever feels a tear
That tear in purest passion flows.
