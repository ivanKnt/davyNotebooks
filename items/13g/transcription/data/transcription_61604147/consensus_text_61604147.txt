To Anna Maria B.
When in lifes first golden morn
I left my stormy native shore
My pathway was without a thorn
With roses it seemed covered o'er.
Ambition thrilled within my brest
My Heart with feverish hope beat high
Hope alone disturbed my rest
Hope only bade me have a sigh. ~
In pride of untried power, my mind
A visionary empire saw.
A world in which it hoped to find
Its own high strength a master law.
