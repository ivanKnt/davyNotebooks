Valuable expt of Du Hamel
pag: 19. Tom 11 -
He lifted up the bark
from a part of a young
tree in the beginning
of Spring & then introduced
& introduced a slip of
tinfoil - he repeated the

operation every 15 days as
long as the Sap in Spring
& Aut[superscript]n[/superscript] permitted - & cut
the tree on the [unclear]1[superscript]st[/superscript][/unclear] of
December - He found the
thickest layer of wood
had been formed early
& that there had been
a succession of layers &
the last Tin foil had
only a very slender coating
indeed
Malpighi supposes Wood to
be formed from the interior
layer of the bark. -
[person]person_020|Grew[/person] though he appears
 [underline]sometimes[/underline] of this opinion
in his work in the additions
to it seems to think
that it is by emanations
of ligneous fibres from
the body of the Bark.

& that in many trees

Duhamel shows very
clearly by decided experiments
that when bark is stripped
either so or so or so
or so & pieces of
Tinfoil put between it &
the leaves

John Rey had certainly
an acute & active mind.
& had He pursued
chemistry could not
have failed in illustrating
it. He attributes weight
not only to air; but
likewise to fire. He
supposes a kind of
mixture of air with
the particles of the
Tin but had not
anticipated Hooke
in his idea of

the Nature of the new

it into oil of turpentine

if it forms potash in
Ether: there may be
a doubt; but if it
is resolved into a
gas & does not
form potash; but forms
a gas producing potash
by combustion then it
is Alkaligen. -

[underline]To Athens[/underline]
Oh Athens! Child of elder glory
The first the best renowned in story.
From whom, amidst the births of time
Sprung forth immaculate sublime;
The [underline]Love[/underline] of letters, science glowing
And an holy charm bistowing
On all the natural forms of things,
Giving to the muses, wings
To raise them from the paths of pleasure; -
From orgies in the lydian measure
Amidst dark Cyprian vineyards given...
To the Eternal light of Heaven.

Fled is its anguish and its joys
Is such as reason may approve
No storming its quietness distroy
Yet it is ever warm with Love.
Its pleasures fate and nature give
And fate and nature will not fly
It hopes in usefulness to live
In dreams of endless bliss to die.

Its love was wild its friendship free
Its passions changeful as the light
That on an aprils day you see
Changeful and yet ever bright.
Years of pain have passed away
Its former linements are gone
Hope gives it now a gentler ray
Ambition [unclear]rules[/unclear] it not alone.
The forms of Holy truth severe
Are the fair thoughts with which it glows
And if it ever feels a tear
That tear in purest passion flows.

To Anna Maria B.
When in lifes first golden morn
I left my stormy native shore
My pathway was without a thorn
With roses it seemed covered o'er.
Ambition thrilled within my brest
My Heart with feverish hope beat high
Hope alone disturbed my rest
Hope only bade me have a sigh. ~
In pride of untried power, my mind
A visionary empire saw.
A world in which it hoped to find
Its own high strength a master law.

yet still in such a busy scene
And such a period passed between
The recollections never die
of our early sympathy,
And in the good that warms my heart
your friendship bears a living part,
With many a thought and feeling twined,
of influence healthy, noble kind,
Virtues from your example caught,
And without laws or precept taught. ~~~~
The proof this tranquil moment gives
How vivid the remembrance lives
For een in Natures forms I see
Some strong memor[insertion]i[/insertion]als of thee.
The autumnal foliage of the wood
The tranquil flowing of the flood
The down with purple heath oer spread
The awful Cliffs gigantic head
The moonbeam in the azure sky
Are blended with thy memory. ~~~~~

To Anna [underline]Maria B.[/underline]
Think not that I forget the days
When first through rough unhaunted ways
We moved along the mountains side
Where Avon meets the severn tide
When in the spring of youthful thought
The Hours of Confidence we caught
And natures Children free and wild
Rejoiced, or grieved, or frowned or smil'd
As wayward fancy chanced to move
Our minds to hope, or fear, or love, -
Since that time of transient pleasure
Eight long years have filled their measure
And scenes and objects grand and new
Have crowded on my dazzled view
Visions of beauty, types of heaven
unasked for kindness freely given
Art ! - Nature, in their noblest dress
The City and the wilderness.
The world in all its varying forms
Contentments Calms, Ambitions Storms. ~~
