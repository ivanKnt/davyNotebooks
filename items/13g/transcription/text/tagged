Whitening the moss grown rocks

Yet from her glowing cheek
And from her humid eye
And from her trembling hand
And from her throbbing heart

Thrown his wild woodnotes on the fragrant breeze
The Nightingale had tuned his lovelorn lay
While the bright moonbeam trembled through the trees
And oft his peaceful spirit, would have dwelt
Amidst those halls to social converse clear;
The Charm of long remembrance would have felt
Glad in your joy and gloomy in your care.

Fled is its anguish and its joys
Is such as reason may approve
No storming its quietness destroy
Yet it is ever warm with Love.
Its pleasures fate and nature give
And fate and nature will not fly
It hopes in usefulness to live
In dreams of endless bliss to die.

Changeful and yet ever bright.
Years of pain have passed away

Hope gives it now a gentler ray
Ambition [unclear]rules[/unclear] it not alone.
The forms of Holy truth severe
Are the fair thoughts with which it glows
And if it ever feels a tear

When in lifes first golden morn
I left my stormy native shore
My pathway was without a thorn
With roses it seemed covered o'er.
Ambition thrilled within my brest
My Heart with feverish hope beat high
Hope alone disturbed my rest
Hope only bade me have a sigh. ~
In pride of untried power, my mind
A visionary empire saw.
A world in which it hoped to find
Its own high strength a master law.

Virtues from your example caught,
And without laws or precept taught. ~~~~

When first through rough unhaunted ways
We moved along the mountains side
Where [place]place_605|avon[/place] meets the [place]place_914|Severn[/place] tide
When in the spring of youthful thought
The Hours of Confidence we caught
And natures children free and wild
Rejoiced, or grieved, or frowned or smil'd
As wayward fancy chanced to move
Our minds to hope, or fear, or love, -
Since that time of transient pleasure
Eight long years have filled their measure
And scenes and objects grand and new
Have crowded on my dazzled view
Visions of beauty, types of heaven
unasked for kindness freely given
Art ! - Nature, in their noblest dress
The City and the wilderness.
The world in all its varying forms
Contentments Calms, Ambitions Storms. ~~
