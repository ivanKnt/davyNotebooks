John Rey had certainly
an acute & active mind.
& had He pursued
chemistry could not
have failed in illustrating
it. He attributes weight
not only to air; but
likewise to fire. He
supposes a kind of
mixture of air with
the particles of the
Tin but had not
anticipated Hooke
in his idea of

Sweet blossom of the early spring of life
Thy simple lineaments in hope I view
And as I think on thy maturer age
I form a lovely dream & wish it true

I see those eyes which now in passive gaze
Are filled with softness & unchanging light,
Kindling with sacred [unclear]illusions[/unclear] varied hues
And in Expressions nature lightnings bright

I see thy cheeks now tinted like the clouds
Which in the watered vale in Morning lie
Brightened with roseate tints of happy health
And glowing like the Autumn's evening sky
4
I see those locks which now have scarcely reached
Thy Forehead's smoothness or thy neck of snow
In darkest shades of beauty's contrast clad
In swelling ringlets o'er thy shoulders flow

Her sweet & silver voice
The Mountains rose above
The torrent foamed beneath
Whitening the moss grown rocks
The air was still & clear
The moonbeam in the sky.

She did not say she loved
Yet from her glowing cheek
And from her humid eye
And from her trembling hand
And from her throbbing heart
I learnt the rapturous truth.

The breathings of her soul
Were sentiment & life
And every glowing thought
Had all the power of youth
It seemed as if a Mind

Immortal in its strength

the Nature of the new

it into oil of turpentine

if it forms potash in
Ether: there may be

is resolved into a
gas & does not
form potash; but forms
a gas producing potash
by combustion then it
is Alkaligen. -

And fate and nature will not fly

When in lifes first golden morn
I left my stormy native shore
My pathway was without a thorn
With roses it seemed covered o'er.
Ambition thrilled within my brest
My Heart with feverish hope beat high
Hope alone disturbed my rest
Hope only bade me have a sigh. ~
In pride of untried power, my mind
A visionary empire saw.
A world in which it hoped to find
Its own high strength a master law.

Think not that I forget the days
When first through rough unhaunted ways
We moved along the mountains side
Where Avon meets the severn tide
When in the spring of youthful thought
The Hours of Confidence we caught
And natures Children free and wild
Rejoiced, or grieved, or frowned or smil'd
As wayward fancy chanced to move
Our minds to hope, or fear, or love, -
Since that time of transient pleasure
Eight long years have filled their measure
And scenes and objects grand and new
Have crowded on my dazzled view
Visions of beauty, types of heaven
unasked for kindness freely given
Art ! - Nature, in their noblest dress
The City and the wilderness.
The world in all its varying forms
Contentments Calms, Ambitions Storms. ~~
