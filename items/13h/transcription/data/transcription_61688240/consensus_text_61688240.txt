No bigot priest had taught her soul
to glow
with holy passion at unmeaning [insertion]words[/insertion]
She loved mankind, her father bade
her feel.
The joys & sorrows of her kindred [insertion]race[/insertion]
He doubting sought for truth
His mind sublime soard like the
Eagle in mid ether
soaring the tempest rolling far
below, The cares the toils
the vices of mankind -
He did not mingle with the
vulgar throng; He did not
think with them
He often said all is [unclear]perception[/unclear]
all that is is thought.
