From hence the glowing muse
Awakes the lyre to rapture sends her voice
Thro unborn ages, with prophetic ear
Hears in the winds that roll the years [insertion]along[/insertion]
The voice of praise
The great Philosophy
[deletion]Warm with thy energy[/deletion]
[deletion]Born on thy [unclear]careless[/unclear] plume above the [unclear]world[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]And its [unclear]vain falling[/unclear] great Philosophy[/deletion]
Sits on thy eagle plume & soars sublime
Towards the radiance of the sun of truth
Casts her long eye
The lightning [unclear]in[/unclear]
By thee awakened [unclear]runs[/unclear] liberty
And with a shout loud as a whirlwind
Calls the world to arms.
[unclear]All[/unclear]
