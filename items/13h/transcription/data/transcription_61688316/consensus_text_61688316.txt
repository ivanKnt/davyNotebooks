The death of Merlin. --
On the bleak blast the [unclear]shriek[/unclear] of death was borne
Oer the dark wave, in the deep caverned rock
 The sea owl screamed. In the loud [insertion]thunder[/insertion] sounding
The mourning [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] voice was heard.
In a dark cave upon the flinty rock
Was mighty Merlin laid
The air was troubled, and the frequent flash
Gleamed thro' the blackened sky.
The awful sound
Of the loud thunder shook the dusky deep.
On the cold and flinty rock
The Master of the spell was laid.
Thro the trembling ivy gleamd
The [unclear]loathe[/unclear] [unclear]blue[/unclear][unclear]light[/unclear] of death.
It shone upon his altered face
It shone upon his dull dark eye
Anguish agonised his frame.
He murmured low the groan of death.
Round his haggard sisters stand
While their red eyes gleam with grief
The death of Merlin.
