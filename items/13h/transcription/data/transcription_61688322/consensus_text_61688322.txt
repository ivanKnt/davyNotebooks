But Man if Happiness is thy [unclear]desire[/unclear] â€“
Wake not the nobler feelings of the soul
Let not philanthropy [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear], or Love
Dwell in your virtuous soul. [unclear]Ah root them [insertion]out[/insertion][/unclear]
They were not made for this rude age
This winter of the world - Such flowers
as these
Bloom in the summers sunshine
Shed thine bloom amidst the sons
of Virtue
