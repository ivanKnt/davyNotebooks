Awakes the lyre to rapture, send his voice
Thro' unborn ages. With prophetic eye
Hears in the winds that roll the years [insertion]along[/insertion]
The voice of praise -- By thee inform'd
The great, the wise philosophers ways
With the long eye of reason the mad [unclear]world[/unclear]
Turns from the passions & their angry [insertion]rage[/insertion]
Scans the ideas, in his soul combines
The great the good the wondrous & the fair
And drinks o the purest pleasure, [insertion]casts his eye[/insertion]
[unclear]Upon[/unclear] the poor, [insertion]the[/insertion] bustling crowd, the flies that [insertion]sport[/insertion]
In the fair sunshine of a summers day
And die in winter, [deletion]Smiles on the maddening[/deletion]
[deletion]Strife of Kings and Heroes great ambitious[/deletion] sons
[deletion]And seeks for happiness within himself[/deletion]
Awake by Thee the Son of Liberty
[insertion]uplifts the sword[/insertion]
To cut the chains of nations with the blood
Of Tyrants & of Slaves to fertilize
The happy earth
[deletion]But whilst I sing I see[/deletion]
 But ah what rapturing visions, hallowed [insertion]dreams[/insertion]
