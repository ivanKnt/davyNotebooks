Steal on my glowing mind, with joy I see
Another age advance with joy I see
The great philosophy upraise her throne
On the head borne of liberty & truth.
Whilst superstition sounds her dying [insertion]groans[/insertion]
I hear the nations shout Mankind
is free.
To where her dagger [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] lies on the ground
& with a tear of purest pity views
 Her dagger stained with Human blood is [insertion]lacd.[/insertion]
The chains of prejudice that bound so long
That noble energetic being [unclear]in air[/unclear]
 Are broke & scattered low beneath [insertion]the feet[/insertion]
Of great Philosophy, Her radiant light
 Shines on his soul, awakens all his [insertion]fires[/insertion]
Restores him to his long lost dignity
Restores him to the image of his sire
