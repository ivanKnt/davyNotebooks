The sons of Freed
When lo I saw [unclear]by[/unclear] brilliant maid advance
in awful majesty sublime she trod
 Heavens lofty radiance shone upon her [insertion]soft[/insertion] brow
Bright bloomed her cheek, with lustre mild
As when the purple beams of evening fall
on the pale bosom of the western sea
Black was Her eye, from whence with [insertion]lustre[/insertion] [unclear]played[/unclear]
Lightnings commanding awe. Her gait [unclear]uniform[/unclear]
And clad in
She raised her voice; She threw her
hand across the tuneful lyre
Waked by her hand, the tuneful lyre was heard
O Man she cried Thou Son of reason hear
