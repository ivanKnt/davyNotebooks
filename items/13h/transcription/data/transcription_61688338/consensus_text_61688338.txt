The Song of Virtue
The ruddy cart was tinged with radiance the
beams fly
Now thro' the [unclear]Azure[/unclear] blue the bright
from thy ful orb with circled radiance [insertion]crown'd[/insertion]
To light the glowing seraphs of the [insertion]skies[/insertion]
That watch the [unclear]slumbering [/unclear]sons
of heaven around
But hark, the haughty Daemon of the deep
[deletion]Now wakening [/deletion]murmurs in old Michaels [unclear]lung[/unclear]
Ye awful rocks, that tower in majesty
Above the bright blue main, your giant [unclear][insertion]sea[/insertion][/unclear]
Beat by the storms of ages stand unmoved
Amidst the wreck of life & change of [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
Those verdant forms that whisper to me
of the mild zephyr; shall but [unclear]cloathe breath[/unclear]
you side
 For a few summers days, sport in the sun [insertion]shine[/insertion]
Drink the ether blue & sip the sea [unclear]dew[/unclear]
Then die before the wintry blast
Yon moon that sheds her radiance
oer the pure azure of the sky & gilds
The whitely foaming waves. Shall
ever light you but
[insertion]skies[/insertion]
[unclear]beams[/unclear] fly
