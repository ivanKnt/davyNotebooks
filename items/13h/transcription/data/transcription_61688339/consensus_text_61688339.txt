- Ode to the Setting Moon -
Celestial mistress of the night
Why fades so fast thy silver light?
Why glides so fast thy silver ray
O'er the blue bosom of the sea
To gild the heavy midnight sleep
Of the dark monsters of the deep.
Bright mistress of the night for forever fair,
Ah. bid thy beams a little longer stay
With Man the son of sorrow and of care
And I will hail thee with my sweetest [insertion]pay[/insertion].
The purple of even plays soft on the [unclear]steap[/unclear]
Whilst the white dashing wave
foams beneath
The soft warbling Zephyr that
scarcely is heard
Upon the [unclear]azure[/unclear] tinged breast [insertion]of the main[/insertion]
The tempest arose, in the ivy crowned cave
 The Daemon of [unclear]ruin[/unclear] was heard
The winds bore them wildly across [insertion]the old wave[/insertion]
[deletion][unclear]Its crest whitely foaming upreared[/unclear][/deletion]
The mariner listened & feared.
