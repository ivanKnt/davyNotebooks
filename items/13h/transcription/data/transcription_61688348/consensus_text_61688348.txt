–The Irish Lady–
All fair was the night and all calm was the air
On Killarney the rays of the moon softly played
The dew sprinkled woods with the moonbeams [insertion]were fair[/insertion]
And the [deletion]soft[/deletion] [insertion]sweet[/insertion] warbling Nightingale sung in the shade
 [deletion]All was still and no movement was heard in the[/deletion] [insertion]wood[/insertion]
 By a soft [deletion]warbling[/deletion] [insertion][unclear] xxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/insertion] streamlet that flowd thro [insertion]the wood[/insertion]
In a shade were the rose & the jasmine [insertion]were wove[/insertion]
Sat Theora the fair with Henry the good
And devoted the sweet smiling hours to love
[underline]To the Moon[/underline]
Celestial mistress of the night
Why fades so fast thy silver light
Why fades so fast thy silver ray
On the blue bosom of the sea
To gild the dreary midnight sleep
Of the black monsters of deep
Ah tis thee a stronger power than thine
Hunts[unclear]thee resisting[/unclear] in thy orb around
Now bids thee in the [unclear]pathless devastating[/unclear] [insertion]crownd[/insertion]
Now gild the plain with spring & [unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear]
Now bids the bright in [unclear]glory reign[/unclear]
On the blue empire of the main
Now bids thy parting [unclear]midnight[/unclear] beam
On the dusky forest gleams
