1.
The western sky with purple bright
Sheds oe'r the [unclear]hills[/unclear] its [unclear]trembling [insertion]parting[/insertion][/unclear] light
[deletion]The rays of evening play[/deletion] in many a lingring ray
[unclear]This radiance[/unclear] trembles on the deep
Where rises rough thy hoary steep
Old Michael from the sea
The radiant hope illumes the scene
Each darkend shade each gloom between
Her brightening radiance throws
She bids the angry passions fall
She whispers comfort to the soul
And drives away our woes
Immortal Mistress of the tuneful lyre
Thou soother of the miseries of Man
At they harmonious the troubling [unclear]cares[/unclear]
The angry passions fly the calmed soul,
Oh for one spark of thy celestial fire
To warm to animate my [unclear]rising[/unclear] lay
[unclear]thing[/unclear] light
