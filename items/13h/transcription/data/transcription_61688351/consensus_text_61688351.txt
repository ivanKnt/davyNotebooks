To S[superscript]t[/superscript] Michaels Mount -
While [unclear]out[/unclear] the [insertion]parting[/insertion] beams of [unclear]coming[/unclear] play
Upon the purple glowing deep
Where Michael from the tranquil sea
Rises rough thy [deletion]rugged[/deletion] [insertion]hoary[/insertion] steep
[deletion]Thy hoary rocks with ivy bound[/deletion]
[deletion]Thy mossy rocks with turrets crownd[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]Affect[/unclear][/deletion] the western light
All tingd with radiance glow
Attend murmuring low with sullen soar
The billows [deletion]billows[/deletion] beat thy shore

Around thy rocks in azure pride
Wanders the silver crested tide
In gently winding waves.
The Zephyr creeps, thy rocks around
Thy rocks with whispering ivy crownd
And murmurs in thy caves
With some of the sweet sounding billows of the

Around thy rocks
Immortal Mistress of the lune
Quick as the radiant solar light,
Dispels the clouds with purple bright
The purple clouds of morn.
