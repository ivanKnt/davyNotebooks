Ah fool I to tear the odrous rose
From the mirth encircled brows
That around his dusky [unclear]tombs[/unclear]
The ever verdant bay may bloom
Let Ambitions sons alone
Bow around the tottering throne
The feeble Children of an [unclear]hour[/unclear]
Fight for fame & wealth & power
Fly at glories splendid rays
And the moth like die amidst a blaze
You shall bow and bow alone
Before delicious beauties throne
You my Children shall expire
In gentle loves attractive fire
Lo Theora treads the green
View her love awakening mien
Bound by thy [unclear]loves and graces fly[/unclear]
[deletion]What charms her [unclear]radiant form adorn[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]From [/unclear] the bright [unclear]white[/unclear] of her eye[/deletion]
[deletion]Expressions liquid lightnings blaze[/deletion]
[deletion]Her cheek is fair[/deletion]
  [deletion]Fair as the dewy lily of the morning rays [unclear]oriel days[/insertion][/deletion] 
Tingd with Auroras bright and purple [insertion]rays[/insertion]
[deletion]And waves in graceful curls her golden hair[/deletion]
 [unclear]Yonder[/unclear] scented groves among
She will listen to your song
She is young & she is gay
She will listen to your lay
