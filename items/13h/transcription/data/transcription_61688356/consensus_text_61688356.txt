The soft, the tender lay shall move
Her yeilding breast to happy love
In yon shade where roses bloom
Where the [unclear][deletion]lily[/deletion][/unclear] breathes perfume
Where the [deletion]myrtle[/deletion] lily [unclear]flowret[/unclear] fair
X Scents the mild ambrosial air
You shall at your ease recline
And sip the soul [unclear]enlivning[/unclear] wine
These the soft tuned silver wire
Shall wake your bosom to desire
The melting and melodious lay
Shall bid the soul disolve away
Till pleasure throbs in every vein
And rises to extatic pain -
Then shall a soothing [unclear]strain[/unclear]
Calm the troubled [deletion]heart[/deletion]soul
 [unclear]And[/unclear] with the falling notes the passions die away
The soul is lulled to rest.
[Horizontal rule]
 All breathing grace and harmony [unclear]she[/unclear] moves
Fair as the Mother of the loves
In [deletion]crisped[/deletion] [insertion]graceful[/insertion] ringlets floats her golden hair
From the bright azure of her eye
Expressions liquid lightnings fly
Her cheek is fair
 Fair as the lilly of the [deletion]morn[/deletion] orient day
Tinged with the mornings bright & purple ray
Morning sheds her silver light
Soft as the [deletion]silver clouds of morning glide[/deletion] [insertion] morning sheds her silver light[/insertion]
calm the dark azure of the starry night
Oer the blue bosom of the [unclear]azure[/unclear] tide
[deletion]So soft the God of Slumbers[/deletion] sheds
His roseate dews around their heads
[insertion]X Where the warbling Zephyr blows
Where the murmuring streamlet flows
