Then Love and Youth and beauty bound
The scented rose my [unclear]parts[/unclear] around
Then to the daughter of desired
The bright ey'd pleasure gave the lyre
She tund the strings
And smiling softer than the [deletion]tranquil[/deletion] [insertion]song[/insertion] sea
When the bright morning blushes on his breast
Rais'd the soul enrapturing lay
I heard her sing
Her song lull'd every care and bade
my bosom rest - then the echoing among
All [deletion]there whilst all[/deletion]the [insertion]xxxx[/insertion] woods [deletion]around[/deletion]
Then she raised her [unclear]softer[/unclear] tender song
Sons of Nature hither haste
The pleasures of existence taste
Listen to my tuneful lay
And your cares shall [unclear]melt[/unclear] away
Quick as fly the wintery snows
When the vernal Zephyr blows
Haste my Children haste to know
All the pleasures I bestow. â€“
 [underline]Let others courting[/underline] Wars alarms
seek the bloody field of arms
With unappalld majestic soul
Bid Bellonas thunders rolls
[deletion][unclear]xxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] From the lightnings of their eye
Let the trembling squadron fly.
Sons of Nature you shall prove
A softer fight the fight of Love
Wars terrific thunders fly
You by wine alone shall die
