50
While you reposing soft are laid
Underneath the myrtles shade
Midst the murky gloom of death
The Sons of Thunder pant for breath.
Let the philosophic sage
His silver tresses white with age
Midst the chilling midnights damp
Waste the solitary lamp
To scan the laws of Nature oer
The paths of science to explore
 [unclear]furled[/unclear]beneath his bold control
The blissful passions fly [deletion]the[/deletion]his soul
You the gentle sons of joy
Softer studies shall employ
He to curb the passion tries
You shall bid them all arise
His wants he wishes to destroy
You shall all your wants enjoy
Let the Counsel virtues meed
Crown his venerable [insertion][unclear]age xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/insertion] head.
The verdant laurel ever grows
Amidst the hoary winters snows
Let the rose the flower of bliss
The soft unwrinkled temples kiss
Nursd by the Zephyrs balmy wing
The odrous rose [unclear]adorns[/unclear] the spring
Let the patriot die to raise
A lasting monument of praise.
furled beneath his bold control
