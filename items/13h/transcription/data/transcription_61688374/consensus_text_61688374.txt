The evening was calm & the purple had died
on the vanishing hills of west
Ode 9th
that the fair [unclear]silent[/unclear] moon beam playd
The Song of Pleasure
[Horizontal rule]
soft on the tide
The Genial influence of the day
Has chas'd the winters cold away
Borne on the Zephyrs
[deletion]The Zephyrs soft and[/deletion] balmy wing
[deletion]Had brought[/deletion] [insertion]soft mild[/insertion] the fair the radiant spring
Her mild reanimating breath
Wakes Nature from the winter death
The roses [deletion]adorn'd[/deletion] [insertion]clad[/insertion] in blooming flowers
Attended by the laughing hours,
And as she lightly trips along
The vernal warblers raise the song
Clad in a thousand radiant [unclear]hues[/unclear]
Around her steps the flowrets rise
Soft smiles the lilly & the rose
Around her fragrant [insertion]balmy[/insertion] odors throws.
The Zephyr breathes the sunbeams [unclear]sleep[/unclear] play
On the blue bosom of the deep sea
[deletion]All Nature[/deletion][insertion]She sweetly[/insertion] smiles within my throbbing
breast
I feel the genial influence of the spring
New raptures steal away my rest
To [deletion]rapture[/deletion][insertion] ecstacy[/insertion] I [deletion]at[/deletion]tune my string -
And crowned with fair and scented flowers
I hasted to the shady grove
I hasted to the roseate bowers
Where pleasure dwells with love
