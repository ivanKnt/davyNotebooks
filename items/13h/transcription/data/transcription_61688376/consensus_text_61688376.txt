And [unclear]jeasolousy[/unclear] tormenting care
Fill'd me with anguish & dispair
Indifference beneath thy reign
I know no care I feel no pain
 To fate and fortune I'm resignd
Easy and free and unconfined
Stella tho' the livelong day,
Thy image drove my peace away
And when the God of slumber shed
His roseate dews around my head
Thy image still my soul possest.
And thrilld with Love my panting breast
My thoughts by day my dreams by night
Were of thy beauties ever bright
And ever thinking upon thee
I thought on nought but slavery
But when now I think on thee
I think on nought but liberty
When far from thee I lovd to rove
In the solitary grove
There of thee I Lovd to dream
Sitting by some babbling stream
