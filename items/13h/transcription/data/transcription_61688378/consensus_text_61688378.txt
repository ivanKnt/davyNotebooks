The liquid warblings of the flood
The tuneful murmurs of the wood
The soft the tender [unclear]perr[insertion]i[/insertion]us[/unclear] tale
Of the lovelorn Nightingale
The land the distant water fall
So melancholy tund my soul.â€“
But now my mind is ever gay
And bright as the unclouded day
No more I joy Mankind to thy
I cultivate Philanthropy
Stella had you been but true
Still my heart had burnt for you
Had you not despised my of flames
My passion had been still the same
But I now have broke my chain
The Loss is thine but mine the gain
And which is greatest time will show
The gain to me or loss to you
You have lost a lover kind
And I have gaind my peace of mind
A Faithful Slave is lost to thee
But I have gain'd my Liberty
