Thou Freedom most divinely fair
Hast heard thy humble suppliants prayer
Thy gifts restore my empassioned breast
To pleasure, Liberty and rest,
My heart no more with passion glows
My bosom beats no more with woes
And Stellas charms divinely fair
To me insipid now appear
Those Eyes that filled my soul with fire
And thrilld my bosom with desire,
The cause of my empassioned lays
Have lost their wonted power to please
That cheek on which the blooming rose
Mix'd with the snowy lilly glows
On which I once with transport gaz'd
By such transcendant Charms amaz'd
Which tore my heart with anxious care
Now to me no more is fair.
The snowy whiteness of her breast
No more deprives my soul of rest,
Its charms in peace I can behold
That cheek on which the blooming rose
