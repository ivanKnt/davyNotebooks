White as the snow to me as cold,
Her touch which thrilling to my soul
Bade my passions rise and fall
Moves my bosom now no more
That the cold marble did before
I once O Stella did rejoice
To hear the [deletion]sweetness[/deletion] [insertion]music[/insertion] of thy voice
Sweet as the concert of the grove
It once attun'd my soul to Love
The Nightingales melodious lays
Were never half so sure to please
But now I just as soon wou'd hear
The Sparrow chirping in my ear.
Love t'Indifference has resigned
The peaceful empire of my mind
And I once more am blest and free
And own no Love but liberty.
Stella fettered in thy chain
I experienced nought but pain
When I saw thy numerous charms
My bosom beat with wild alarms.
