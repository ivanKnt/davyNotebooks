Ode 10th
The Tempest
The Tempest has darken'd the face of the skies
The winds whistle wildly along the waste plain
The [unclear]Freinds[/unclear] of the Whirlwind terrific arise
And mingle the Clouds with the white foaming main
All black is the night & all dark is the shore
Save when the red lightnings the ether divide
Then follows the thunder with loud sounding roar
And murmurs in concert the billowy tide. -

But when the Daemon of the [deletion]storm[/deletion] deep
Howl'd around thy rocky steep
And bade the tempests rise
Bade the white foaming billows roar
And murmuring dark thy rocky shore
And mingle with the skies.

[deletion]How oft in evnings parting gleam[/deletion]
[deletion]Raptur'd in poetic dream[/deletion]
[deletion]I rov'd along thy shore[/deletion]
Ah then my soul was rais'd on high
And felt the glow of ecstacy
With great emotions fill'd
Then joy and terror reign by turns
And now with love the bosom burns
And now by fear is [deletion]thrill'd[/deletion] chill'd
Then terror [unclear]sate[/unclear] with [unclear]frowning brow[/unclear]
And view'd the thundering deep below
