Ode 8th
To Freedom
Immortal daughter of the skies
From whom eternal pleasures rise
From whom superior blessings flow
To us poor mortals here below
Whether by thy drear alarms
Thou bidst the Nations rise in arms,
Whether from thy piercing eye
The lightnings of the battle fly
Or the thunders of thy voice,
Bids the sons of War rejoice.,
Or in softer charms array'd,
You shine a bright and blooming [insertion](maid)[/insertion]
Bid the fields with verdure shine
And plant the joy awakening vine.
Whether you bid the tyrant fly
Or care [insertion]drive[/insertion] the Lovers plaintive sigh.
Thy smiles our care & pain destroy
And bid our bosom glow with joy.
Whether the lightnings of thy eye
Bids the trembling tyrant fly.
