~ Ode. 7[superscript]th[/superscript] ~
An Adieu to Indolence ~
My willing soul seduced too long
Has bent beneath the rosy chain
Has listen'd to the rapturous song
Of Pleasure and her Siren train,
I felt the soft seductive fire
Of Beautys animating charms
To Cythereas wild alarms
I struck the Love awaken'd Lyre
— — — — — — —
Enthe
But lo! The fair Theora moves along
The laughing loves and Graces round [insertion]her move[/insertion]
To her I dedicate my parting song
The plaintive two song shall move her breast [insertion]to love[/insertion]
Her cheek with beautys blushing rose [insertion]is warm[/insertion]
Around her lips the dimpled graces fly:
A bright expression heightens every charm
And beams in lightnings from her azure eye.
