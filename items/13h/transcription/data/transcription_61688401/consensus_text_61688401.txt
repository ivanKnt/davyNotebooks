To those the feeble Children of an hour
Adown the stream of sloth content to glide
To those enamoured by the charms of power
Who on Ambitions lofty whirlwinds ride.
30
To the proud Children of terrific war
By the blood stained hand of vict'ry crown'd
Who like the blazing meteors of the air
Spread death and desolation all around
31
Like the tumultuous billows of the sea
Succeed the Generations of mankind
Some in oblivious silence pass away
And leave no vestige of their lives behind.
32
Others like those proud waves which beat
the shore
A low and momentary murmur raise
But soon their transient glories are no more
No future ages echo with their praise.
