Like yon proud rocks, amidst the sea of time
Superior scorning all the billows rage,
The living Sons of Genius stand sublime,
The Immortal Children of another age.

For those exist, whose pure etherial minds
Imbibing portions of Celestial day
Scorn all terrestrial cares, all mean designs,
As bright ey'd Eagles scorn the Lunar ray. -

Their's is the glory of a lasting name
The meed of genius and her living fires,
The need of genius and her living fires,
Their's is the laurel of eternal fame
And their's the sweetness of the muses lyres.

When the red lightnings thro' the ether fly
And the white foaming billows lash the shores
When to the rattling thunders of the sky
The angry Daemon of the waters roars
