Thus the pale Moon whose pure celestial light
Has chas'd the gloomy clouds of night away;
Rest'o her white cheek with silver radiance bright
On the soft bosom of the western sea.
26
Lost in the glowing wave her radiance dies
Yet e'er her fall she points her lingring ray
To the bright azure of the orient skies
To the fair dawning of the glorious day
27.
Thus fair the joys and thus sublime the aim
Of those whom Genius and her hope inspires
Of those who drink the vivifying stream
Of Inspiration from the muses lyres.
28
They are superior to the vulgar throng
Who never feel the energies of mind
Who pass the varied road of life along,
And then to dull oblivion are resign'd.
