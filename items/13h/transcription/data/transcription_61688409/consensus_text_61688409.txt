For them, the Zephyr fans the odrous dale,
For them, the warbling streamlet softly flows,
For them, the Dryads shade the verdant vale,
To them sweet Philomel attunes her woes,
13
Yet not alone, delight the soft and fair,
Alike the grander scenes of Nature move,
Yet not alone, her beauties claim their care
The great, sublime, and terrible they love
14
The Sons of Nature; they alike delight
In the rough precipices broken steep,
In the black terrors of the stormy night,
And in the thunders of the threatning deep.
15
And when untouchd by Natures living fires,
No [deletion]poets[/deletion] [insertion]native[/insertion] rapture fills the drowsy soul;
Then former ages with their tuneful lyres,
Can bid the fury of the passions fall
16
By the blue tapers melancholy light
Whilst all around the midnight torrents pour
And awful glooms beset the face of night,
They waste the silent solitary hour.
