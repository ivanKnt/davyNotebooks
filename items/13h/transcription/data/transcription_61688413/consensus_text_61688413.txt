Ah then how sweet, to pass the night away
In silent converse with the Grecian page,
Whilst Homer tunes his ever living lay

To scan the wonders of the tuneful art
To feel the muses animating fire
To [deletion]warm[/deletion] to elevate the glowing heart
With all the music of the Theban [insertion]+[/insertion] lyre.

The tranquil reign of mild Philosophy;

Of those who dar'd for Liberty to bleed,
Of those who in the cause of freedom died.
