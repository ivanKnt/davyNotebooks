Ah; who shall calm the troubled soul,
And bid the angry passions fall.
Behold in smiles eternal clad
Rayd in the Radiance of the skies,
To man the meek ey'd Virtue flies,
With Harmony celestial Maid.
At the soft music of her tuneful voice,
The fury passions fly the calmed mind,
She points to heaven and bids the soul rejoice
In hopes of future joys eternal and refin'd. -
Or this 11
What lasting pleasure can remain
Amidst this ever changing scene.
Virtue alone can calm the soul
Her radiant smiles for ever bright,
Dispel misfortunes gloomy night,
And bid the angry passions fall,
She leads the way to yon celestial skies
Where murky tempests never dim the day
Where the great father purest light [unclear]suppl[/unclear]
To pleasures sun which shines with =
