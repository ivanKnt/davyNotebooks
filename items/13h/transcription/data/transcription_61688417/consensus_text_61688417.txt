Before her lucid all enlightning ray,
The pallid spectres of the night retire.
She drives the gloomy terrors far away,
And fills the bosom with celestial fire.

Inspired by her the sons of Genius rise
Above all earthly thoughts, all vulgar cares
Wealth, power and Grandeur they alike despise,
Enraptured by the good, the great, the fair.

A thousand varying joys to them belong,
The charms of Nature and her changeful [insertion]scenes,[/insertion]
Theirs is the music of the vernal song,
And theirs the colors of the vernal plains.

Theirs is the purple tinged ev'nings ray ;
With all the radiance of the morning sky;
Theirs is the splendor of the risen day,
Enshrined in glory by the suns bright eye.

To them, no wakeful Moon beam shines in vain
On the dark bosom of the trackless wood,
Sheds its wild radiance oer the desart plain
Or softly glides along the crystal flood. -
