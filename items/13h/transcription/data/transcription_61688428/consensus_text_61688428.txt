Ye ecstacies ye joys refin'd
Short is your empire oer the mind.
For manhood comes and leads along,
Foresight black with boding cares;
To hopes succedd the pallid fears;
A numerous and a haggard throng.
Despised Love shall tear the weary heart,
And bid the bosom heave with many a sigh.
There Jealousy shall fix his rankling dart,
Misfortunes frequent tears shall wet the =

Then what avails a tuneful tongue,
The Muses lyres are all unstrung.
Lo criticisms baneful breath,
Bids the poets laurels fade:
Envy casts her darksome shade,
Oer Apollos sacred wreath.
Glory when gaind is like the lightnings [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
A flame that scorches its possessors head;
Cold penury is ill supplied by praise;
And what avails the sculptur'd bust =
