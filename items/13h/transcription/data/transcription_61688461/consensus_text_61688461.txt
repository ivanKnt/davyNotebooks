Now thro' the blue celestial air,
Bright Phoebus drives his fiery car.
The azure bosom of the deep,
Reflects the radiance of the day:
Here on the waves the sun beams play,
There on the peaceful calm they sleep.
To the soft murmurings of the southern breeze,
The waves responsive sound the shores along:
The lofty thrush bold warbles thr'o the trees;
The aereal sky lark pours her tuneful song

Watered by the morning dew,
The meadows shine with verdure new.
Humid from the dew drop fair.
With brighter tints the flowrets glow,
With clearer streams the fountains flow,
And purer breezes fan the air.
Thus lovely is the bright ey'd mornings reign
In glory by the lucid sun beams drest
Fair youth and beauty gladden all [unclear]the[/unclear]
And Harmony sleep soft on Natures =
= beauteous breast.
