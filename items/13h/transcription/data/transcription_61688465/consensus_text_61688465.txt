Thus free from pain and care and strife
Shines the radiant morn of life
When youth and fancy paint the view
All fair with hopes resplendent ray
Pure as the radiance of the day
With bright ey'd pleasures ever new.
When the young life upon his purple wings
Transports the youthful charmer gentle Love.
Then Poesy attunes the quivering strings
And trembling first essays her Sapphic lyre to prove.
6.
Self Love directs the glowing fires,
Sublime the mounting soul aspires,
Ambition bids her seek a name:
Ardent the Phantom she pursues:
Enraptured with her kindred muse,
She sighs, she burns for lasting fame.
She sees, raised high on fancys splendid wing,
Her temples glistening with the poets lays;
Enraptured she attunes the vocal string.
To gain from ages yet unborn eternal wreaths of praise.
x Sappho has written of Love in a most beautiful
and passionate Manner. vide the beautiful
fragment preserved in Longinus of the Sublime
- ."Blest as the immortal gods is he.
etc.
