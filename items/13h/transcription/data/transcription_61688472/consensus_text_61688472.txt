Ode 4
- On the Morning -
1[superscript]st[/superscript]
From yon orient azure sky
The gloomy shades of darkness fly
Shining oer the trembling sea,
Phosphor sheds his [deletion]lucid[/deletion] [insertion]pallid[/insertion] light;
Silvered oe'r with radiance bright,
The Zephyr raised billows play.
Pale is the lustre of the lamps of heaven,
Before the morning all their glory flies.
Obliquely from the fount of Titan given,*
A thousand glowing tints and radiant colors rise.

To the twilight pale and grey
Succeeds Auroras purple ray.
Her radiant cheeks are pictured fair
With all the blushes of the spring
To her the fragrant Zephyrs bring
The balmy odors of the air.
Thro' the refulgent portals of the morn
His front the father of the day displays,
Bright floods of light his radiant brows adorn
And the pure orient ether reddens with the blaze.
* Twilight and the Aurora are caused by the refraction of
light. ie the rays of light (in passing from the sun
to the earth) entering the air, are diverted from
their perpendicular course, and refracted or bent
downwards, and consequently appear sooner than
they otherwise woud have done. -
