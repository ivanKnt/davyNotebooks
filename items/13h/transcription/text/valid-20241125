The discovery of the absorbtion of
oxygen gas in respiration &
the dependance of life on this
 absorption formed a new area
in physiological science.
From this time Chemistry which
had been almost exclusively
employed for the purposes of

became connected with life.

But before accurate chemical
investigations had determined the
changes effected in the blood
by this principle of life, theories
were formed referring all
living action to its combination
& decomposition

The number of theories that have been
formed have born a very great
proportion to the number of facts
discovered. –
Another evil has originated from
favorite hypothesis: namely
experiments mutilated and
not to be relied upon.
He who is governed by preconceived
opinions, may be considered
as a person viewing objects

with the composition of our
 agents. –
[Horizontal rule]
The dependance of life upon
the perpetual assimilation of new
principles with the blood. the
necessity of supposing that some change
must take place in the nervous
muscular fibre during sensitive
& irritative action - compounded
with the changes effected in
nutritive matter during its
animation render it probable
that the phaenomena of life
are capable of chemical solution
But this supposition instead of
inducing us to form crude
& hasty theories concerning
the [insertion]specific[/insertion] nature of those changes
& the principles producing
them

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11308-000-00020|dnp13h018pp|61688278[/page]

them.
The immediate changes producing

accurately ascertaining the changes
effected in dead matter during
its animation, that we can
hope to reason concerning the
specific changes in living

these changes with known
analogous ones in dead matter
that we can hope to
make any progress in the
chemistry of life;
But perhaps nothing is more
ridiculous than to reason concerning

- Ode to the Setting Moon -
Celestial mistress of the night
Why fades so fast thy silver light?
Why glides so fast thy silver ray
O'er the blue bosom of the sea
To gild the heavy midnight sleep
Of the dark monsters of the deep.
Bright mistress of the night for forever fair,
Ah. bid thy beams a little longer stay
With Man the son of sorrow and of care
And I will hail thee with my sweetest [insertion]pay[/insertion].

Or the thunders of thy voice,
Bids the sons of War rejoice.,

Adown the stream of sloth content to glide

Who like the blazing meteors of the air

Succeed the Generations of mankind
Some in oblivious silence pass away
And leave no vestige of their lives behind.

A low and momentary murmur raise
But soon their transient glories are no more
No future ages echo with their praise.

Thus the pale Moon whose pure celestial light
Has chas'd the gloomy clouds of night away;
Rest'o her white cheek with silver radiance bright
On the soft bosom of the western sea.

Lost in the glowing wave her radiance dies
Yet e'er her fall she points her lingring ray
To the bright azure of the orient skies
To the fair dawning of the glorious day

Thus fair the joys and thus sublime the aim
Of those whom Genius and her hope inspires
Of those who drink the vivifying stream
Of Inspiration from the muses lyres.

Who never feel the energies of mind
Who pass the varied road of life along,
And then to dull oblivion are resign'd.

For them, the Zephyr fans the odrous dale,
For them, the warbling streamlet softly flows,
For them, the Dryads shade the verdant vale,
To them sweet Philomel attunes her woes,

Alike the grander scenes of Nature move,
Yet not alone, her beauties claim their care
The great, sublime, and terrible they love

In the rough precipices broken steep,
In the black terrors of the stormy night,
And in the thunders of the threatning deep.

Whilst all around the midnight torrents pour

Before her lucid all enlightning ray,
The pallid spectres of the night retire.
She drives the gloomy terrors far away,
And fills the bosom with celestial fire.

Inspired by her the sons of Genius rise
Above all earthly thoughts, all vulgar cares
Wealth, power and Grandeur they alike despise,
Enraptured by the good, the great, the fair.

Thus free from pain and care and strife
Shines the radiant morn of life
When youth and fancy paint the view
All fair with hopes resplendent ray
Pure as the radiance of the day
With bright ey'd pleasures ever new.
When the young life upon his purple wings
Transports the youthful charmer gentle Love.
Then Poesy attunes the quivering strings
And trembling first essays her Sapphic lyre to prove.

Self Love directs the glowing fires,
Sublime the mounting soul aspires,
Ambition bids her seek a name:
Ardent the Phantom she pursues:
Enraptured with her kindred muse,
She sighs, she burns for lasting fame.
She sees, raised high on fancys splendid wing,
Her temples glistening with the poets lays;
Enraptured she attunes the vocal string.
To gain from ages yet unborn eternal wreaths of praise.

Now thro' the blue celestial air,
Bright Phoebus drives his fiery car.
The azure bosom of the deep,
Reflects the radiance of the day:
Here on the waves the sun beams play,
There on the peaceful calm they sleep.

The waves responsive sound the shores along:
The lofty thrush bold warbles thr'o the trees;
The aereal sky lark pours her tuneful song

Ode 4
- On the Morning -
1[superscript]st[/superscript]
From yon orient azure sky
The gloomy shades of darkness fly
Shining oer the trembling sea,
Phosphor sheds his [deletion]lucid[/deletion] [insertion]pallid[/insertion] light;
Silvered oe'r with radiance bright,
The Zephyr raised billows play.
Pale is the lustre of the lamps of heaven,
Before the morning all their glory flies.
Obliquely from the fount of Titan given,*
A thousand glowing tints and radiant colors rise.
2
To the twilight pale and grey
Succeeds Auroras purple ray.
Her radiant cheeks are pictured fair
With all the blushes of the spring
To her the fragrant Zephyrs bring
The balmy odors of the air.
Thro' the refulgent portals of the morn
His front the father of the day displays,
Bright floods of light his radiant brows adorn
And the pure orient ether reddens with the blaze.
* Twilight and the Aurora are caused by the refraction of
light. ie the rays of light (in passing from the sun
to the earth) entering the air, are diverted from
their perpendicular course, and refracted or bent
downwards, and consequently appear sooner than
they otherwise woud have done. -
