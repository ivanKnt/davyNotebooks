Though carved in Adamant, thy honoured name
Lives in the [insertion][unclear]ar[/unclear][/insertion] ark of ages, lives to Fame.
Farewell - thy form shall fancy's eye pursue
With prayers, with vows, with wishes ever true,
And ah! if aught of good or bliss impart,
The benedictions of a faithful Heart,
If sorcery divine or holy spell
In the firm pledge of souls devoted dwell,
When, breathed thy name in consecrated sighs
From bosoms pure, the orisons arise,
Then, thou [underline]thrice blest[/underline] a charmed life shall [insertion]bear![/insertion]
To Earth, to Heaven, to Man, to Demon, dear;
Then shall no Fiend, no harpy dire of pain
Thy threshold blast, thy mansion's peace profane,
Nor care, the beldam care shall haunt thy way,}
Nor on thy breast, her touch unhallowed lay,}
That wan and withering palm, in which all blooms decay:}
