Along thy path, may fruits autumnal spread,
Whilst vernal blossoms, spring beneath thy tread,
Still to thine eye, Life's green ear'd joy expand
While bends the purple vintage to thy hand.-
To thine own sphere, to nature's temple, go
Pause, at her altar pause, with reverence low,
The one great spirit [underline]Truth[/underline], invoke, adore,
And hymns of praise, of holy rapture pour.
For [underline]Thee[/underline], the secret portal open flies,}
Free to thy feet the sanctuary lies,}
And the veil's wavy folds, the mystic folds arise,}
Beloved of Heaven! for Thee, be formed the bower
Of leaves impervious to the solar power,
Where scarce the arrowy beam may glide between
The rude arcade of deepest, densest green,
