Where as in Eden's blissful shade of rest
When Man held converse with an angel guest,
Mayst Thou, enbosomed in thy still retreat,
The blue-eyed cherub contemplation greet.
There muse, intent on Nature's spotless page
To some a blank, but to the inspired sage,
The book of Life, where Love and Wisdom shine
The almighty thought, "creation's type" divine.
Go with truth's wand, the giant shades arrest
That linger on the mountain's sinewy breast,
And mid sepulchral rocks that proudly stand,
The Pyramids unwrought of mortal hand,
Mid ruins sanctified by elder time
When rose the spirit of the floods sublime
