Draw from the dusky ore, the silent stone
The ancient records of a world unknown,
Dash from the sea born base, oblivion's wave
Redeem the chart of ages, from the grave.
Or wilt thou by a purer spirit led
Philanthropy - the grassy woodlands tread,
What time the Lark, harmonious herald! hails
His minstrel brethren of the woods and dales,
When hasting from the dewy tents away
From hill to hill swift flies the golden day,
At living Nature's "rich mysterious shrine"
Detect the unwrought vegetable mine,
With chemic care, the shining furrows trace
And scatter blessings on the human race.
