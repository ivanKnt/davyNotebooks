Yet here - though sweet the scene - forbear to stay
A different region claims thy potent sway -
A new creation, by thy forming will
From chaos called, to thee obedient still,
Where dwells thy voice on beauty's raptured ear
Experience listens, Folly drops her sneer
Ah! not to Sadness, to regret resign
This infant Orb of science, only thine.
For absent Thou - what friendly spirit calls
To this dark roof - these desolated walls,
The vase of science or pierian strain
For [underline]Thee, the Absent[/underline], roams the restless eye}
To thee reverts the ever vagrant sigh}
Unkindled by thy breath the flames of science die!}
