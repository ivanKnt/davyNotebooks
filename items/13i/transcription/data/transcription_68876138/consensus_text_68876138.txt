11
Soul of that World! which at thy word arose
That word which artless as persuasive flows
Slave to no sovereign - to no palace known
The minister of Nature's power alone,
Ah here without or crown or empire reign
The Heart thy throne - the mind thy pure domain
Unsceptred Chief! here reign by Heaven designed
To conquer Folly and to bless Mankind.
Fidelissima
