Oh! were I rich in nature's lore
For [underline]Him[/underline] I would her worlds explore
For Him, with pious avarice sweep
The treasures of the mineral deep
And steal the starry gems that throw
Pale lustre o'er the realms below,
Sweet were each care and soft each toil
If once rewarded with his smile,
And cheaply all could I resign
If but [underline]his[/underline] hand [underline]received[/underline] from mine.
But me, alas! the fates unkind
Within a narrow sphere confined,
