Nor fortune hailed my natal hour
Nor wisdom gave her sacred dower.
Go - simple gift thou humble band
Go, thou unformed by venal hand
Thy destined Lord's acceptance sue
And with thee take this last adieu:
And if a gentle heart he bear
A Heart to gentle spirits dear,
Then shall he to a stranger's prayer
Consent a stranger's pledge to wear,
And, ah, these conscious eyes again
Shall hail the tributary chain
Oh Thou! whose influence oft hath blest
The little world within this breast,
