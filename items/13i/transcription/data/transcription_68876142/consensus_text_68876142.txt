Whose image gilds the pensive hour
Of fancy's vision-weaving power,
Though, nought this gift so simple, boast
And but some sighs the giver cost
Yet oh with smile benignant deign
These links to touch, to wear this chain
And if I (as Fame the unwilling ear
Informs) a softer chain Thou bear,
Then may no darkling shade destroy
The fabric of thy promised joy,
And may all spirits blest and good
Unseen, who haunt or wave or wood
AEthereal nature's sportive train
On Thee "sweet influences rain."
