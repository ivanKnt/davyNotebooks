17
Oh not for him Love's hallowed Urn
The golden light of life shall burn
Oh not for him the aethereal flame
That quivers through the feeling frame;
Inert, dull, earthly is the mould
That bears an iron bosom cold -
Oh yield then to a guiltless prayer,
The simple chain consent to wear
That chain accepted let me view
Then look a long, a sad adieu.
And oft the dewy skies beneath
When all of peace of love shall breathe,
Oft in some cloud that sails serene
Alone in heaven's blue ocean seen,
