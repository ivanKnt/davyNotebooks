Rude Winter! iron sceptred power,
No more I greet thy joyless hour,
[underline]His[/underline] smile no longer gilds thy form
Nor breathes his music, in thy storm;
Rude Winter, I abhor thee now
Thou tyrant of the obdurate brow!
Wild ruin marks thy stern career
Fell spoiler of the aged year. -
This day November's frowns invest
This day an Alien all unblest,
The parted hours I vainly mourn,
[underline]Hours[/underline], never, never to return - .
