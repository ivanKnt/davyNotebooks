In Thought, I yet may view the dome,
Where leaves my heart its sacred home
And ah! in thought, his glance arrest
Whose image fills my conscious breast,
But no - for other eyes than mine
Those orbs reflect their light divine
No beam of philosophic day
Glads the poor [underline]exile[/underline] far away!
No eye explores my once-loved place,
No sigh my vanished form shall trace
Yet here as roams the unblessed shade
My Spirit shall the scene pervade.
