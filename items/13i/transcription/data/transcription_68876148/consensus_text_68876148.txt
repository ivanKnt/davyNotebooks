Oh Ocean! on whose stormy breast
A wretched wanderer's head may rest,
Hence to thy billowy surge I cast
The painful memory of the past,
Hopes barren all! - and baneful fears!
And bodeful sighs and bitter tears
AErial dreams of bliss untrue, - -
These be Time's fatal revenue!
Beyond the great atlantic tide
Where blue Ontario's waters glide,
The pine crown'd steeps with bloom may glow,
And gales of spicy fragrance blow,
