But never there shall summer shed
Her flowers beneath His hallowed tread
And never there, the gales shall bear
[underline]His[/underline] praise - (sweet incense) to mine ear.
Now farewell fortune - farewell fear,
And hope - sweet syren; ever dear -
Now all, (save bankrupt-life) resigned,
I give me to the ruthless wind. - -
Yet still amid the vasty deep
One good, (a fraudful good) I keep, -
Love, to this heart, [underline]his[/underline] image gave --
This heart, shall bear it to the grave. -
