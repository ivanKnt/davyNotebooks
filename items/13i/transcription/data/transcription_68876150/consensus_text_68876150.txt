23
How oft the little sportive child
Seizing every flowret wild
With feeble hand half crops the stem
And leaves to die the drooping gem!
Unconscious of the slightest harm
His joyous breast with rapture warm
From bank to bank unthinking flies
Nor knows the weeping flowret dies. -
So have thy heedless glances stray'd,
And many a virgin heart betray'd,
From fair to fair their lightning's dart
And strike the gazer to the heart. - -
