25
Lost scenes by thee so sweetly traced
And by thy rainbow colours graced,
Call back the hours of hope and youth
Glowing with ecstasy and truth. -
Here let me pause, o'er transports past
And hang o'er joys not meant to last
How through the primrose studded walk
We wearied many an Hour in talk.
As in the soft and silent eve
Of noise and mirth we took our leave,
Twas here beneath the tangled hedge
The Rose we pluck'd, a simple pledge,
