Not the rich Rose with thorns beset,
But spring's fair flower, more humble yet,
And we exchanged the dewy prize
Our thoughts we changed without disguise.
[Short horizontal rule]
We lingered near the stunted oak
That rudely thro' the pathway broke
And gazed on its fantastic head
For half its aged form was dead.-
[Short horizontal rule]
Soft play'd the vernal breezes round
And the fresh dew-drops pearl'd the ground
Now as it reached the close of day
Unwilling we pursued our way
[Short horizontal rule]
