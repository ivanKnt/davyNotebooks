27
To gain the little busy Boat
Where we were wont the clifts to note
And that sequestered favorite glen
Unhaunted by the buzz of men.
[Short horizontal rule]
Or the lone summit of the wood
That brooded o'er the dusky flood -
Of these my harmless joys bereft
Faint is the sunshine that is left. -
[Short horizontal rule]
Yet still I glow with feelings warm
The wreck of many a mental storm,
These, are for thee, as fresh as true
As in my earliest days I knew. -
