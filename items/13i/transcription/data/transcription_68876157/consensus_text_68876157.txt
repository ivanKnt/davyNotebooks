Whene'er you speak, heav'n how the listening throng
Dwell on the melting music of your tongue!
Your arguments are emblems of your mien
Mild, but not faint, & forcing tho' serene.
But when the pow'r of eloquence you try,
Here lightning strikes & there soft breezes die
Oh mighty love! from thy unbounded pow'r
How shall the human bosom rest secure
How shall our thought avoid the various [insertion]snare[/insertion]
Or wisdom to our caution'd heart declare,
The different shapes thou pleasest to employ,
When bent to hurt & certain to destroy.
