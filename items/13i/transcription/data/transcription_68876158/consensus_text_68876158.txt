31
Lo! once again with Jocund sway
The morn endear'd by Lovers song
When Nature holds her holiday
The wild woods wintry brakes among
But let this sprightly morn away
In youths bright Calender enroll'd
And give to me by tapers ray
The [underline]star[/underline] of [underline]Genius[/underline] to behold
Whilst in my delighted ear
Philosophys sweet strain shall rest
In thy own image mild as fair
Shall science kindle in my breast
Thus e'en the tremulous chrystal bright
That on the Rose buds leaf reclines
