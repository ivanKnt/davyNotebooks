Thou that dost this scroll
survey
Turn not with disdain away
Nor deem these feeble lays
unfold
Tale too tender to be told
Hope long since proscribed this
breast
Love no more invades its nest,
For never simple virgins heart
Fell to Loves insidious dart
But haply in some subtle guise
With wily sighs or speaking sighs
As [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] fancy even, or fear 'arrayed
Hope the secret [unclear]pass[/unclear] betrayed.
Dark & sad this brow of care
No myrtle wreath entwines this
hair
Ne'er these lips of ashy hue
To the gentle dove shall cue
Never these wan cheeks disclose
