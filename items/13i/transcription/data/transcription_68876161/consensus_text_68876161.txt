Loves sweet bloom, its blushing rose
But this form of homeliest mold
Bears no sordid bosom cold
Though to Beauty all unknown
Beautys empire pleased I own
Genius with averted brow
Frowns & yet receives my vow
Nature, fortune all unkind
What but friendship sooths my
mind
Take then from this faithful breast
Where thou dwellst an honored
guest
From a Being void of aim
From a thing without a name
These honest [deletion]fe[unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] fervent blessings
take
For thine not for the givers sake
To thee may kindly fates assign
White robed honour, peace benign
Health & all her bright haired
train
