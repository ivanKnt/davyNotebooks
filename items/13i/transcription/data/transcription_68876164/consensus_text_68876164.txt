[underline]Made this day[/underline] June 30 1810 -
a very curious set of
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. - My object was,
to ascertain, if oxygene
exists or can be detected
in oxymuriatic acid
-- - Now I took Oxymuriate
Of Tin & exposed to Ammonia
the Ammonia was absorbed
without decomposition &
I attained, no oxide of
Tin, but a peculiar
volatile solid compound
consisting of Ammonia
