The images by passion caught
The eloquence which kindles thought
Which strength to weakness
can impart
And rouse again the exhausted heart
Like the refreshing streams that flow
From Cotopaxi crowned with snow
Wakening where Quitos plains
expand
Life upon the burning sand
Creating by its balmy power
The dewy herb & odorous flower
Ah never may the coming years
Be seen through gloom or mists
of tears
But tinged with rainbow hues & bright
As Autumns skies in evening light
Or if a transient cloud shoud rise
I [unclear]xx[/unclear] may it flow with brilliant dyes.
