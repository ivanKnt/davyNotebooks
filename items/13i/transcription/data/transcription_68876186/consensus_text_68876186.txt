- There mayst thou in thoughtful slumbers
Frame some soul awakening numbers
Some melancholy musings high
Breathing of immortality. -
When slanting suns through snow clouds
peep
And Nature seems to sink in sleep
Then may society impart
Its varied influence to thy heart
Not the vain influence of the crowd
Or sneering low or laughing loud
But that which from the wise & good
Flows pure as if in solitude
Creative noble free & kind
The lights the spirit of the mind
And mayst thou lovely woman give
Feelings which shall for ever live
-: Here mayst thou in thoughtful slumbers
From some soul awakening numbers
Some melancholy musings sigh
Some melancholy musings high
Breathing of immortality. -
When slanting [unclear]xxxx through snow clouds
And Nature seems to sink in sleep
Then may society impart
Its varied influence to thy heart -
Its varied influence to thy heart
Not the vain influence of the crowd
Or sneering low or laughing loud
But that which from the wise & good
Flows pure as if in solitude
Creative noble free & kind
He lights the spirit of the mind
To light the spirit of the mind
And mayst true lovely womans give
Feelings which shall for ever live
peep
