- When summer suns in fever [insertion]fervour[/insertion] glow
Then be thy haunt, the mountains
brow
Where blue amidst the brilliant
sky
Its giant helms are lifted high
Above the cloudy canopy;
Which spreading like a sea of light
In dappled colours fleecy bright
As if a sudden fairy birth
At once commingles heaven & earth.
When their rich dress the woods
display
And quicker wanes the tranquil
day
Then mayst these haunt the
woodland
streams
Fitted for poetic dreams.
Where the Cushats mournful sigh
Tells loves sweet season is gone by
