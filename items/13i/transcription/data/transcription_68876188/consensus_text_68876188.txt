May every season of the year
For thee some new delights prepare.
In spring nature the rural scenes
Of Highland glens or pastoral plains
There when the moon is parting day
Sheds through the trees her trembling
ray
Upon the balmy moss beneath
Mayst thou the softest Zephyr
breathe
And listen to the songs that move
The plumed Choristers to love.
Or if the moonshine is not seen
May glowworms light thee on the green
Or that fair star whose tranquil ray
Seems in the solar blaze to play
As if it fed upon it streams
Of light & caught its dying
beams
