Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] 4 1812,
Hail loved one to thy natal morn
May every coming year adorn
Thy mind with new born charms
& powers
And never may the fleeting hours
Tell thee of aught but happiness
May Nature in her loveliest dress
For thee frame flowery chaplets new
Of roses fresh in nectar dew.
May Health illume thy brilliant eye
And bid thy locks of [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]ebon[/insertion] dye
In crisped ringlets wildly flow
Upon thy lovely neck of snow
preserve its freshness to thy form
Thy cheeks with living roses warm
And in thy expressive figure trace
The [deletion]not[/deletion] mildest dignity of grace
