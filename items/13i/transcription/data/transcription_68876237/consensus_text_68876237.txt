The most magnificent & noble Nature
Have I not worshipped thee with such [insertion]a love[/insertion]
As never Mortal Man before displayed -
Adored thee in "thy Majesty of [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] [insertion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/insertion]
And searched into thy [deletion]privacies[/deletion]
[deletion]But[/deletion] Hidden & mysterious [insertion]ways[/insertion]
As Poet as philosopher, as Sage -
As lover - not as
[deletion]A[/deletion] A single spot of brilliant green
A single cabin there is seen
And oer the mountain
stretched his wide domain
The Cottager who dwelleth there
Seeks thy presence far & near.
