Thou to whom heaven its noblest gifts assigned
Blest Friend of Man, the darling of mankind,
Elect of Science on whose infant head
Truth's angel power the full orb'd Halo spread,
Awhile farewell - awhile in Freedom roam,
Far from the peopled walls, the vocal dome
To distant cliffs, on whose hoar hermit brow
The passing clouds like pilgrims lowly bow
Or, "some green silent dell amid the hills,
Where rolls the music of unhaunted rills,
Some bank that scarce the travelled wild bee [insertion]knows[/insertion]
Where the lone nightbirds' song responsless flows,
And the sweet south, his destined course delayed
Sleeps in the fragrant bud or dewy blade
Go Thou, nor scorn this simple wreath to wear
Though thine the brighter Laurel never sere,

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00008|dnp13i006pp|68876133[/page]
Though carved in Adamant, thy honoured name
Lives in the [insertion][unclear]ar[/unclear][/insertion] ark of ages, lives to Fame.
Farewell - thy form shall fancy's eye pursue
With prayers, with vows, with wishes ever true,
And ah! if aught of good or bliss impart,
The benedictions of a faithful Heart,
If sorcery divine or holy spell
In the firm pledge of souls devoted dwell,
When, breathed thy name in consecrated sighs
From bosoms pure, the orisons arise,
Then, thou [underline]thrice blest[/underline] a charmed life shall [insertion]bear![/insertion]
To Earth, to Heaven, to Man, to Demon, dear;
Then shall no Fiend, no harpy dire of pain
Thy threshold blast, thy mansion's peace profane,
Nor care, the beldam care shall haunt thy way,}
Nor on thy breast, her touch unhallowed lay,}
That wan and withering palm, in which all blooms decay:}

Along thy path, may fruits autumnal spread,
Whilst vernal blossoms, spring beneath thy tread,
Still to thine eye, Life's green ear'd joy expand
While bends the purple vintage to thy hand.-
To thine own sphere, to nature's temple, go
Pause, at her altar pause, with reverence low,
The one great spirit [underline]Truth[/underline], invoke, adore,
And hymns of praise, of holy rapture pour.
For [underline]Thee[/underline], the secret portal open flies,}
Free to thy feet the sanctuary lies,}
And the veil's wavy folds, the mystic folds arise,}
Beloved of Heaven! for Thee, be formed the bower
Of leaves impervious to the solar power,
Where scarce the arrowy beam may glide between
The rude arcade of deepest, densest green,

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00010|dnp13i008pp|68876135[/page]
Where as in Eden's blissful shade of rest
When Man held converse with an angel guest,
Mayst Thou, enbosomed in thy still retreat,
The blue-eyed cherub contemplation greet.
There muse, intent on Nature's spotless page
To some a blank, but to the inspired sage,
The book of Life, where Love and Wisdom shine
The almighty thought, "creation's type" divine.
Go with truth's wand, the giant shades arrest
That linger on the mountain's sinewy breast,
And mid sepulchral rocks that proudly stand,
The Pyramids unwrought of mortal hand,
Mid ruins sanctified by elder time
When rose the spirit of the floods sublime

Draw from the dusky ore, the silent stone
The ancient records of a world unknown,
Dash from the sea born base, oblivion's wave
Redeem the chart of ages, from the grave.
Or wilt thou by a purer spirit led
Philanthropy - the grassy woodlands tread,
What time the Lark, harmonious herald! hails
His minstrel brethren of the woods and dales,
When hasting from the dewy tents away
From hill to hill swift flies the golden day,
At living Nature's "rich mysterious shrine"
Detect the unwrought vegetable mine,
With chemic care, the shining furrows trace
And scatter blessings on the human race.

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00012|dnp13i010pp|68876137[/page]
Yet here - though sweet the scene - forbear to stay
A different region claims thy potent sway -
A new creation, by thy forming will
From chaos called, to thee obedient still,
Where dwells thy voice on beauty's raptured ear
Experience listens, Folly drops her sneer
Ah! not to Sadness, to regret resign
This infant Orb of science, only thine.
For absent Thou - what friendly spirit calls
To this dark roof - these desolated walls,
The vase of science or pierian strain
For [underline]Thee, the Absent[/underline], roams the restless eye}
To thee reverts the ever vagrant sigh}
Unkindled by thy breath the flames of science die!}

Soul of that World! which at thy word arose
That word which artless as persuasive flows
Slave to no sovereign - to no palace known
The minister of Nature's power alone,
Ah here without or crown or empire reign
The Heart thy throne - the mind thy pure domain
Unsceptred Chief! here reign by Heaven designed
To conquer Folly and to bless Mankind.

Oh! were I rich in nature's lore
For [underline]Him[/underline] I would her worlds explore
For Him, with pious avarice sweep
The treasures of the mineral deep
And steal the starry gems that throw
Pale lustre o'er the realms below,
Sweet were each care and soft each toil
If once rewarded with his smile,
And cheaply all could I resign
If but [underline]his[/underline] hand [underline]received[/underline] from mine.
But me, alas! the fates unkind
Within a narrow sphere confined,

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00016|dnp13i014pp|68876141[/page]
Nor fortune hailed my natal hour
Nor wisdom gave her sacred dower.
Go - simple gift thou humble band
Go, thou unformed by venal hand
Thy destined Lord's acceptance sue
And with thee take this last adieu:
And if a gentle heart he bear
A Heart to gentle spirits dear,
Then shall he to a stranger's prayer
Consent a stranger's pledge to wear,
And, ah, these conscious eyes again
Shall hail the tributary chain
Oh Thou! whose influence oft hath blest
The little world within this breast,

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00017|dnp13i015pp|68876142[/page]

Whose image gilds the pensive hour
Of fancy's vision-weaving power,
Though, nought this gift so simple, boast
And but some sighs the giver cost
Yet oh with smile benignant deign
These links to touch, to wear this chain
And if (as Fame the unwilling ear
Informs) a softer chain Thou bear,
Then may no darkling shade destroy
The fabric of thy promised joy,
And may all spirits blest and good
Unseen, who haunt or wave or wood
AEthereal nature's sportive train
On Thee "sweet influences rain."

And breathe a sense no words impart
Well augured of the thrilling heart.
But if with rigid scowl severe
My lowly suit thou shame to hear,
My simple gift if Thou disdain
All reckless of another's pain,
Not long thy stream of bliss shall flow
Nor long thy torch of rapture glow,
Who from the lisp of asking child
Witholds the fragrant blossom wild,
Who from the wretched captive's power
Uproots the solitary flower,
[deletion]Th[/deletion] Whose contumely blasts the sighs
That from the guileless bosom rise,

Oh not for him Love's hallowed Urn
The golden light of life shall burn
Oh not for him the aethereal flame
That quivers through the feeling frame;
Inert, dull, earthly is the mould
That bears an iron bosom cold -
Oh yield then to a guiltless prayer,
The simple chain consent to wear
That chain accepted let me view
Then look a long, a sad adieu.
And oft the dewy skies beneath
When all of peace of love shall breathe,
Oft in some cloud that sails serene
Alone in heaven's blue ocean seen,

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00020|dnp13i018pp|68876145[/page]
When slow the paly shadows glide
The violet's perfumed bank beside
And their sweet buds the flowrets close
And, wakes the heart, while all repose
Oft e'en from air, thy form, thy face
Thy shape, thy last, last look retrace
And with a grateful tear again
Review the consecrated chain.

Rude Winter! iron sceptred power,
No more I greet thy joyless hour,
[underline]His[/underline] smile no longer gilds thy form
Nor breathes his music, in thy storm;
Rude Winter, I abhor thee now
Thou tyrant of the obdurate brow!
Wild ruin marks thy stern career
Fell spoiler of the aged year. -
This day November's frowns invest
This day an Alien all unblest,
The parted hours I vainly mourn,

In Thought, I yet may view the dome,
Where leaves my heart its sacred home
And ah! in thought, his glance arrest
Whose image fills my conscious breast,
But no - for other eyes than mine
Those orbs reflect their light divine
No beam of philosophic day
Glads the poor [underline]exile[/underline] far away!
No eye explores my once-loved place,
No sigh my vanished form shall trace
Yet here as roams the unblessed shade
My Spirit shall the scene pervade.

Oh Ocean! on whose stormy breast
A wretched wanderer's head may rest,
Hence to thy billowy surge I cast
The painful memory of the past,
Hopes barren all! - and baneful fears!
And bodeful sighs and bitter tears
AErial dreams of bliss untrue, - -
These be Time's fatal revenue!
Beyond the great atlantic tide
Where blue Ontario's waters glide,
The pine crown'd steeps with bloom may glow,
And gales of spicy fragrance blow,

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00024|dnp13i022pp|68876149[/page]
But never there shall summer shed
Her flowers beneath His hallowed tread
And never there, the gales shall bear
[underline]His[/underline] praise - (sweet incense) to mine ear.
Now farewell fortune - farewell fear,
And hope - sweet syren; ever dear -
Now all, (save bankrupt-life) resigned,
I give me to the ruthless wind. - -
Yet still amid the vasty deep
One good, (a fraudful good) I keep, -
Love, to this heart, [underline]his[/underline] image gave --
This heart, shall bear it to the grave. -

How oft the little sportive child
Seizing every flowret wild
With feeble hand half crops the stem
And leaves to die the drooping gem!
Unconscious of the slightest harm
His joyous breast with rapture warm
From bank to bank unthinking flies
Nor knows the weeping flowret dies. -
So have thy heedless glances stray'd,
And many a virgin heart betray'd,
From fair to fair their lightning's dart
And strike the gazer to the heart. - -

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00026|dnp13i024pp|68876151[/page]
Those eyes with liquid lustre bright
In softer eyes have quench'd their light
Eyes, that withdraw their timid beams
And only dare to gaze in dreams. -
And yet regardless of thy power
Some tender maid each changeful hour
Is doom'd in silent grief to pine
Or paint it in the glowing line.

Lost scenes by thee so sweetly traced
And by thy rainbow colours graced,
Call back the hours of hope and youth
Glowing with ecstasy and truth. -
Here let me pause, o'er transports past
And hang o'er joys not meant to last
How through the primrose studded walk
We wearied many an Hour in talk.
As in the soft and silent eve
Of noise and mirth we took our leave,
Twas here beneath the tangled hedge
The Rose we pluck'd, a simple pledge,

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11309-000-00028|dnp13i026pp|68876153[/page]
Not the rich Rose with thorns beset,
But spring's fair flower, more humble yet,
And we exchanged the dewy prize
Our thoughts we changed without disguise.
[Short horizontal rule]
We lingered near the stunted oak
That rudely thro' the pathway broke
And gazed on its fantastic head
For half its aged form was dead.-
[Short horizontal rule]
Soft play'd the vernal breezes round
And the fresh dew-drops pearl'd the ground
Now as it reached the close of day
Unwilling we pursued our way

To gain the little busy Boat
Where we were wont the clifts to note
And that sequestered favorite glen
Unhaunted by the buzz of men.
[Short horizontal rule]
Or the lone summit of the wood
That brooded o'er the dusky flood -
Of these my harmless joys bereft
Faint is the sunshine that is left. -
[Short horizontal rule]
Yet still I glow with feelings warm
The wreck of many a mental storm,
These, are for thee, as fresh as true
As in my earliest days I knew. -

When thou just bounding into life
Alike unknown to grief or strife
Panted with transport for the hour
When the whole world should feel thy power.

With thee for ever could I stay,
Thy presence makes all nature glad,
With thee pass each successive day,
Nor ever feel one moment sad.
Oh! ev'ry moment seems an age,
Now that I'm far my love from thee,
But thoughts of meeting thee assuage,
The grief which else would fatal be.

Whene'er you speak, heav'n how the listening throng
Dwell on the melting music of your tongue!
Your arguments are emblems of your mien
Mild, but not faint, & forcing tho' serene.
But when the pow'r of eloquence you try,
Here lightning strikes & there soft breezes die
Oh mighty love! from thy unbounded pow'r
How shall the human bosom rest secure
How shall our thought avoid the various [insertion]snare[/insertion]
Or wisdom to our caution'd heart declare,
The different shapes thou pleasest to employ,
When bent to hurt & certain to destroy.

Turn not with disdain away
Nor deem these feeble lays

Tale too tender to be told
Hope long since proscribed this

Love no more invades its rest,

Fell to Loves insidious dart
But haply in some subtle guise
With wily sighs or speaking sighs
As [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] fancy even, or fear 'arrayed
Hope the secret [unclear]pass[/unclear] betrayed.
Dark & sad this brow of care
No myrtle wreath entwines this

Never these wan cheeks disclose

What but friendship sooths my

Where thou dwellst an honored

From a thing without a name

a very curious set of

- Ammonia [deletion]likewise[/deletion] contains
Water, perhaps in
considerable quantities
but to enable it
to furnish the whole
of the Hydrogene disengaged
it ought to contain
more than half its
weight which is
very improbable. -
- The Source then to
which the Hydrogene
must be referred is
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] the decomposition

but if the Hydrogene
is furnished by the
Potassium the other
element or elements
of this body must
combine with the
Ammonia; but this
cannot be mere Potash
for Potash has
no affinity for
[underline]Ammonia[/underline]-
- But Ammonia it
is evident contains
Oxygene; & Potassium is capable

[deletion]reducing[/deletion] bringing it into
a form in which it
combines with mercury.
- It is probable then
that in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
a part of the Potassium
is [deletion]oxydated[/deletion] converted
into protoxide by
Oxygene from the
Ammonia - & that
the remaining Potassium
but the Hydrogene

The eloquence which kindles thought
Which strength to weakness

And rouse again the exhausted heart
Like the refreshing streams that flow
From Cotopaxi crowned with snow
Wakening where Quitos plains
expand
Life upon the burning sand
Creating by its balmy power
The dewy herb & odorous flower
Ah never may the coming years
Be seen through gloom or mists

But tinged with rainbow hues & bright
As Autumns skies in evening light
Or if a transient cloud shoud rise
Soon may it glow with brilliant dyes

Frame some soul awakening numbers
Some melancholy musings high
Breathing of immortality. -
When slanting suns through snow clouds
peep
And Nature seems to sink in sleep
Then may society impart
Its varied influence to thy heart
Not the vain influence of the crowd
Or sneering low or laughing loud
But that which from the wise & good
Flows pure as if in solitude
Creative noble free & kind
The lights the spirit of the mind
And mayst thou lovely woman give
Feelings which shall for ever live

Where blue amidst the brilliant

In dappled colours fleecy bright
As if a sudden fairy birth
At once commingles heaven & earth.
When their rich dress the woods

And quicker wanes the tranquil

Then mayst there haunt the

Fitted for poetic dreams.
Where the Cushats mournful sigh
Tells loves sweet season is gone by

May every season of the year
For thee some new delights prepare.
In spring nature the rural scenes
Of Highland glens or pastoral plains
There where the moon in parting day
Sheds through the trees her trembling
ray
Upon the balmy moss beneath
Mayst thou the softest Zephyr
breathe
And listen to the songs that move
The plumed Choristers to love.
Or if the moonshine is not seen
May glowworms light thee on the green
Or that fair star whose tranquil ray
Seems in the solar blaze to play
As if it fed upon it streams
Of light & caught its dying
beams

Of roses fresh in matin dew.
