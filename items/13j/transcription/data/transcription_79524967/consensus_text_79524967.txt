The man who supposes
that [underline]Nature[/underline] is exhausted
because He is satisfied
with some discoveries
of his own is like
that Person who
having [deletion]quenched his[/deletion] [insertion]drank[/insertion]
[deletion]thirst[/deletion] from the Ganges,
considers the river
as drained because
He has quenched his
thirst
