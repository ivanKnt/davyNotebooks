There had the sky lark at the break of Day
Thrown his wild woodnotes on the fragrant breeze
The nightingale had tuned his lovelorn lay
While the bright moonbeam trampled through the trees
And oft his peac[insertion]e[/insertion]ful spirit would have dwelt
Amidst those halls to social Converse clear
The charm of long remembrance would have felt
Glad in your Joy & gloomy in your care
