-[underline]To A. [unclear]nna[/unclear][/underline] 1803, [unclear]L[/unclear]
When in lifes first golden morn
I left my stormy native shore
My pathway was without a thorn
With roses it seemed covered o'er
Ambition thrilled within my breast.
My heart with feverish hope beat high,
Hope alone disturbed my rest
Hope only bade me heave a sigh
In pride of untried power, my mind
A visionary empire saw.
A world in which it hoped to find
Its own high strength a master law
