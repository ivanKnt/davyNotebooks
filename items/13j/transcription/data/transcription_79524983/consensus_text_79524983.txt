Think not that I forget the days
When first through rough unhaunted ways
We moved along the mountains side
Where [deletion]a[/deletion]Avon meets the Severn tide.,
When in the spring of youthful thought
The hours of Confidence we caught
And Nature's Children free and wild
Rejoiced, or grieved, or frowned or smiled
As wayward fancy chanced to move
Our minds to hope, or fear, or love
Since that time of transient pleasure
Eight long years have filled their measure
And [deletion]scenes[/deletion] [insertion]scenes[/insertion] and objects grand and new
Have crowded on my dazzled view.
Visions of beauty, types of Heaven,
Unasked for kindness freely given
Art!- - Nature, in their noblest dress
The City and the wilderness.
The world in all its varying forms
Contentment's calms. Ambition's storms
