Yet still in such a busy scene
And such a period passed between
The recollections never die
Of our early sympathy.
And in the good that warms my heart
Your friendship bears a living part,
With many a thought & feeling twined
Of influence healthy, noble kind,
Virtues from your example caught,
And without [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]saws[/insertion] or precept taught
The proof, this tranquil moment gives
How vivid the remembrance lives
For een in Natures forms, I see
Some strong memorials of thee.
The autumnal foliage of the wood
The Tranquil flowing of the flood
The Down with purple heath oer spread
The awful cliffs gigantic head
The moonbeam in the azure sky
Are blended with thy memory
