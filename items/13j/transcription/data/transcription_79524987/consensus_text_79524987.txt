[underline]To Athens[/underline]
Oh Athens! child of elder glory
The first the best renowned in story.
From whom, amidst the births of time
Sprung forth immaculate sublime,
The [underline]love[/underline] of Letters, science glowing
And an holy charm bestowing
On all the natural forms of things,
Giving, to the muses, wings
To raise them from the paths of pleasure.,
From [deletion]ogies[/deletions] [insertion]orgies[/insertion] in the lydian measure
Amidst dark Cyprian vineyards given.-
