To the Eternal light of heaven.
To call them from the thoughts of [underline]error[/underline].
From superstitions midnight terror,~
From the tyrants gold bought praise
From whining parasitic lays
To intellects more wholsome food
The magnificent and good. -
[underline]From[/underline] base of popular applause
From judgements foul unhallowed laws
To that which sacred & refined
things the inimitable mind
knowledge that never [underline]can decay[/underline]
