23
Exhaustless as the unfathomed sea -
That to the her [underline]lover[/underline] gives
That [underline]vital dew[/underline] which each that lives:
Absorbs - diamonds with joy inhales
Whether from the peaceful gales -
Breathing oer the happy [underline]isles[/underline].
Where nature is profuse of smiles.
or the [underline]keen north[/underline] whose furclad Host
Ranged upon the [underline]Arctic Coast[/underline]:-
Beneath the light of moon and stars
Wait the day spring from afar
And in their long & tedious night
In Visions - catch the solar light
