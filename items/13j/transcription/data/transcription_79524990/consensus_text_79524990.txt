[underline]Athens[/underline]; the poets [underline]darling theme[/underline]
Athens the patriots socred dream
Where [underline]luxury[/underline] did a form a name
Which all the virtues [underline]might illume[/underline]
Where Venus wore minervas plume
Whose warned by Beauties charm the sage
Was youthful in the vale of Age
Where woman lovely shone suprem
About the poets loftiest dream -
And to [underline]philosophy, had given[/underline]
Elisium and a mortal heaven,
