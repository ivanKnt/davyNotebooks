She yeilded not to gold alone
Nor to golconda, glittering stones
she loved; whatever could expand
the soul the beautiful, [underline]the grand[/underline]
Whatever phidias has designed
[underline]Expressive[/underline] of the being mind,
came to her fancy like the sound
Of mountain torrents murmering round
But for the bodies varying form
The ins[insertion]en[/insertion]ate marble was as warm
As strong, to fix her beaming eye.
Which alone for energy.
