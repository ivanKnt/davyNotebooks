Mucrish and Arokil ye pair
Of mighty brethren rising fair
Amids the summers evenings western light
clouds might ye be, so bright your hue
So dence your purple, in the blue
That ushers in the night.
Were ye not motionless: your forms
unchanged by breezes or by storms
The same from day to day from Age to Age.
