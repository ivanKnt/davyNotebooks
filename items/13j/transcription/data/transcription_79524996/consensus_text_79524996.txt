Unaltered - midst the wrecks of time
Scorning in giants strength sublime
The whirlwinds & the [underline]lightenings [unclear]Cage[/unclear][/underline]
The whirlwinds of the [underline]lightening's rage[/underline]
Summers Heath blasts; winters snows
Disturb not your supreme repose -
not the mild of spring
Cloathing the lowlands, all in [underline]green[/underline]
Creating round a joyful scene
of change to you; can bring
Hot oer the purple Heath expands
Its foliage oer your blanched sands;-
