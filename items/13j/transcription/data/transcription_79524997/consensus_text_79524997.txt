your Rocks alone the yellow lichen covers
In tints as own
No shapes of life are known
save where the Eagle Hovers -
His screams the mountain torrents sound
The mountain breezes whistling round
The distant murmers of the western waves
Compose the music wild and rude
of your unhaunted [underline]solitude[/underline]. -
Else silent as the grave. 
The glens that ranged around your feet
In grand confusion seem to meet
Else silent as the grave. ......
Else silent as the grave. ...... sound
His dreams the mountain torrents sound
Hi screams the mountain torrent s sound
