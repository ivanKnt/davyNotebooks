8 grains of potassium acting on
12 cubic inches of ammonia, evolved
between 7 & 8 cubic inches of hydrogene
& absorbed the whole from the
ammonia, the substance produced
when heated emits first ammonia
then mixtures of ammonia nitrogen
& hydrogene, now it is evident
that after this the substance
remaining must be an oxyde of
potassium combined with nitrogene
containing as much oxygene
