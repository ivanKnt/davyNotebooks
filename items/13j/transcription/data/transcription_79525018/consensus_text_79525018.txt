as was contained in 3/5 of ammonia
now when water is made to act
upon it, potash & ammonia are
produced & gas is evolved, now
the potash would have gained
as much oxygene from the am
monia, as would be equal to
that contained in 1/5 of it, there
fore the potassium will not
decompose as much water, as
if it was pure, hence there will
less hydrogene evolved to saturate
the nitrogene, nitrogene then on
this supposition ought to be dis
engaged, & if disengaged the
quantity of it will indicate the
quantity of oxygene in ammonia
which will be [unclear]x[/unclear] = 3 รท 2
