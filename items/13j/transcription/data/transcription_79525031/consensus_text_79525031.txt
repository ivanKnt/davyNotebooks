And may the moon full orbed
 & bright
Pour forth for thee "its silver light
- And bid thee in the moon of flowers
-Seek pastoral scenes & woodland 
bowers
 Which the healthful breeze
& know
The feelings that from Nature
flow
Kindle out hopes, be chilled with fears
Nor seek to look [deletion]through[/deletion] [insertion]for[/insertion] coming years
Least they should dimly glean
through tears
