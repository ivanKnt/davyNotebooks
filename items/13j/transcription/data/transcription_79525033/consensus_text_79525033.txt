- Where mountains; lift their summits
high:
- Dark blue amidst the bright [deletion]blue[/deletion]
sky.
-. Where [deletion]fleecy[/deletion] clouds in silver radiance
sail.
Upon the healthful upland gale;
-And never may the coming
years
Be seen through clouds or 
mists of tears:
-But tinged with rainbow hues 
& bright
As Autumn clouds in evening 
light.
Ah may thy heart no conquest 
prove
No care unless it spring
from love.
As if the islands of the blest
Rising amidst a sea of light
-Than must then sit upon the
brow.- Where rested last the summer
snow
