[underline]And in the time when nature[/underline] [insertion]slumbers;[/insertion]

Is heard [deletion][unclear]alone[/unclear][/deletion] lone minstrel [insertion]of the dale;[/insertion]
Pour forth thy[deletion]ine[/deletion] own poetic numbers
- Or if the moonbeams are seen [deletion][insertion]not bright:[/insertion][/deletion]
= May Glowworms light thee [insertion]on the green.[/insertion]
Or the fair star whose living [insertion]ray;[/insertion]
Is nearest to the expiring day; -
And which amidst the twilight [insertion][deletion]gleams[/deletion] seems[/insertion]
As if it caught the [insertion]hasting[/insertion] [deletion]pas[/deletion][deletion]fly[/deletion]ing [deletion]gle[/deletion]beams;
- And treasured in its copious arc
