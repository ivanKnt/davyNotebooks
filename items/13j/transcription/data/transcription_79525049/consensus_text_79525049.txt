Then when the moon in parting [insertion]day[/insertion]
Sheds through the trees her [insertion]trembling ray[/insertion]
Upon the balmy moss beneath
Mayst thou the evening Zephyr [insertion]breathe;[/insertion]
- And listen to the songs; which [insertion]move[/insertion]
- The plumed Choristers to love.
- Or if the moon[deletion]beams are[/deletion][insertion]shine is[/insertion] [insertion]not seen[/insertion]
May Glow worms light thee [insertion]on the green.[/insertion]
Or the fair star whose [deletion]living[/deletion] [insertion]tranquil[/insertion]
ray
Seems in the solar blaze to play;
As if it fed upon its streams
Of light & caught its dying beams.
