Soul melancholy musing high
Breathing of immortality. .
When slanting suns through snow [insertion]clouds peep[/insertion]
And Nature seems to sink in [insertion]sleep[/insertion]
Then may Society impart
Its varied influence to thy [insertion]heart[/insertion]
Not the vain influence of the [insertion]crowd[/insertion]
Or sneering low or laughing loud
But that which from the [insertion]wise & good[/insertion]
Flows pure as if in [insertion]solitude.[/insertion]
