Ah never may the coming years
Be seen through [insertion]gloom[/insertion] [deletion]clouds[/deletion] or [insertion]mists of tears[/insertion]
But tinged with rainbow hues [insertion]& bright.[/insertion]
As Autumns [deletion]clouds[/deletion][insertion]skies[/insertion] in evening light
No grief no anguish mast thou [insertion]prove[/insertion]
No care unless it spring from [insertion]love.[/insertion]
