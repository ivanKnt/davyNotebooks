May health illume thy

eye.
And bid thy [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] tresses[/deletion] [insertion]locks of raven [deletion]fly[/deletion] shine[/insertion]
In wisped ringlets wildly flow
Upon thy [deletion]graceful[/deletion] [insertion]lovely[/insertion] neck of snow;
[deletion]preserve its freshness to thy [insertion]form[/insertion][/deletion]
Preserve its freshness to thy [insertion]form,[/insertion]
Thy cheeks with living roses [insertion]warmd[/insertion]
[deletion]And oer thy limbs[/deletion]
- And in thy [deletion][unclear]gestures[/unclear] motion[/deletion] [insertion]moving figure[/insertion] [insertion]trace[/insertion]
The [deletion]living[/deletion] [insertion]breathing[/insertion] dignity of grace.
