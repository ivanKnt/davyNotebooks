Plunged in the Ouses fair and tranquil stream
And had he fallen a victim to the tide
What had he lost, save lifes short feverish dream.
But those, whose kindness oft had chured his soul
The memory of whose virtues filled his breast,
Had for a moment mourned his hapless fall
And in his Island grave, had bade him rest

-[underline]To A. [unclear]nna[/unclear][/underline] 1803, [unclear]L[/unclear]
When in lifes first golden morn
I left my stormy native shore
My pathway was without a thorn
With roses it seemed covered o'er
Ambition thrilled within my breast.
My heart with feverish hope beat high,
Hope alone disturbed my rest
Hope only bade me heave a sigh
In pride of untried power, my mind
A visionary empire saw.
A world in which it hoped to find
Its own high strength a master law

Its love was wild its friendship free
Its passions changeful as the light
That on an aprils day you see
Changeful and yet ever bright.
Years of pain have passed away.
Its former lineaments are gone
Hope gives it now a gentler ray
Ambition rules it not alone
The forms of Holy truth severe
Are the fair thoughts with which it [unclear]glows[/unclear]
And if it ever feels a tear
that tear in purest passion flows

Fled is its anguish and its joys
Is such as reason may approve
No storms its quietness destroy
Yet it is ever warm with love
Its pleasures fate & nature give
And fate and nature will not fly
It hopes in usefulness to live
In dreams of endless bliss to die.

Think not that I forget the days
When first through rough unhaunted ways
We moved along the mountains side
Where [deletion]a[/deletion]Avon meets the Severn tide.,
When in the spring of youthful thought
The hours of Confidence we caught
And Nature's Children free and wild
Rejoiced, or grieved, or frowned or smiled

Our minds to hope, or fear, or love
Since that time of transient pleasure
Eight long years have filled their measure
And [deletion]scenes[/deletion] [insertion]scenes[/insertion] and objects grand and new
Have crowded on my dazzled view.
Visions of beauty, types of Heaven,
Unasked for kindness freely given

Contentment's calms. Ambition's storms

the potash would have gained
as much oxygene from the am

that contained in 1/5 of it, there
fore the potassium will not
decompose as much water, as
if it was pure, hence there will
less hydrogene evolved to saturate
