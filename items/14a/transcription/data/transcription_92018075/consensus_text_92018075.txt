I now entered this great
city in a very different
tone of mind - one of
settled melancholy, not
merely produced by the
mournful event which re
-called one to my country
but owing likewise to an
entire change in the
condition of my physical,
moral & intellectual being.
My health was gone,
my ambition was satis-
fied, I was no longer excited
by the desire of distinction;
what I loved most tenderly
was in the grave & to
take a metaphor derived
