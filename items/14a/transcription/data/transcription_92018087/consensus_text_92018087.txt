for me & where events occured
that I shall never forget. We
passed into the Alpine country
of Austria by Lintz on the
Danube & followed the course
of the Traun to Gmunden on
the Traun see or lake of the
Traun when we [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]halted[/insertion] for some
days. If I were disposed to
indulge in minute picturesque
descriptions I might occupy
hours with details of the various
characters of the enchanting
scenery in this neighbourhood.
The vales have that pastoral
beauty & constant verdure
which is so familiar to us
in England, with similar
enclosures & hedgerows  & fruit
& forest trees. Above are noble
hills planted with beeches &
oaks. Mountains bound the
view, here covered with pines
