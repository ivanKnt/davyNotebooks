over which it falls & the cliffs
& woods by which it is overhung.
- In this spot an accident
which had nearly been fatal
to me, occasioned the renewal
of my acquaintance in an
extraordinary manner with the
mysterious unknown stranger.
Eubathes who was very fond
of fly-fishing was amusing
himself by catching graylings
for our dinner in the stream
above the fall. I took one of
the boats which are used for
descending the canal or lock
artificially cut in the rock by
the side of the fall, on which
salt & wood are usually
transported from Upper Austria
to the Danube, & I desired
two of the peasants to assist
my servant in permitting the
boat to descend by a rope
