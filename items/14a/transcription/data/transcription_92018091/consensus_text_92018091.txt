easy to arrest the boat before
it entered the rapidly descending
water of the sluice; & I called
out to them to use their united
force to reach the longest pole
accross the water that I might
be stable to catch the end of
it in my hand, & at this
moment I felt perfect security
but a breeze of wind suddenly
came over the valley & blew
from the nearest bank, the
boat was turned by it out
of the side current & thrown
nearer to the middle of the
river & I soon saw that I
was likely to be precipitated
over the cataract. My servant
& the boatman rushed into
the water; but it was too deep
to enable them to reach the
boat. I was soon in the white
water of the descending stream
& my danger was inevitable
