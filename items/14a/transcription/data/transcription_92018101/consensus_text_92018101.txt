[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] We must be many hundred 
feet below the surface yet the
temperature of this cavern is
fresh & agreeable.-
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. - This cavern has
the mean temperature of the
atmosphere which is the case with
all subterranean cavities re-
moved from the influence of
the solar light & heat; - & in so
hot a day in August as this,
I know no more agreeable or
salutary manner of taking
a cold bath than in descending
to a part of the atmosphere out
of the influence of those causes
which occasion it's elevated
temperature. -
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] Have you sir, been
in this country before?.
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. - This is the third
summer that I have made it
the scene of an annual visit.
