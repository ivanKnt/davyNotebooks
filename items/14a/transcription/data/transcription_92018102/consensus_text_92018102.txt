Independently of the natural beauties
found in Illyria & the various
sources of amusement which
a traveller fond of natural
history may find in this region
it has had a peculiar object
of interest for me, are the
extraordinary animals which
are found in the bottom of
it's subterranean cavities. I
allude to the Proteus Anguinus
a far greater wonder of nature 
than any of those which the
Baron Valvasor [otherwork_284]detailed[/otherwork_284] to
the Royal Society a century &
half ago as belonging to
Carniola, with far too rom
antic an air for a philosopher
[underline]Philalethes.[/underline] - I have seen these
animals in passing through this
country before, but I should be
very glad to be better aquainted
with this natural history.
