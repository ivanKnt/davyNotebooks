[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] We shall soon be
in that part of the grotto where
they are found; & I shall
willingly communicate the little
that I have been able to learn
inspecting their natural characters
& habits. -
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] The grotto now becomes
really magnificent. I have seen
no subterraneous cavity with
so many traits of beauty &
of grandeur. The irregularity
of its surface, the magnitude
of the masses broken in pieces
which compose it's sides &
which seem torn from the
bosom of the mountain by some
great conventions of nature
their dark colours & deep
shades form a singular
contrast with the beauty, uniform-
ity, I may say order, &
of the white stalactical concretions
which hang from the canopy
