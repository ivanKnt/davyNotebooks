the perfume of a heavy atmosphere
& my emotion on this subject was
not destroyed when I heard from
a celebrated anatomist to whom
I sent the specimens I had
collected, that the organization
of the species of the Proteus was
analogous to that of one of the
sauri, the remains of which
are found in the other secondary
strata. It was said at this
time that no generative organs
had been discovered in any
of the specimens examined
by physiologists & this lent a
weight to my opinion of the
possibility of their being actually
new creations; which I suppose
you will condemn as wholly
visionary & unphilosophical
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] - From the tone in
which you make your statement
I think you yourself consider them
