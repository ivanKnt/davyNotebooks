The volumes of elastic fluid
inspired & expired (making
allowance for change of temperature)
are the same & if ponderable
agents only were to be regarded
it would appear as if the
only use of respiration were

quantity of carbonaceous matter;
but it is probable that this
is only a secondary object
& that the change produced by
respiration upon the blood is
of a much more important

state has properties which are
very characteristic; it gives out
