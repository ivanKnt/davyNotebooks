consume the greatest quantity
of air: and, under different cir-
cumstances of action or repose the
heat is in great measure pro-
portional to the quantity of oxygen
consumed. - Then those animals
which absorb the smallest quantity
of air are cold blooded. Another
argument in favour of D[superscript]r.[/superscript] Black's
opinion is, the change of colour
of blood from black to red,
which seems to show that it
loses carbon.
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] With the highest
respect for the memory of D[superscript]r.[/superscript] Black
& for the opinion of his 'disciple,
I shall answer the argument I
have just heard. I will not
allow any facts or laws from
the actions of dead matter to
apply to living structures. No
blood is a living fluid: &
of this we are sure, that
it does not burn in respiration
