animal matter, which has been
called electro-positive, it may
be supposed that some electrical
function is exercised by oxygen
in the blood: - but this is a
mere hypothesis. An attempt
has been made founded on
experiments on the decomposition
of bodies by electricity to
explain secretion by weak
electrical powers & to suppose
the glands electrical organs
even to imagine the action
of the nerves dependant, upon
electricity. Those like [insertion]all[/insertion] other notions
of the same kind, appear to me
very little refined. If electrical
effects be the exhibition of certain
powers belonging to matter, which
is a fair supposition, then no
change can take place without
their being more or less concerned,
but to imagine the presence of
electricity to solve phenomena
