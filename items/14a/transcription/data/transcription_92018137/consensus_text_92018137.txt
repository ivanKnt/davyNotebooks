are entirely ignorant on this subject
& I confess in the utmost humility
my ignorance. I know there
have been distinguished physio
logists, who have imagined
that by organization, powers
not naturally possessed by
matter were developed &
that sensibility was a property
belonging to some unknown
combinations of unknown etherial
elements:- but such notions
appear to me unphilosophical
& the mere substitution of
unknown words for unknown
things. I can never believe
that any division or refinement
or subtilization or juxtaposition
or arrangement of the particles
of matter can give to them
sensibility; or that [underline]intelligence[/underline]
can result from combinations
of insensate & brute atoms.
