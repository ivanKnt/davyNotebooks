I can easily imagine that
the planets are moving by
their will or design around
the sun, or that a cannon-
ball is reasoning is making
it's parabolic curve. The
materialists have quoted a
passage of Locke in favour
of their doctrine who seemed
to doubt "whether it might
not have pleased God to
bestow a power of thinking on
matter".- But with the highest
veneration for this great reas-
oner, the founder of modern
philosophical logic, I think
there is little of his usual
strength of mind in this doubt.
It appears to me that he
might as well have asked
whether it might not have
pleased God to make a
house it's own tennant.
