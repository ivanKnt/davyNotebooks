may be called the [underline]monad[/underline] or
[underline]self[/underline] constantly present, intimate
ly associated with a particular
class of sensations which we
call our own body or organs.
These organs are connected
with other sensations &
move as it were with them
in circles of existence quitting
for a time some trains of
sensation to return to others;
but the monad is always
present, - we can fix no beg-
inning to its operations, we
can place no limit to them.
We sometimes in sleep lose
the beginning & end of a
dream & recollect the middle
of it & the dream has no
connexion with another & yet
we are conscious of an
infinite variety of dreams
