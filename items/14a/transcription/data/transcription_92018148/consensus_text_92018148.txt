The whole history of intellect
is a history of change according
to a certain law; - & we
retain the memory only
of these changes which may
be useful to us. The child
forgets what happened to
it in the womb; the recollections
of the infant likewise before
two years are soon lost,
yet many of the habits acquired
in that age are retained
thro' life. The sentient prin-
ciple gains thoughts by
material instruments & it's
sensations change as these
instruments change.- And, in
old age, the mind as it were,
falling a sleep to awake to a
new existence. With it's present
organization the intellect of
man is naturally limited
