appears improbable to me that
some of the more refined
machinery of thought may
adhere even in another state
to the sentient principle: -
for tho' the organs of gross
sensation, the nerves & brain
are destroyed by death, yet
something of the more etherial
nature which I have supposed
may be less destructible, And, 
I sometimes imagine that many
of these powers which have
been called instinctive belong
to the more refined clothing
of the spirit. Conscience indeed
seems to have some undefined
source & may bear relation
to a former state of being. -
