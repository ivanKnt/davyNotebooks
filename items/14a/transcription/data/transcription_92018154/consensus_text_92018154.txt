seed of the plant which is
not quickened till after
apparent death. And the
catastrophe of our planet
which it is revealed is to
be destroyed & purified by
fire before it is fitted
for the habitation of the blest
is in perfect harmony with
the view I have ventured
to suggest. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. - I cannot make
your notions coincide with
what I have been accustomed
to consider the meaning of
holy writ. - you allow every
thing belonging to the material
life to be dependant upon
the organization of the body
& yet you imagine the spirit
after death clothed with
a new body & in the system
of reward & punishment
