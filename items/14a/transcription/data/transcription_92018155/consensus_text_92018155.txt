95
this body is rendered happy
or miserable for actions
committed by another & an
extinct frame. A particular
organisation of the [deletion]frames[/deletion]
stomach or several organs
leads to improper & immoral
gratification; it does not
appear to me ascending to
the principles of eternal
justice that the body of the
resurrection should be
punished for crimes de-
pendant upon a conformation
now dissolved & destroyed. -
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. Nothing is
more absurd, I may say
more uniform than for man
with a ken surrounded by
the dense mists of sense,
to [underline]reason[/underline] respecting the
decrees of eternal justice.
