was always even in my youth
a cold, heavy, dull &
insupportable doctrine to me
& necessarily tending to
atheism.-
When I had heard with some
disgust in the dissecting rooms
the plan of the physiologist
of the gradual accretion of
matter & it's becoming en-
dowed with irritability
ripening into sensibility
& acquiring such organs
as were necessary by it's
own inherent forces, & at
last rising into intellectual
existence, a walk into the
green fields or woods by
the banks of rivers brought
back my feelings from
