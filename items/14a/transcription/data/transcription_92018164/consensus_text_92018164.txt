it awakens feelings of gratitude
& sublime love & purifies
at the same time that it
exalts the mind. But it is
in misfortune, in sickness,
in age, that it's effects are
most truly & beneficially
felt. When submission in
faith & humble trust in
the divine will, from duties
become pleasures, undecaying
sources of consolation. Then
it creates powers which
were believed to be extinct
& gives a freshness to the
mind which was supposed
to have passed away for ever
but which is now renovated
as an immortal hope. Then
it is the Pharos guiding the
wave tost mariner to his
home, as the calm & beautiful
