still basins or fiords sur-
rounded by tranquil groves
& pastoral meadows to the
Norwegian pilot escaping
from a heavy storm in
the North Sea: or as the
green & dewy spot gushing
with fountains to the
exhausted & thirsty traveller
in the midst of the desert.
It's influence outlives
all earthly enjoyments &
becomes stronger as the
organs decay & the frame
dissolves. It appears as
that evening star of
light in the horizon of
life which we are sure
is to become in another
season a morning star,
& it throws it's radiance
thro' the gloom & shadow
