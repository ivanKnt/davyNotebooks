almost approaches to a tale of
romance. The source of the
little information & intelligence
I possess I must refer to a
restless activity of spirit,
a love of glory, which ever
belonged to my infancy &
a sensibility easily excited
& [insertion]not[/insertion] easily conquered.
My parentage was humble,
yet I can believe a traditional
history of my [deletion]parental[/deletion] paternal grand-
mother that the origin of our
family was from an old noble
Norman stock. I found this
belief upon certain feelings
which I can only refer to an
hereditary source, a pride of
decorum, a tact & refinement
even in boyhood & which are
contradictory to the idea of
my origin from a race of
peasants.
Accident opened to me in
early youth a philosophical career
