to me in this our state of
darkness & doubt.-
[underline]Philalethes[/underline].- I am surprised
that with your powers you did
not enter into a professional
career either of law, or of
politicks; you would have
gained the highest honours
& distinctions.-
[underline]The Unknown[/underline].- To me there
never has been a higher source
of honour or distinction than
that connected with advances
in science. I have not possessed
enough of the eagle in my character
to make a direct flight to
the loftiest altitudes in the
social world;- & I certainly
never endeavoured to reach these
heights by using the creeping
powers of the reptile, who in
ascending, generally chooses the
dirtiest path because it is
the easiest.-
