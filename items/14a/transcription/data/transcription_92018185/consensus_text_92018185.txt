& experiments that these accidental
results have been rendered really
applicable to the purposes of
common life.- Besides it requires
a certain degree of knowledge
& scientific combination to
understand & seize upon the
facts which have originated
in accident.- It is certain
that in all fires, alkaline
substances & sand are fused
together & clay hardened, yet
for ages after this discovery
of fire, glass & porcelain were
unknown, till some men of
genius profited by scientific
combination often observed but
never applicable. It suits the
indolence of those minds which
never attempt any thing &
which probably if they did
attempt any thing, would not
succeed to refer to accident
