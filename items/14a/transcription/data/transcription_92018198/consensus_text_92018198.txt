not in alkali is thought by
some a foundation for chemical
celebrity. I once began to
attend a course of chemical
lectures & to read the journals
containing the ephemeral
productions of this science.
I was dissatisfied with the
nature of the evidence which
the professor adopted in
his demonstrations, & dis-
gusted with the series of
observations & experiments
which were brought forward
one month to be overturned
the next. - In November
there was a Zingerberic acid
which in January was shewn
to have no existence. One
year there was a vegetable
acid which the next was
shewn to be the same as
an acid known 30 years
