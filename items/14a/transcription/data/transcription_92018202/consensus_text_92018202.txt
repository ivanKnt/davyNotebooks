manufacturer has rarely dis-
covered anything, he has
merely applied what the
philosopher has made known;
he has merely worked upon
the materials furnished to
him. We have no history
of the manner in which iron
was rendered malleable;
but we know that platinum
could only have been worked
by a person of the most re-
fined chemical resources
who made multiplied experiments
upon it after the most ingenious
& profound views. But waving
all common utility, all
vulgar applications there
is something in knowing &
understanding the operations
of nature, - some pleasure
