true chemical philosopher sees
good in all the diversified
forms of the external world.
Whilst he investigates the
operations of infinite power
guided by infinite wisdom
all low prejudices, all mean
superstitions disappear from
his mind; he sees man an
atom amidst atoms fixed
upon a point in space &
yet modifying the laws that
around him by under-
standing them, & gaining as
it were a kind of dominion
over time & an empire in
material space & exerting on
a scale infinitely small
a power seeming a [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] sent
of shadow or reflection of
a creative energy & which
entitles him to the distinction
