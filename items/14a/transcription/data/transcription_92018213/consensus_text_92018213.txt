weights of the elements of bodies, algebra
in ascertaining the laws of the pressure
of elastic fluids, the force of vapour
as dependant upon temperature &
the effects os masses & surfaces on the
communication & radiation of heat.
The applications of geometry are
principally limited to the determination
of the crystalline forms of bodies
which constitute the most important
type of their nature & often offer
important limits for analytical
researches respecting their composition.
The first principles of natural philoso-
phy on genera≈Ç physics ought not
to be entirely unknown to the
chemist. As the most active agents
are fluids, elastic fluids, heat
light & electricity, he ought to
have a general knowledge of me-
chanicks, hydroponics, pneumatics,
optics & electricity. Latin & Greek
among the dead & French among the
modern languages are necessary &
as the most important after French,
