researches of modern chemists have
been made by means of an apparatus
which might with care be contained
in a small travelling carriage, &
the expense of which is only a few
pounds.-
The facility with which chemical
inquiries are carried on &
the simplicity of the apparatus
offer additional reasons to those
I have already given for the
pursuit of this science. It is
not injurious to the health. The
modern chemist is not like the
ancient one who passed the
greater part of his time exposed
to the heat & smoke of a furnace
& the unwholesome vapours of
acids & alkalis & other menstrua
of which for a single experiment
be considered several pounds.
His processes may be carried on
in the drawing room & some of
them are [insertion]no less[/insertion] [deletion]so[/deletion] beautiful in appearance
than satisfactory in their results.
