It was said by an author belonging
to the last century of Alchemy-
"that it's beginning was deceit,
it's prospects laborious & it's end
beggary" It may be said of
modern chemistry that it's beginning
is pleasure, it's prospects knowledge
& it's objects truth & utility-
I have spoken of the scientific
attainments necessary for the
chemical philosopher. I will say
a few words of the intellectual
qualities necessary for discovery
or for the advancement of the
science. Amongst them patience,
industry & neatness in manipulations
& accuracy & minuteness in
observing & registering the phenomena
they present are essential. A steady
hand & a quick eye are most
useful auxiliaries, but there have
been very few great chemists who
have possessed these advantages
thro' life, for the business of the
laboratory is a service of danger
