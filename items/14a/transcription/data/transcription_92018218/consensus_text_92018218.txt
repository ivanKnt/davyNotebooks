advancement in every department
of human knowledge, I need not
be very minute - The imagination
must be active & brilliant in
seeking analogies yet entirely
under the influence of the judgment
in applying them. The memory
must be extensive & profound
rather however calling up general
views of things than minute
trains of thought. The mind
must not be like an Encyclopedia
- a burthen of knowledge, but
rather a critical dictionary
which abounds in generalities &
points our where  more minute
information may be obtained -
In detailing the results of
experiments & in giving them
to the world the chemical
philosopher should adopt the
simplest style & manner;- he
will avoid all ornaments
as something injurious to his
subject & should bear in mind
