the saying of the first king of
Great Britain respecting a [underline]sermon[/underline]
which was excellent in doctrine
but overcharged with poetical
allusions & figurative language
"that the tropes & metaphors
of the speaker were like the
brilliant wild flowers in a field
of corn very pretty, but which
did very much hurt the
corn".- In announcing even
the greatest & most important
discoveries,- the true philosopher
will communicate his details
with modesty & reserve. He will
rather be a useful servant of
the public bringing forth a
light from under his cloak
when it is needed in darkness
then a charlatan exhibiting
fireworks & having a trumpeter
to announce their magnificence.
I see you are smiling & think
what I am saying is bad taste
