yet not withstanding I will provoke
your smiles still further by
saying a word or two on his
other moral qualifications.- That
he should be humble minded
you will readily allow & a
diligent searcher after truth &
neither diverted from this
great object by the love of transient
glory, or temporary popularity,-
looking rather at the opinions of
years than to that of a day &
seeking to be remembered &
named rather in the epochas of
historians, than in the columns
of newspaper-writers or journalists.
He should resemble the modern
geometricians in the greatness of
his views & the profoundness of
his researches & the ancient
alchemists in industry & piety-
I do not mean that he should
affix written prayers & inscriptions
of recommendations of his processes
