Peter Wolfe, the last of the alchem
ical school & who was alive
in my early days;- but his mind
should always be awake to
devotional feeling & in contemplating
the variety & the beauty of the
external world & in developing

always refer to that infinite
wisdom; thro' whose beneficence
he is permitted to enjoy knowledge

will become better,- he will
rise at once in the scale of
intellectual & moral existence,
his increased sagacity will
be subservient to a more exalted
faith;- & in proportion as the
veil becomes thinner thro' which
he sees the causes of things, he
will admire more the brightness
of the divine light by which they
are rendered visible.-
