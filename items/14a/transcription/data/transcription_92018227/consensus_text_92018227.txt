liable to fall , when a degradation
from chemical or mechanical
causes takes place in their inferior
parts.- The forms upon the surface
of the globe are preserved from
the influence of gravitation by
the attraction of cohesion, or by
chemical attraction, but if
their parts had freedom of
motion, they would all be
levelled by this power, gravita -
tion.- & the globe would appear
as a plain & smooth oblate
spheroid flattened at the poles.
The attraction of cohesion on
chemistry in its most energetic
state is not capable of being
destroyed by gravitation. This
power only assists the agencies
of other causes of degradation
attraction of whatever kind tends
as it were to produce rest -
a sort of eternal sleep in nature.
