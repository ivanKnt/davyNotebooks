is [underline]heat[/underline]. By the influence of the
Sun the globe is exposed to
great varieties of temperature;
an addition of heat expands
bodies & an abstraction of heat
causes them to contract. By
variations of heat certain kinds
of matter are rendered fluid
or elastic & changes from fluids
into solids, or from solids or
fluids into elastic substances
& vice versa are produced; - &
all these phenomena are con-
nected with alterations tending
to the decay or destruction of
bodies. It is not probable that
the mere contraction or expansion
of a solid from the substraction
or addition of heat tends to
loosen its' parts; but if water
exists in these parts then it's
expansion either in becoming
vapour or ice tends not only
to diminish their cohesion,
