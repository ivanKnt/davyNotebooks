may break a much harder one.
The glacier by it's motion
grinds into powder the surface
of the granite rock & the alpine
torrents that have their origin
under glaciers are always
turbid from the destruction of
the rocks on which the glacier
is formed. The effect of a torrent
in deepening it's bed will explain,
the mechanical agency of fluid
water, tho' this effect is infinitely
increased & sometimes almost
entirely dependent upon the
solid matters which are carried
down by it. An angular fragment
of stone in the course of ages
moved in the cavity of a rock
makes a deep round excavation
& is worn itself into a spherical
form. - A torrent of rain flowing
down the side of a building
carries with it the silicious
dust or sand or matter
