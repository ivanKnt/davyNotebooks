climates than in the hot ones &
most of all in those countries
where the inequalities of temperature
are greatest. The mechanical
effects of air are principally in
the action of winds in assisting
the operation of gravitation & in
abrading by dust, sand, stones &
atmospheric water. These effects

building blown down by a tempest

or unlimited duration, an extreme

is very limited: The effects of
lightning have however been
