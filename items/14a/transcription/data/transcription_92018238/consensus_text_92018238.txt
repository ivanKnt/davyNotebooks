Amongst the substances employed in
building, wood, iron, tin & lead
are most liable to decay from
the operation of water, than
marble when exposed to it's
influence in the fluid form,
brass, copper, granite, sienite
& porphyry are more durable,
but in stones, much depends
upon the peculiar nature of
their constituent parts.- When
the feldspar of the granite rocks
contains little alkali or
calcareous earth, it is a very
permanent stone, but when in
granite, porphyry, or sienite
either the feldspar contains
much alkaline matter, or
its mica, shorl, or hornblende

& carbonic acid or the ferruginous
elements tends to produce the
disintegration of the stone. The
