take place on the surface of the
globe. The chemical action of
carbonic acid is so much con-
nested with that of water as
must be evident from what
I have before said that it is
scarcely possible to speak of
them separately, but the same
action which is exerted by
the elements of the acid dissolved
in water is likewise exerted
by them in their elastic state;
& in this case the facility
with which the quantity is
changed makes up for the
difference of the degree of
condensation.- The is no reason
to believe that the azote of
the atmosphere has any con-
siderable action in producing
changes of the nature we are
studying on the surface,- the
aqueous vapour, the oxygene
& the carbonic acid gas are
however constantly in combined
