activity & above all the oxygen.
And whilst water uniting it's
effect with those of carbonic
acid tends to disintegrate the
parts of stone, the oxygen acts
upon vegetable matter. And
this great chemical agent is
at once necessary in all the
processes of life & in all those
of decay, in which nature
as it were taken again to
herself those instruments, organs
& powers which has for a while
been borrowed & employed for
the purpose or the wants of
the living principle. Almost
every thing effected by rapid
combinations in combustion may
also be effected gradually by
the slow absorption of oxygen;
& tho' the productions of the
animal & vegetable kingdom
are much more submitted to
the power of atmospheric agents
