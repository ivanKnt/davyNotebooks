nature in producing decay are
assisted likewise by certain
agencies or energies of organized
beings. A polished surface of
a building or a statue is no
sooner made rough from the
causes that have been mentioned

mosses which are constantly
floating in our atmosphere
make it a place of repose,
grow & increase & from their
death, their decay & decomposition
carbonaceous matter is produced
& at length a soil is formed in
which grass can fix it's roots.
In the crevices of walls where
this soil is washed down, even
the seeds of trees grow &
gradually as a building becomes
more ruined ivy & other
parasitical plants cover it.
