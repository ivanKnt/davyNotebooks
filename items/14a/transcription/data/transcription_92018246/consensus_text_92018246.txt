Even the animal creation lends
it's aid to the work of destruction
when man no longer labours for
the conservation of his works.
The fox burrows amongst ruins,
bats & birds nestle in the
cavities in walls, the snake
& the lizard likewise make
them their habitations. - Insects
act upon a smaller scale,
but by their united energies
sometimes produce great effect.
The ant by establishing her colony
& forming her magazines often
saps the foundation of the
strongest buildings, - & the
most insignificant creature
triumph as it were over the
the grandest works of man. Add
to these sure & slow operations
the devastations of war, the effects
of the destructive zeal of bigotry,
the predatory fury of barbarians
seeking for concealed wealth
