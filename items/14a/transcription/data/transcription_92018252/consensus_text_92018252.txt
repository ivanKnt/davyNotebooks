dews of heaven, of frost, rain
vapour & imperceptible atmospheric
influences & as the worm devours
the lineaments of his mortal
beauty, so the lichens & the
moss & the most insignificant
plants shall feed upon his
columns & [insertion]his[/insertion] pyramids: - & the
most humble & insignificant
insects shall undermine &
sap the foundations of his
colossal works, & make their
habitations amongst
ruins of his palaces & the
falling seats of his earthly
glory.-
