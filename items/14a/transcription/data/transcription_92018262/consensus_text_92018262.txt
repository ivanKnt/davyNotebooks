combinations which he has made
it his glory to form & build for
the most vain & idle purposes & many
of the glorious structures of anti-

to contain the dead & corrupting
remains & the pyramids of
Egypt, works built as it were
for eternity to prove to us only
the vain glory of some unknown
tyrant belonging to some unknown
race. - When I think of the various
effects of this faculty which you
call divine, I am put in mind
of the combinations which I
have sometimes had in the delirium
of fever when majestic edifices
appeared newly raised from
the ground amongst the ruins
of a decayed & worn out city
temples & places amidst the
clouds & a glorious colonade
ornamented with the most
beautiful statues & pictures
