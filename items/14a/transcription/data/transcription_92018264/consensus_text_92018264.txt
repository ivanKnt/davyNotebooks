& unexpected. Man is made without
clothing & no sooner has he discover
ed means of defending himself
from the external elements as
you have observed than he
instantly creates useless forms
& finery & tortured his organs
into the most uncouth shapes
to gratify certain capricious
ideas of fashion & beauty
Th first display of reason in
New South Wales is that the
savage extracts one of his
fine teeth. - In another country
the whole skin is cut & pickled
In China the women squeeze
their feet into miniature shoes
& torture themselves more than
if they went bare footed &
in England men compress
themselves in stays. Painting
the skin with noxious substances
is another effect of reason.-
