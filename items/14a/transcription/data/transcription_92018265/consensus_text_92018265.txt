Beasts fight animated by the
passion of love & the strongest
perpetuate the species. Men fight
& destroy each other without
being animated by any passion
at all but because persons
whom they support by their
labour & who never do anything
in nature quarrel about
some spot of land, or some
river, or some desert which
is of no importance whatever
to the combatants.-
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] - You are both I
thank adopting a tone of irony
too severe & sarcastic for
real philosophers & Christians
your modes or treating this
subject are similar to those
of Swift who whilst he injured
the cause of reason did not
exalt that of revelation. Even
with respect to these errors of
man which you have so strikingly
