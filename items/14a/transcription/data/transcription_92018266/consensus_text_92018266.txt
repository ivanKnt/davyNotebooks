illustrated there is a principle
which has relations to the better
& more exalted part of his
nature, & I have heard you
both deduce arguments in favour
of the immortality of the
sentient principle from our
vain aspirations from glory on
this earth & for the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of
an undying name.- Then all
distinctions have more or
less connection with [underline]this[/underline] love
of glory, & tho' it is better to
merit honours & not to
possess them than to possess
them & not to merit them,
yet still, exalted minds
will always thirst more or
less for those higher marks of
respect which must always
be valued by the multitude as
flowing from the loftiest sources
emperors & kings, the representatives
of divine majesty on Earth.-
