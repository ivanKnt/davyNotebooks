I agree with you both, that we
must wait for the end of this
terrestrial scene before we
can really judge of the nature
& objects of the characters
who have acted in the drama
of life & we may be mistaken
[deletion]sev[/deletion] even in the most probable
opinions that may be formed,
for we can know nothing of the
new scene which is to open
upon us when the curtain
falls except from revelation
but we know that it will
be a glorious scene in which
pure moral & religious natures
will be more highly exalted
- a scene in which rewards
will be bestowed according to
the decrees of eternal justice
flowing from the source of
eternal love.-
