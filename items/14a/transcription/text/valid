Dialogue 4[superscript]th[/superscript]
The Proteus
or
Immortality
The impression made
upon my mind by the
stranger with whom
we became acquainted
at Paestum was of
the strongest & most extra

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00012|dnp14a010pp|92018071[/page]
ordinary kind. The memory
of his person, his dress, his
manner, the accounts of his
voice & the tone of his
philosophy for a long
while haunted my imagin-
ation in a most unaccount
-able manner & even formed
a part of my dreams. It
often occured to me that
this was not the first
that I had seen
him & I endeavoured but
in vain to find some type
of image of him in for-
=mer scenes of my life
I continally made in
=quiries respecting him

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00013|dnp14a011pp|92018072[/page]

amongst my acquaintance,
but I could never be sure
that any of them knew
him or ever had seen him.
So great were his peculiarities
that he must have escaped
observation altogether; for
had he entered the world at
all he must have made
some noise in it. I ex-
pressed so much interest
in this subject that at
last it became a source
of ridicule amongst my
acquaintance who often
asked me if I had not yet
obtained news of my spirit
=friend or ghostseer.

After my return to Rome
in June I was almost
immediately recalled to
England by a melan-
=choly event. The death
of a very near & dear
relation & I left my two
friends Ambrosio & Onuphrio
to pursue their travels
which were intended to the
of some extent & duration.
In my youth & thro'
the prime of manhood
I never entered London
without feelings of pleasure
& hope. It was to me as
the grand theatre of intellec

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00015|dnp14a013pp|92018074[/page]
13
-tual activity, the field of
every species of enterprize
& exertion, the metropolis
of the world of business,
thought & action. There I
was sure to find the friends
& companions of my youth,
to hear the voice of encourage-
=ment & of praise. There
society of the most refined
kind offered daily its ban-
=quets to the mind, with
such variety that society
had no place in them &
new objects of interest &
ambition were constantly
exciting affection either
in politic[deletion]k[/deletion]s, litterature
or Science.

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00016|dnp14a014pp|92018075[/page]
I now entered this great
city in a very different
tone of mind - one of
settled melancholy, not
merely produced by the
mournful event which re
-called one to my country
but owing likewise to an
entire change in the
condition of my physical,
moral & intellectual being.
My health was gone,
my ambition was satis-
fied, I was no longer excited
by the desire of distinction;
what I loved most tenderly
was in the grave & to
take a metaphor derived

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00017|dnp14a015pp|92018076[/page]
15
from the change produced
by time in the juice of
the grape, my cup of life
was no longer sparkling,
sweet, & effervescent. It
had lost its sweetness without
losing its power, it was be-
-come strong, fragrant & bitter.
After passing a few
months in England enjoying
(as much as I could enjoy
anything) of the society of the
few friends who still re-
mained alive), the desire
of travel again seized me.
I had preserved amidst the
wrecks of time one feeling
strong & unbroken, the love
was no longer sparkling,

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00018|dnp14a016pp|92018077[/page]
of natural scenery; & this
in advanced life formed
a principal motive for
my plans of conduct &
action. Of all the cli-
-mates of Europe England
seems to me most fitted
for the activity of the mind
& the least suited to repose.
The alterations of a climate
so various & rapid continu-
ally awaken new sensa
tions & the changes in the
sky from dryness to moisture,
from the blue etherial to
cloudiness & fogs seem
to keep the nervous system
in a constant state of dis-

Ambience. In the mild climate
of [place]place_907|Nice[/place], Naples or Sicily
where even in winter it is
possible to enjoy the
warmth of the sunshine
in the open air, beneath
palm trees, or amidst groves
of evergreen orange trees
covered with odorous fruit &
sweetscented leaves mere
existence is a pleasure &
even the pains of disease
are sometimes forgotten
amidst the balmy influence
of nature; & a series of
agreable & uninterrupted
sensations invite to repose
& oblivion. But in the change

=ful of tumultuous atmos-
=phere of England to be
tranquil is a labour &
employment is necessary
to ward off the attacks
of ennui. The English as
a nation is preeminently
active & the natives of
no other country follow
their objects with so much
force, fire & constancy. And
as human powers are limi-
=ted there are few examples
of very distinguished men
living in this country to old age.
They usually fail, droop &
die before they have attained
the period naturally marked

sophers often abundant
[deletion]truths of[/deletion] proof of the
truth of this opinion.
whatever burns consumes
ashes remain. Before the
period of youth is passed
grey hairs usually cover
those brows which are adorned
with the civic oak or the
laurel, & in the luxurious
& exciting life of the man
of pleasure their tints are
not even preserved by the
myrtle wealth or the
garland of roses from the
premature winter of time.

In selecting the scenes
for my new journey I was
guided by my former ex=
-perience. I know no country
more beautiful than that
which may be called the
Alpine country of [place]place_201|Austria[/place] 
including the alps of the
southern Tyrol, those of
Illyria, the Noric & the
Julian Alps, & the alps
of Styria & Salzburg. The
variety of the scenery the
verdure of the meadows
& trees, the depths of the
vallies, the altitude of the
mountains, the clearness
& grandeur of the rivers
& lakes give it I think a

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00023|dnp14a021pp|92018082[/page]
21
decided superiority over
Switzerland; & the people
are far more agreable -
various in their costumes &
manners. Illyrians, Italians
or Germans, they have all
the same simplicity of
character & are all distinguish
-ed by their love of their
country, their devotion to their
sovereign, the warmth &
purity of their faith,
their honesty, & (with very
few exceptions) I may
say their great civiliity &
courtesy to strangers.
In the prime of life
I had visited this region
in a society which affor
-ded one the pleasures of

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00024|dnp14a022pp|92018083[/page]
intellectual friendship & the delights
of refinest affection. Later I had
left he burning summer of Italy
& the violence of an unhealthy passion
& had found coolness, shade, repose
& tranquility there. In a still
more advanced period I had
sought for & found consolation &
partly recovered my health after
a dangerous illness in consequence
of Labour & mental agitation.
There I had found the spirit
of my early vision. I was desirous
therefore of again passing some
time in these scenes in the hope
of reestablishing a broken constitution
& tho' this hope was a feeble one
yet at least I expected to spend
a few of the last days of life more
tranquilly & more agreeably than
in the Metropolis of my own country
Nature never deceives us, the
rocks, the mountains, the streams,
always speak the same language;

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00025|dnp14a023pp|92018084[/page]

a shower of snow may hide the
vendant woods in spring, - a
thunder storm may render the
blue limpid streams foul &
turbulent; - but these effects
are rare & transcient. In a
few hours, and at most days, all
the sources of beauty are re-
novated; & nature affords no
continued trains of misfortunes
& miseries such as depend upon
the constitution of humanity, - no
hopes for ever blighted in the
bud, no beings full of life
beauty & promise taken from
us in the prime of youth.
Her fruits are all balmy
light & sweet; she affords
none of these blighted ones so
common in the life of man &
so like the fabled apples of
the dead sea fresh & beautiful
to the sight, but when tasted

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00026|dnp14a024pp|92018085[/page]
full of bitterness & ashes. I have
already mentioned the strong effect
produced on my mind by the
stranger whom I had met so
accidentally at Paestum; the
hope of seeing him again was
another of my motives for wishing
to leave England & (why I
know not) I had a decided
presentiment that I was more
likely to meet him in the
[place]place_1404|Austrian States[/place] than elsewhere
even than in England his own
country. -
In this journey I had one com-
panion an early friend & med-
ical advisor. He had lived
much in the world, had acquired
a considerable fortune, had given
up his profession, was now re-
tired & sought like myself in
this journey repose [insertion]of mind[/insertion] & the pleasures
derived from natural scenery.
He was a man of a very powerful

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00027|dnp14a025pp|92018086[/page]
25
& acute understanding; but had
less of the poetical temperament
than any person whom I had
even known with similar viva-
city of mind. He was a severe
thinker, with great variety of
information, an excellent
physiologist & an accomplisted
naturalist. In his reasonings he
adopted the precision of a
geometer & was always upon his
guard against the influence of
imagination. He had passed the
meridian of life & his health
was weak like my own, so that
we were well suited as
travelling companions, moving
always slowly from place to
place without having a fatigue.
I shall call this friend Eubathes
I will say nothing of the progress
of our journey thro' France &
Germany. I shall dwell only
upon that point of it which
has still a strong interest

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00028|dnp14a026pp|92018087[/page]
for me & where events occured
that I shall never forget. We
passed into the Alpine country
of [place]place_201|Austria[/place] by Lintz on the
Danube & followed the course
of the Traun to Gmunden on
the Traun see or lake of the
Traun when we [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]halted[/insertion] for some
days. If I were disposed to
indulge in minute picturesque
descriptions I might occupy
hours with details of the various
characters of the enchanting
scenery in this neighbourhood.
The vales have that pastoral
beauty & constant verdure
which is so familiar to us
in England, with similar
enclosures & hedgerows  & fruit
& forest trees. Above are noble
hills planted with beeches &
oaks. Mountains bound the
view, here covered with pines

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00029|dnp14a027pp|92018088[/page]
27
& larches, - there raising their
marble crests capped with
eternal snows above the clouds.
The lower part of the Traun
see is always even in the
most rainy season perfectly
pellucid & the Traun pours
out of it over ledges of rocks
a large & magnificient river
beautifully clear & of the
purest tint of the bough. The
fall of the Traun about ten
miles below Gmunden was
one of our favourite haunts
It is a cataract, which when the
river is full, may be almost
compared to that of Schaffhausen
in magnitude; & possess the
same peculiar character of
grandeur in the precipitous rush
of it's awful & overpowering
waters & of beauty in the
tint of its streams & foam
& in the forms of the rocks

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00030|dnp14a028pp|92018089[/page]
over which it falls & the cliffs
& woods by which it is overhung.
- In this spot an accident
which had nearly been fatal
to me, occasioned the renewal
of my acquaintance in an
extraordinary manner with the
mysterious unknown stranger.
Eubathes who was very fond
of fly-fishing was amusing
himself by catching graylings
for our dinner in the stream
above the fall. I took one of
the boats which are used for
descending the canal or lock
artificially cut in the rock by
the side of the fall, on which
salt & wood are usually
transported from Upper Austria
to the Danube, & I desired
two of the peasants to assist
my servant in permitting the
boat to descend by a rope

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00031|dnp14a029pp|92018090[/page]
29
to this curl of the river below.
My intention was to amuse
myself by this rapid species
of locomotion along the descending
sluice. In some moments the
the boat glided gently along
the smooth current & I enjoyed
the beauty of the moving scene
around me & had my eye
fixed upon the bright rain-
bow seen upon the spray of
the cataract above my head
when I was suddenly aroused
by a shout of alarm from
my servant & looking round
I saw that the piece of wood
to which the rope had been
attached had given way &
the boat was floating down
the river at the mercy of
the stream. I was not at first
alarmed, for I saw that my
assistants were procuring long
poles with which it appeared

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00032|dnp14a030pp|92018091[/page]
easy to arrest the boat before
it entered the rapidly descending
water of the sluice; & I called
out to them to use their united
force to reach the longest pole
accross the water that I might
be stable to catch the end of
it in my hand, & at this
moment I felt perfect security
but a breeze of wind suddenly
came over the valley & blew
from the nearest bank, the
boat was turned by it out
of the side current & thrown
nearer to the middle of the
river & I soon saw that I
was likely to be precipitated
over the cataract. My servant
& the boatman rushed into
the water; but it was too deep
to enable them to reach the
boat. I was soon in the white
water of the descending stream
& my danger was inevitable

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00033|dnp14a031pp|92018092[/page]
31
I had presence of mind maybe
to consider whether my chance
of safety would be greater
by throwing myself out of the
boat or by remaining in it
& I preferred the latter ex-
pedient. I looked [deletion]upon[/deletion] [insertion]from[/insertion] the
rainbow upon the bright sun
above my head as if taking
leave for ever of that glorious
luminary. I raised one pious
aspiration to the divine power
of light & life, I was im-
mediately stunned by the
thunder of the fall & my eyes
were closed in darkness.
How long I remained insensible
I know not. My first recollections
after this accident were of a
bright light shining above me
of warmth & pressure in
different parts of my body &
of the noise of the rushing

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00034|dnp14a032pp|92018093[/page]
cataract sounding in in my ears.
I seemed awakened by the
light from a sound sleep &
endeavoured to recall my
scattered thoughts, but in
vain. I soon fell again
into slumber. From this second
sleep I was awakened by a
voice which seemed not
altogether unknown to me, &
looking upwards I saw the
bright eye & noble countenance
of the unknown stranger whom
I had met at [place]place_180|Paestum[/place].
I faintly articulated "I am
in another world" - No, said
the stranger, you are safe in
this. You are a little bruised
by your fall, but you will
soon be well. Be tranquil
& compose yourself, - your
friend is here & you will

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00035|dnp14a033pp|92018094[/page]
33
want no other assistance than
he can easily give you. He
then took one of my hands
& I recognised the same strong
& warm pressure which I
had felt from his parting
salute at Paestum. Euthabes
whom I saw now with an
expression of joy & of warmth
unusual to him, gave a
hearty shake to the other hand
& they both said "you must
repose a few hours longer"
after a sound sleep till
the evening I was able to
take some refreshment &
found little inconvenience from
the accident except some
bruises in the lower part of
the body & a slight swimming
in the head. The next day
I was able to return

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00036|dnp14a034pp|92018095[/page]
[deletion]return[/deletion] to Gmunden where I
learnt from the unknown the
history of my escape which
seemed almost miraculous to
me. He said, that he was
often in the habit of combining
pursuits of natural history
with the amusements derived from
rural sports; - & was fishing
the day that my accident hap-
pened below the fall of the
Traun for that peculiar species
of the large salmo of the
Danube which fortunately for
me is only to be caught
by very strong tackle; he
saw to his very grat astonish-
ment & alarm the boat &
my body in it precipitated
by the fall. He was so for-
fortunate as to entangle his
hooks in a part of my dress
when I had been scarcely
more than a minute under

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00037|dnp14a035pp|92018096[/page]
35
water & by the assistance of his
servant who was armed with
the gaff or curved hook for
landing large fish I was
safely conveyed to the shore
undressed, put into a warm
bed & by the modes of res
storing suspended animation
which was familiar to
him I soon recovered my
sensibility & consciousness.
I was desirous of reasoning
with him & Eubathes upon
the state of annihilation of
power & transient death
which I had suffered when
in the water, but they both
requested me to defer those
inquiries which required too
profound an exertion of
thought till the effects of the
shock on my weak constitution
were over & my strength was

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00038|dnp14a036pp|92018097[/page]
somewhat reestablished, & I
was the more contented to
comply with their request as
the unknown said it was
his intention to be our com-
panion for at least some
days longer & that his objects
of pursuit lay in the very country
in which we were making
our summer tour. It was some
weeks before I was sufficiently
strong to proceed on our journey
for my frame was little [insertion]fitted[/insertion] to
bear such a trial as that
to which it had been sub-
mitted: & [deletion]I[/deletion] considering the
weak state of my body when
I was immerged in the water
I could hardly avoid regarding
my recovery as providential
& the presence & assistance of
the stranger as in some way

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00039|dnp14a037pp|92018098[/page]
37
connected with the future destiny
& utility of my life. In the
middle of August we pursued
our plans of travel. We first
visited those romantick
lakes Hallsstadt, Ausee &
Töplitzsee which collect the
melted snows of the higher
mountains of Styria to supply
the unfailing sources of the
Traun. We visited that elevated
region of the Tyrol which
forms the west of the Puster-
thal & whence the same chain
of glaciers send down streams
to the Drave & the Adige,
to the Black sea & the Adriatic
We remained for many days
in those too magnificent vallies
which afford the sources of the
Sava whence that glorious &
abundant river rises as it

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00040|dnp14a038pp|92018099[/page]
were in the very bosom of
beauty, leaping from its
subterraneous reservoirs in
the snowy mountains of
Terglou & Manhardt in
thundering cataracts amongst
cliffs & woods, into the
pure & deept cerulean
lakes of Wochain & Wurzen
& pursuing it's course
amidst pastoral meadows
so ornamental with plants
& trees as to look the garden
of nature.
The subsoil or strata of this
part of Illyria are entirely
calcerous & full of subterranean
caverns so that in every declivity
large funnel shaped cavities
like the craters of volcanos may
be seen in which the waters
that fall from the atmosphere

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00041|dnp14a039pp|92018100[/page]
39
are lost; & almost every lake
in view has a subterraneous
source & often a subterraneous
exit. The Laibach river rises
twice from the Limestone rock
& is twice again swallowed
up by the earth before it
makes it's final appearance
& is lost in the Sava. The Zirknitz
see or lake is a mass of 
water entirely filled & emptied
by subterraneous sources &
it's natural history tho' singular
has [insertion]in it[/insertion] nothing of either prodigy
mystery or wonder. The grotto
of the Maddalena at Adelsburg 
occupied more of our attention
than the Zirknitz See. I shall
give the conversation that
took place in that extraordinary
cavern entire as well as I
can remember it in the words
used by my companions. -

[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] We must be many hundred 
feet below the surface yet the
temperature of this cavern is
fresh & agreeable.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. - This cavern has
the mean temperature of the
atmosphere which is the case with
all subterranean cavities re-
moved from the influence of
the solar light & heat; - & in so
hot a day in August as this,
I know no more agreeable or
salutary manner of taking
a cold bath than in descending
to a part of the atmosphere out
of the influence of those causes
which occasion it's elevated
temperature. -
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] Have you sir, been
in this country before?.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. - This is the third
summer that I have made it
the scene of an annual visit.

41
Independently of the natural beauties
found in Illyria & the various
sources of amusement which
a traveller fond of natural
history may find in this region
it has had a peculiar object
of interest for me, are the
extraordinary animals which
are found in the bottom of
it's subterranean cavities. I
allude to the Proteus Anguinus
a far greater wonder of nature 
than any of those which the
Baron Valvasor [otherwork]otherwork_284|detailed[/otherwork] to
the Royal Society a century &
half ago as belonging to
Carniola, with far too rom
antic an air for a philosopher
[underline]Philalethes.[/underline] - I have seen these
animals in passing through this
country before, but I should be
very glad to be better aquainted
with this natural history.

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00044|dnp14a042pp|92018103[/page]
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] We shall soon be
in that part of the grotto where
they are found; & I shall
willingly communicate the little
that I have been able to learn
inspecting their natural characters
& habits. -
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] The grotto now becomes
really magnificent. I have seen
no subterraneous cavity with
so many traits of beauty &
of grandeur. The irregularity
of its surface, the magnitude
of the masses broken in pieces
which compose it's sides &
which seem torn from the
bosom of the mountain by some
great conventions of nature
their dark colours & deep
shades form a singular
contrast with the beauty, uniform-
ity, I may say order, &
of the white stalactical concretions
which hang from the canopy

above & where the light of our
torches reflected from the
brilliant or transparent calcareous
gems create a scene which
almost looks like one produced
by enchantment. -
[underline]Philathetes[/underline]. - If the awful
chasms of dark masses of rock
surrounding us appear like
the work of demons, who
might be imagined to have
risen from the centre of the
Earth; the beautiful works of
nature above our heads may
be compared to a scenic re-
presentation of a temple or
banquet hall for Faeries or
genii, such as those fabled
in the Arabian Romances. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. - A poet might
certainly place here, the palace
of the King of Gnomes &
might find marks of his creative
power in the small lake beneath

our feet on which the flame of
the torch is now falling. For
there it is that I expect to
find the extraordinary animals
which have been so long the
objects of my attention. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] - I see three or
four creatures like slender fishes
moving on the mud below the
water. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. I see them: they
are the Protei. Now I have them
in my fishing net & now they
are safe in the pitcher of water.
At first view you might suppose
this Animal to be a lizard;
but it has the motions of a
fish. Its' head & the lower part
of its' body & its' tail bear
a strong resemblance to those of
the eel; but it has no fins,
& it's curious bronchial organs,
are not like the gills of fishes:
but they form a singular

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00047|dnp14a045pp|92018106[/page]
45
vascular structure, as you see,
almost like a crest round the
throat. They may be removed
without occasioning the death
of the animal, who is likewise
furnished with lungs. With
this double apparatus for
supplying air to the blood, it
can live either below or
above the surface of the water.
It's fine feet resemble hands,
but they have only three claws
or fingers & are too feeble
to be of use in grasping or
supporting the weight of the
animal: the hinder feet have
only two claws or toes & in
the larger specimens are
found so imperfect as to be
almost obliterated. It has small
points in place of eyes, as
if to preserve the analogy of
nature. It is of a fleshy white

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00048|dnp14a046pp|92018107[/page]
ness, & transparency in it's natural
state, but when exposed to
light it's skin gradually becomes
darker & at last gains an
olive tint: it's nasal organ,
appears large & it is abundantly
furnished with teeth, from
which it may be concluded,
that it is an animal of
prey, yet in it's confined state
it has never been known to
eat & it has been kept alive
for many years by occasionally
changing the water in which
it was placed.
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. Is this the only place
in Carniola where these animals
are found? -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person] - They were first
discovered here by the late
[person]person_1119|Baron Zoïs[/person]; but they have since
been found tho' mainly at
Sittich about 30 miles distant

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00049|dnp14a047pp|92018108[/page]
47
thrown up by water from a
subterranean cavity, & I have
lately heard it reported that
some individuals of the same
species have been recognized
in the calcareous strata in
Sicily. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] - This lake in which
we have seen these animals
is a very small one; do you
suppose they are bred here?
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person] - Certainly not
In dry seasons, they are seldom
found here; but after great
rains they are often abundant
& I think it cannot be doubted
that their natural residence is
in an extensive deep sub-
terranean lake from which
in great floods they sometimes
are forced thro' the crevices
of the rocks into this place
where they are found; - & it

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00050|dnp14a048pp|92018109[/page]
does not appear to me impossible
when the peculiar nature of the
country in which we are is
considered, that the same great
cavity may furnish the in-
dividuals which have been found
at Adelsberg & at Sittich. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] - This is a very ex-
traordinary view of the Subject:
is it not possible that it may
be the larva of some large
unknown Animal inhabiting
these limestone cavities - Its
feet are not in harmony
with the rest of it's organization
& were they removed it would
have all the characters of a
fish. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person] - I cannot suppose
that they are larvae: there is
I believe in nature no instance
of a transition by this species
of metamorphosis, from a more

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00051|dnp14a049pp|92018110[/page]
49
perfect to a less perfect animal.
The tadpole has a resemblance to a
fish before it becomes a frog; the
caterpillar & the maggot gain not
only more perfect powers of motion
on the earth in their new state,
but acquire organs by which they
inhabit a new element. This animal
I dare say is much larger than
we now see it, when mature in
it's native place; but it's comparative
anatomy is exceedingly hostile to
the idea, that it is an animal
in a state of transition. It has
been found of various sizes from
that of the thickness of a quill to
that of the thumb; but it's form
of organs has been always the
same. It is scarcely a perfect
animal of a peculiar species &
it adds one instance more to the
number already known of the
wonderful manner in which life
is produced & perpetuated in
every part of our Globe; even in

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00052|dnp14a050pp|92018111[/page]
places which seem the least suited
to organized existences. And the
same infinite power & wisdom
which has fitted the Camel &
the ostrict for the deserts of
Africa, the swallow that secretes
its' own nest for the caves of Java,
the whale for the polar seas,
& the moose & white bear for
the [place]place_1426|Arctic[/place] ice, has given the
Proteus to the deep & dark sub-
terraneous lakes of Illyria,
an animal to whom the presence
of light is not essential & who
can live indifferently in air
& in water, on the surface of
the rock or in the depths of
mud. -
[underline]Philalethes[/underline] - It is now two years
since I first visited this spot.
I was exceeding anxious to see
the Proteus & came here with the
guide in the evening of the
day I arrived at Adelsberg
but tho' we examined the

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00053|dnp14a051pp|92018112[/page]
51
bottom of the cave with the greatest
care, we could find no specimens;
We returned the next morning
& were more fortunate, for we
discovered five close to the
bank on the mud covering the
bottom of the lake. The mud
was smooth & perfectly undistur
bed & the water quite clear.
This fact of their appearance
during the night seemed to me
so extraordinary that I could
hardly avoid the fancy that
they were new creations. I saw
no cavities thro' which they
could have entered, & the
undisturbed state of the lake
seemed to give weight to
my notion: my reveries
became discursive; I was carried
in imagination back to the
primitive state of the globe,
when the great animals of the
sauri kind were created under

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00054|dnp14a052pp|92018113[/page]
the perfume of a heavy atmosphere
& my emotion on this subject was
not destroyed when I heard from
a celebrated anatomist to whom
I sent the specimens I had
collected, that the organization
of the species of the Proteus was
analogous to that of one of the
sauri, the remains of which
are found in the other secondary
strata. It was said at this
time that no generative organs
had been discovered in any
of the specimens examined
by physiologists & this lent a
weight to my opinion of the
possibility of their being actually
new creations; which I suppose
you will condemn as wholly
visionary & unphilosophical
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] - From the tone in
which you make your statement
I think you yourself consider them

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00055|dnp14a053pp|92018114[/page]
53
as unworthy of discussion: on such
ground eels might be considered
as new creations for their mature
ovaria have not yet been 
discovered & they come from
the sea into rivers under
circumstances when it is difficult
to trace their course. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. - the problem of
the generation of the Proteus like
that of the common eel is not
yet solved: but ovaria have
been discovered in animals of
both species, & in this instance
as in all others belonging to
the existing order of things
Harvey's maxim of "omne 
vivum ab ovo" will apply.
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] - you just now said
that this animal has been long
an object of attention to you. Have
you studied it as a comparative
anatomist in search of the solution
of the problem of it's generation?

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00056|dnp14a054pp|92018115[/page]
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] - no - this inquiry
has been pursued by more
able investigators, by [person]person_965|Schreiber[/person]
& [person]person_1120|Confligliachi[/person]. My researches
were made upon it's respiration
& the changes occasional in
water by it's branchiae. -
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] - I hope they have been
satisfactory. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] - The proved to me
at least that not merely the
oxygen dissolved in water but
likewise a part of the azote was
absorbed in the respiration of
this animal.
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] - So that your re-
searches confirm those of the
french savans & Alexander
von Humboldt, that in the re-
piration of animals that se-
perate air from water, both
principles of this atmosphere
are absorbed.
[underline]Philalethes[/underline] - I have heard so many

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00057|dnp14a055pp|92018116[/page]
55
& such various opinions on the
nature of the function of information
during my education, & since,
that I would like to know
what is the modern doctrine
on this subject. - I can hardly
refer to better authority
than yourself; & I have an
additional reason for wishing
for some accurate knowledge
on this matter, having as
you will know been the
subject of an experiment in
relation to it, which but
for your kind & active
assistance might have been
wounded fatally.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- I shall gladly
state what I know, which is very
little. In physics & in chemistry
the science of dead matter, we
possess many facts & a few
principles or laws, but whenever

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00058|dnp14a056pp|92018117[/page]
the functions of life are [deletion]considered[/deletion]
considered tho' the facts are num
erous yet there is as yet scarcely
an approach to general laws
and we must usually end where
we begin by confessing our
entire ignorance. -
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] - I will not allow this
ignorance to be entire. Something
undoubtedly has been gained by
the knowledge of the circulation
of the blood and it's aeration in
the lungs. Here if not laws, are
at least fundamental principles-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] - I speak only of the
functions in their connexion with
life. We are still ignorant of
the source of animal heat tho'
half a century ago the chemists
thought they had proved it was
owing to a sort of combustion
of the carbon of the blood.-
[underline]Philalethes.[/underline] - As we return to
our Inn, I hope you will both
be so good as to give me your

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00059|dnp14a057pp|92018119[/page]
57
your views of the nature of this
function so important to all
living being. Tell me what
you [underline]know[/underline], or what you [underline]believe[/underline]
or what others [underline]imagine[/underline] [underline]they[/underline]
[underline]know[/underline].-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. - The powers of [insertion]the[/insertion]
organic system depend upon
a continual state of change.
The waste of the body produced
in muscular action, perspiration
& various sensations, is made up
for by the constant supply of
nutritious matter to the blood
by the absorbents; And, by the
action of the heart the blood is
preserved in perpetual motion
through every part of the body.
In the lungs or bronchia the
venous blood is exposed to the
influence of air & undergoes
a remarkable change, being
converted into arterial blood.
The obvious chemical alteration

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00060|dnp14a058pp|92018120[/page]
of the air is sufficiently simple
in this process: a certain quantity
of [deletion]carbonic acid[/deletion] carbon only
is added to it & it receives,
an addition of heat & vapour.
The volumes of elastic fluid
inspired & expired (making
allowance for change of temperature)
are the same & if ponderable
agents only were to be regarded
it would appear as if the
only use of respiration were
to force the blood from a certain
quantity of carbonaceous matter;
but it is probable that this
is only a secondary object
& that the change produced by
respiration upon the blood is
of a much more important
kind - Oxygen in its elastic
state has properties which are
very characteristic; it gives out

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00061|dnp14a059pp|92018121[/page]
59
light by compression, which is not
certainly known to be the case
with any other elastic fluids
except those with which oxygen
has entered without undergoing
combustion and from the fire it
produces in certain processes &
from the manner in which
it is separated by positive
electricity in the gaseous state
from it's combinations, it is
not easy to avoid the sup-
position, that it contains
besides it's ponderable element
some very subtile matter
which is capable of assuming
the form of heat & light. [underline]My[/underline]
[underline]idea[/underline] is that the common air
inspired enters into the venous
blood entire in a state of
dissolution carrying with it it's
subtile or etherial part,

[page]62|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00062|dnp14a060pp|92018122[/page]
which in ordinary cases of
chemical change is given off; that
it expels from the blood carbonic
acid gas & Azote; & that in
the course of the circulation its
chemical part & it's ponderable
part undergo changes which
belong to laws that can not
be considered as chemical;
the etherial part probably
producing animal heat & other
effects; & the ponderable part
contributing to form carbonic
acid & other products. The
arterial blood is necessary to
all the functions of life; &
it is the less connected with
the irritability of the muscles &
the sensibility of the nerves
than with the performance of
all the secretions. -
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline]. No one can be more
fully convinced than I am, of
the very limited extent of our

[page]63|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00063|dnp14a061pp|92018123[/page]
61
knowledge in chemical physiology, &
when I say that having been in
principle a friend of D[superscript]r,[/superscript] Black, I
am still disposed to prefer his
ancient view to your new one. I
wish merely to induce you to
pause & to hear my reasons:
They may appear insufficient to
you, but I am anxious to ex-
plain them. First, then, in all
known chemical changes in which
oxygen gas is absorbed & carbonic
acid gas formed, heat is produced
I could mention a thousand
instances from the contribution of
wood, or spirits of wine, to the 
fermentation of fruit, or the
putrefaction of animal matter:
This general fact which may
be almost called a law, is in
favour of the view of [person]person_231|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black[/person]. 
Another circumstance in favour
of it, is, that those animals
which possess the highest temperature

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00064|dnp14a062pp|92018124[/page]
consume the greatest quantity
of air: and, under different cir-
cumstances of action or repose the
heat is in great measure pro-
portional to the quantity of oxygen
consumed. - Then those animals
which absorb the smallest quantity
of air are cold blooded. Another
argument in favour of [person]person_231|D[superscript]r.[/superscript] Black's[/person]
opinion is, the change of colour
of blood from black to red,
which seems to show that it
loses carbon.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] With the highest
respect for the memory of D[superscript]r.[/superscript] Black
& for the opinion of his 'disciple,
I shall answer the argument I
have just heard. I will not
allow any facts or laws from
the actions of dead matter to
apply to living structures. No
blood is a living fluid: &
of this we are sure, that
it does not burn in respiration

[page]65|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00065|dnp14a063pp|92018125[/page]
63
The terms warmth & cold [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion]
applied to the blood of animals
are improper, in the sense in
which they have been just used,
all animals are in fact warm
blooded, & the degrees of their
temperature are fitted to their
circumstances under which they
live &, those animals, the
life of which is most active
possess most heat; which may
be the result of general actions
& not a particular effect of
respiration. Besides a distinguis
hed physiologist has rendered
it probable, that the animal
heat depends more upon the
functions of the nerves, than
upon any result of respiration.
The argument derived from
the change of colour, is perfectly
delusive. It would not follow
if carbon were liberated from
the blood that it must necessarily

[page]66|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00066|dnp14a064pp|92018126[/page]
become brighter; sulphur combining
with charcoal becomes a clear
fluid & a black oxide of copper
becomes red in uniting with
a substance which abounds in carbon.
No change in sensible qualities
can ever indicate with precision
the nature of a chemical change.
I shall resume my view, which
I cannot be said to have fully
developed. When I stated that
carbonic acid was formed in the 
venous blood in the process of
life, I meant mainly to say,
that this blood in consequence 
of certain changes become
capable of giving off carbon
& oxygen in union with each
other; - for the moment inorganic
matter enters into the composition
living organs it obeys new
laws. The action of the gastric
juice is chemical & it will
only dissolve dead matters, &

[page]67|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00067|dnp14a065pp|92018127[/page]
65
it dissolves [underline]them[/underline] when they are in
tubes of metal as well as in
the stomach, but it has no action
upon living matter. Respiration
is no more a chemical process
than the absorption of chyle: &
the changes that take place in
the lungs tho' they appear so
simple, may be very complicated.
It is as little philosophical to
consider them as a mere com-
bustion of carbon, as to consider
the formation of muscle from
the arterial blood as crystallization
There can be no doubt that all
the power & agencies, of matter
are employed in the purposes
of organization; but the phenomena
of organization can, no [deletion]more[/deletion] be
referred to chemistry than those
of chemistry to mechanicks. As
oxygen stands as that electrical
relation to ten other elements of

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00068|dnp14a066pp|92018128[/page]
animal matter, which has been
called electro-positive, it may
be supposed that some electrical
function is exercised by oxygen
in the blood: - but this is a
mere hypothesis. An attempt
has been made founded on
experiments on the decomposition
of bodies by electricity to
explain secretion by weak
electrical powers & to suppose
the glands electrical organs
even to imagine the action
of the nerves dependant, upon
electricity. Those like [insertion]all[/insertion] other notions
of the same kind, appear to me
very little refined. If electrical
effects be the exhibition of certain
powers belonging to matter, which
is a fair supposition, then no
change can take place without
their being more or less concerned,
but to imagine the presence of
electricity to solve phenomena

[page]69|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00069|dnp14a067pp|92018129[/page]
67
the cause of which is unknown, is
merely to substitute one undefined
word for another. In some
animals electrical organs are
found, but then they furnish the
artillery of the animal & means
of seizing it's prey & of it's
defence: and, speculations of
this kind must be ranked with
those belonging to some of the
more superficial followers of
the Newtonian philosophy, who
explained the properties of
animated nature by mechanical
power & muscular action by
the expansion & contraction of
elastic bladders. Man in this
state of vague philosophical
inquiry was supposed a species
of hydraulic machine: And,
when the pneumatic chemistry
was invented, organic structures
were soon imagined to be
laboratories in which combinations

[page]70|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00070|dnp14a068pp|92018130[/page]
& decompositions produced all the
effects of living action: these
muscular contractions were
supposed to depend upon explosions
like those of the detonating com-
pounds; & the formation of blood
from chyle was considered as
a pure chemical solution. And
now that the progress of science
has opened new & extraordinary
views in electricity, these
views are not unnaturally
applied by speculative reasoners
to solve some of the mysterious
& recondite phenomena of
organized beings; - but the
analogy is too remote &
incorrect;- the sources of life
cannot be grasped by such
machinery: - to look for them
in the powers of electro-chemistry
is seeking the living among the
dead. That which touches, will
not be felt;- that which sees

[page]71|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00071|dnp14a069pp|92018131[/page]
69
will not be visible, that which
commands sensations will not
be their subject. -
[underline]Philalethes[/underline]. - I conclude from what
you last said, that tho' you are
inclined to believe that some
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] unknown, subtile matter
is added to the organized system
by respiration, yet you would
not have us believe that this
is electricity, or that there is
any reason to suppose that
electricity has a peculiar &
special share in producing the
functions of life.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] I wish to stand
you against the adoption of any
hypothesis on this recondite &
abstruse subject; - but however
difficult it may be to define
the exact nature of respiration,
yet the effect of it & its com-
nexions with the functions of the
body are sufficiently striking.

[page]72|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00072|dnp14a070pp|92018132[/page]
By the action of air on the blood
It is fitted for the purposes of
life, & from the moment that
animation is marked by sensation
or volition this function is per-
formed. The punctum saliens
in the ocean seems to receive
as it were the breath of
life in the influence of air.
In the economy of generation,
one f the most important cir-
cumstances is the aeration of
the ovum & when this is
not performed from the
blood of the mother as is the
mammalia by the placenta,
there is a system for aerating
as in the oviparous reptiles or
fishes which enables the air
freely to pass thro' the receptacles
in which the eggs are deposited;
or, the egg itself is aerated out
of the body tho' it's coats or

[page]73|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00073|dnp14a071pp|92018133[/page]
71
shell: & when air is excluded,
circulation or artificial heat
has no effect. Fishes which deposit
their eggs in water that contains
only a limited portion of air
make combinations which would
seem almost the result of
scientific knowledge or reason,
tho' depending upon a more
unerving principle their instinct
for preserving their offspring.
Those fishes that spawn in
spring on the beginning of
summer, & which inhabit deep
& still waters, as the carp,
bream, pike, tench, &c
deposit their eggs upon aquatic
vegetables, which by the influence
of the solar light constantly
preserve the water in a state
of aeration. The trout, salmon
huncho & others of the Salmo
genus which spawn in the

[page]74|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00074|dnp14a072pp|92018134[/page]
beginning or end of winter &
which inhabit rivers first by
cold & rapid streams which
descend from the mountains
deposit their eggs in shallows
on heaps of gravel, as near as
possible to the source of the
stream where the water is
fully combined with air; &
to accomplish this purpose
they travel for hundreds of
miles against the current,
& leap over cataracts & dams
Thus the Salmo Salar ascends
by the Rhine & the [place]place_1412|Aar[/place] to
the glaciers of Switzerland
the Hucho by the Danube, the
Ivar & the Save passing
thro' the lakes of the Tyrol &
Styria to the highest torrents
of the Noric & Julian Alps.
[underline]Philalethes[/underline]. My own experience
proves in the strongest manner
the immediate connexion of

[page]75|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00075|dnp14a073pp|92018135[/page]
73
sensibility with respiration. All
that I can remember in my
accident was a certain violent
& painful sensation of oppression
in the chest, which must have
been imeediately succeeded
by loss of sense. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. I have no doubt
that all your suffering was
over at the moment you
describe as far as sensibility
is concerned, you were in-
animate when your friend
raised you from the bottom.
This distinct connexion of
sensibility with the absorption
of air by the blood, is I think
in favour of the idea advanced
by our friend, that some subtile
& etherial matter is supplied
to the system in the elastic
air which may be the cause
of vitality. -

[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. -Softly, if you
please. I must not allow you
to mistake my view. I think
it probable that some subtile
matter is derived from
the atmosphere connected with
the functions of life; but
nothing can be more remote
from my opinion than to
suppose it the cause of
vitality.
[underline]Philalethes[/underline]. This might have
been fully inferred from the
whole tenour of your conver-
sation & particularly from
that expression, "that which
commands sensation will
not be their subject". I think
I shall not mistake your
views when I say that you do
not think vitality dependant
upon any material cause or
principle.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. You do not. We

[page]77|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00077|dnp14a075pp|92018137[/page]
75
are entirely ignorant on this subject
& I confess in the utmost humility
my ignorance. I know there
have been distinguished physio
logists, who have imagined
that by organization, powers
not naturally possessed by
matter were developed &
that sensibility was a property
belonging to some unknown
combinations of unknown etherial
elements:- but such notions
appear to me unphilosophical
& the mere substitution of
unknown words for unknown
things. I can never believe
that any division or refinement
or subtilization or juxtaposition
or arrangement of the particles
of matter can give to them
sensibility; or that [underline]intelligence[/underline]
can result from combinations
of insensate & brute atoms.

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00078|dnp14a078pp|92018138[/page]
I can easily imagine that
the planets are moving by
their will or design around
the sun, or that a cannon-
ball is reasoning is making
it's parabolic curve. The
materialists have quoted a
passage of Locke in favour
of their doctrine who seemed
to doubt "whether it might
not have pleased God to
bestow a power of thinking on
matter".- But with the highest
veneration for this great reas-
oner, the founder of modern
philosophical logic, I think
there is little of his usual
strength of mind in this doubt.
It appears to me that he
might as well have asked
whether it might not have
pleased God to make a
house it's own tennant.
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] - I am not a professed

[page]79|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00079|dnp14a079pp|92018139[/page]
79
materialist;- but I think you [deletion]rather[/deletion]
treat matter too lightly the
modest doubts of Locke on this
subject; & without considering
me as a partizan you will
I hope allow me to state some
of the reasons which I have
heard good physiologists
advance in favour of that
opinion to which you are
so hostile.-
In the first accretion of the
parts of animated beings they
appear almost like the crystal
lized matter, with the simplest
kind of life scarcely sensitive
The gradual operations by
which they acquire new
organs & new powers corres-
ponding to these organs, till
they arrive at full maturity,
forcibly strike the mind
with the ideas that the powers

[page]80|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00080|dnp14a080pp|92018140[/page]
of life reside in the arrangement
by which the organs are pro-
duced. - Then as there is a
gradual increase of power
corresponding to the increase of
perfection of the organization,
so there is a gradual diminution
of it connected with the
decay of the body. As the im-
becility of infancy corresponds
to the weakness of organization,
so the energy of youth & the 
power of manhood are marked
by it's strength & the feebleness
& dotage of old age are in
the direct ratio of the decline
of the perfection of the organization
and the mental powers in
extreme old age seem des-
troyed at the same time with
the corporal ones, till the
ultimate dissolution of the
frame, when the elements are

[page]81|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00081|dnp14a081pp|92018141[/page]
81
again restored to that dead
nature from which they were
originally derived. Then, there
was a period when the greatest
philosopher, statesman, or hero
that ever existed was a
mere living atom, an [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
organized form with the
sole power of perception, &
the combinations that a Newton
formed before birth or
immediately after cannot
be imagined to have possessed
the slightest intellectual
character. -
If a peculiar principle be
supposed necessary to intelligence
it must exist throughout
animated nature. The Elephant
approaches nearer to man
in intellectual power than
the oyster does to the Elephant
& a link of sensitive nature
may be traced from the polypus

[page]82|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00082|dnp14a082pp|92018142[/page]
to the philosopher. Now in the
polypus the sentient principle
is divisible & from one polypus
or one earthworm may be
formed [deletion]th[/deletion] two or three, all
of which become perfect
animals & have perception
& volition: therefore at least
the sentient principle has
this property is common with
matter,- that it is divisible.
Then, to these difficulties add
the dependence of all the
higher faculties of all the mind
upon the state of the brain:
Remember that not only all
the intellectual powers, but
even sensibility is destroyed
by the presence of a little
blood upon the cerebellum
& the difficulties increase:
Call to mind likewise the

[page]83|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00083|dnp14a083pp|92018143[/page]
83
suspension of animation in cases
similar to that of our friend 
when there are no signs of
life & when animation re
turns, only with the return
of organic action. Surely in 
all these instances every
thing which you consider as
belonging to spirit appears
in intimate dependence upon
the arrangement & properties
of matter. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] The arguments you
have made are those which are
generally employed by physiologists;
they have weight in appearance
but not in reality; they prove
that a certain perfection of the
machinery of the body is essen-
tial to the exercise of the
powers of the mind;- but, they
do not prove that the machine
is the mind; without the
eye there can be no sensations

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00084|dnp14a084pp|92018144[/page]
of vision and without the brain there
could be no recollected visible
ideas, but neither the optic
nerve, nor the brain can be
considered as but the percipient
principle, - they are but the
instruments of a power which has
nothing in common with them
What may be said of the
nervous system may be applied
to a different part of the frame;
stop the motion of the heart &
sensibility & life cease, yet
the living principle is not
in the heart, nor in the arterial [insertion]blood[/insertion]
which it sends to every part
of the system. A savage who
saw the operations of a number
of power looms weaving stockings
cease at once on the stopping
the motion of a wheel might
well imagine that the motive
force was in the wheel, he

[page]85|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00085|dnp14a085pp|92018145[/page]
85
could not divine that it more
immediately depended upon
the steam & ultimately upon
a fire below a concealed
boiler. The philosopher sees the
fire which is the cause of the
motion of this complicated
machinery so unintelligible
to the Savage, but both are
equally ignorant of the
[underline]divine fire[/underline] which is the
cause of the mechanism of
organized structures. Profoundly
ignorant on this subject, all
that we can do is to give
a history of our own minds
The external world or matter
is to us in fact nothing
but a heap or cluster of
sensations, & in looking back
to the memory of our own being
we find one principle, which

[page]86|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00086|dnp14a086pp|92018146[/page]
may be called the [underline]monad[/underline] or
[underline]self[/underline] constantly present, intimate
ly associated with a particular
class of sensations which we
call our own body or organs.
These organs are connected
with other sensations &
move as it were with them
in circles of existence quitting
for a time some trains of
sensation to return to others;
but the monad is always
present, - we can fix no beg-
inning to its operations, we
can place no limit to them.
We sometimes in sleep lose
the beginning & end of a
dream & recollect the middle
of it & the dream has no
connexion with another & yet
we are conscious of an
infinite variety of dreams

[page]87|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00087|dnp14a087pp|92018147[/page]
87
& there is a strong analogy for
believing in an infinity of
past existences which must
have had connexion; - &
human life may be regarded
as a type of infinite &
immortal life & its succession
of sleep & dreams as a type
of the changes of death & birth
to which from it's nature
it is liable. That the ideas
belonging to the mind were
originally gained from
those classes of sensations
called organs it is impossible
to deny, as it is impossible
to deny that mathematical
truth, depend upon the
signs which express them:
but these signs are not
themselves [insertion]the[/insertion] truths, nor are
the organs the mind.

[page]88|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00088|dnp14a088pp|92018148[/page]
The whole history of intellect
is a history of change according
to a certain law; - & we
retain the memory only
of these changes which may
be useful to us. The child
forgets what happened to
it in the womb; the recollections
of the infant likewise before
two years are soon lost,
yet many of the habits acquired
in that age are retained
thro' life. The sentient prin-
ciple gains thoughts by
material instruments & it's
sensations change as these
instruments change.- And, in
old age, the mind as it were,
falling a sleep to awake to a
new existence. With it's present
organization the intellect of
man is naturally limited

[page]89|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00089|dnp14a089pp|92018149[/page]
89
& imperfect;- but this depends
upon it's material machinery
& in a higher organized form
it may be imagined to
possess infinitely higher powers.
Were man to be immortal
with his present corporeal
frame, this immortality would
only belong to the machinery
& with respect to acquisitions
of mind he would virtually
die every two or three hundred
years, - that is to say, a
certain quantity of ideas
only could be remembered
& the supposed immortal
being would be with respect
to what had happened a
thousand years ago as the
adult man is with respect
to what happened in the
first year of his life. To

[page]90|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00090|dnp14a090pp|92018150[/page]
attempt to reason upon the
manner in which the organs
are connected with sensation
would be useless;- the nerves
& brain have some immediate
relation to these vital functions
but how they act, it is im-
possible to say. From the
rapidity of infinite variety
of the phenomena of perception,
it seems extremely probable
that these must be in the
brain & nerves matter of
a nature far more subtile
& refined than any thing dis-
covered in them by observation
& experiment & that the
immediate connexion between
the sentient principle & the
body may be established by
kinds of ethereal matter which

[page]91|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00091|dnp14a091pp|92018151[/page]
91
which can never be evident to
the senses & which may bear
the same relations to heat,
light & electricity that these
refined forms or modes of
existence of matter bear to
the gasses. Motion is most
easily produced by the lighter
species of matter; - & yet im-
ponderable agents such as
electricity possess force suffi-
cient to overturn the weightiest
structures. Nothing can be
further from my meaning than
to attempt any definition on
this subject, nor would I
ever embrace or give authenticity
to that idea of Newton who
supposes that the immediate
cause of sensation may be
in undulations of an etherial
medium. It does not however

[page]92|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00092|dnp14a092pp|92018152[/page]
appears improbable to me that
some of the more refined
machinery of thought may
adhere even in another state
to the sentient principle: -
for tho' the organs of gross
sensation, the nerves & brain
are destroyed by death, yet
something of the more etherial
nature which I have supposed
may be less destructible, And, 
I sometimes imagine that many
of these powers which have
been called instinctive belong
to the more refined clothing
of the spirit. Conscience indeed
seems to have some undefined
source & may bear relation
to a former state of being. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. All your notions
are merely ingenious speculations
Revelation gives no authority

[page]93|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00093|dnp14a093pp|92018153[/page]
93
to your ideas of spiritual
nature. The christian im-
mortality is founded upon
the resurrection of the body.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. - This I will
not allow. Even in the Mosaic
history of the creation of man
his frame is made in the
image of God, - that is,
capable of intelligence; - &
the creator breathes into it
the breath of life, - his own
essence. - Then our Saviour
has said, - "of the God of
Abraham, of [person]person_1112|Isaac[/person] & of
[person]person_1113|Jacob[/person]," "He is not the God
of the dead but of the living"
S[superscript]t[/superscript] Paul has described the
clothing of the spirit in
a new & glorious body
taking the analogy from
the living germ in the

[page]94|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00094|dnp14a094pp|92018154[/page]
seed of the plant which is
not quickened till after
apparent death. And the
catastrophe of our planet
which it is revealed is to
be destroyed & purified by
fire before it is fitted
for the habitation of the blest
is in perfect harmony with
the view I have ventured
to suggest. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. - I cannot make
your notions coincide with
what I have been accustomed
to consider the meaning of
holy writ. - you allow every
thing belonging to the material
life to be dependant upon
the organization of the body
& yet you imagine the spirit
after death clothed with
a new body & in the system
of reward & punishment

[page]95|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00095|dnp14a095pp|92018155[/page]
95
this body is rendered happy
or miserable for actions
committed by another & an
extinct frame. A particular
organisation of the [deletion]frames[/deletion]
stomach or several organs
leads to improper & immoral
gratification; it does not
appear to me ascending to
the principles of eternal
justice that the body of the
resurrection should be
punished for crimes de-
pendant upon a conformation
now dissolved & destroyed. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. Nothing is
more absurd, I may say
more uniform than for man
with a ken surrounded by
the dense mists of sense,
to [underline]reason[/underline] respecting the
decrees of eternal justice.

[page]96|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00096|dnp14a096pp|92018156[/page]
you adopt here the same
limited view that you
embraced in reasoning
against the indestructibility
of the sentient principle
in man , from the apparent
[insertion]division[/insertion] of the living principle in
the polypus, not recollecting
that to [deletion]im[/deletion]prove a quality
can be increased or
exalted does not prove
that it can be annihilated.
If there be, which I think
cannot be doubted, a
consciousness of good & evil
constantly belonging to
the sentient principle in
man, the rewards & punish
ments naturally belong to
the acts of this consciousness
- to obedience or disobedience;
& the indestructibility of the

[page]97|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00097|dnp14a097pp|92018157[/page]
97
sentient being is necessary to
the decrees of eternal justice
on your view even in [underline]this[/underline]
[underline]life[/underline], [underline]just[/underline] punishments for
crimes would be almost
impossible, for the materials
of which human beings are
composed change rapidly
& in a few years probably
not an atom of the primitive
structure remains, yet even
the materialist is obliged in
old age to do penance for
the sins of his youth, &
does not complain of the
injustice of his decrepit
body entirely changed &
made stiff by time,- suffering
for the intemperance of his
vigorous youthful & flexible
organs. On my idea conscience
is the frame of the mind
fitted for it's probation in

[page]98|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00098|dnp14a098pp|92018158[/page]
in mortality;- & this is
exactly in harmony with the
foundations of our religion,
the divine origin of which
is marked no less by it's
history than it's harmony
with the principles of our
nature.- obedience to it's
precepts not only prepares
for a better state of existence
in another world, but is
likewise calculated to
make us happy here. We
are constantly taught to
renounce sensual pleasure
& selfish gratifications, to
forget our body & sensible
organs, to associate our
pleasures with mind, to
fix our [deletion]xxxxxxxxx[/deletion] affections
upon the great ideal -
generalization of intelligence

[page]99|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00099|dnp14a099pp|92018159[/page]
99
in the one Supreme Being. And
that we are capable of
forming to ourselves an im-
perfect idea even of the
infinite mind is I think
a strong presumption of our
own immortality & of the
distinct relation which our
finite knowledge bears to
eternal wisdom.
[underline]Philalathes[/underline].- I am pleased
with your views; they coincide
with those I had formed at
the time my imagination
was employed upon the vision
of the Colosaeum, which I
repeated to you & are not
in opposition with the opinions
that the cool judgment &
sound & humble faith [insertion]of Ambrosio[/insertion] have
led me since to embrace.
The doctrine of the [underline]materialists[/underline]

[page]100|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00100|dnp14a100pp|92018160[/page]
was always even in my youth
a cold, heavy, dull &
insupportable doctrine to me
& necessarily tending to
atheism.-
When I had heard with some
disgust in the dissecting rooms
the plan of the physiologist
of the gradual accretion of
matter & it's becoming en-
dowed with irritability
ripening into sensibility
& acquiring such organs
as were necessary by it's
own inherent forces, & at
last rising into intellectual
existence, a walk into the
green fields or woods by
the banks of rivers brought
back my feelings from
[underline]nature[/underline] to God,- [deletion]from[/deletion]
[deletion]inanimate forms to the[/deletion]
[deletion]generative & creative powers[/deletion]

[page]101|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00101|dnp14a101pp|92018161[/page]
101
[deletion]of that which is living &[/deletion]
[deletion]which only springs from life.[/deletion]
I saw in all the powers of
matter the instruments of the
Deity. The sunbeams, the
breath of the Zephyr, awaken
and animation in forms
prepared by divine intelligence
to receive it. The insensate
seek, the slumbering eggs
which were to be vivified
appeared, like the new borne
animal, works of a divine
mind. I saw [underline]love[/underline] as the
creative principle in the
material world & this
love only as a divine attribute
Then my own mind I felt
connected with new sensations
& indefinite hopes, a thirst
for immortality. The great
names of other ages & of
[unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] by divine intelligece
I saw in all the powers of

[page]102|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00102|dnp14a102pp|92018162[/page]
distant nations appeared to
me to be still living around
me: &, even in the funereal
monuments of the heroic &
the great, I saw as it were
the dance if the indestructible
city of mind. These feelings
though generally considered
as poetical, yet I think
offer a sound philosophical
argument in favour of the
immortality of the soul.
In all the habits & instincts
of young animals, their feelings
or movements may be traced
in intimate relation to their
improved perfect state. Their
sports have always affinity
to their modes of hunting or
catching their prey food; &
young birds even in the nest
give marks of fondness,

[page]103|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00103|dnp14a103pp|92018163[/page]
103
which when their organs are
developed become the signs
of actions necessary to the
reproduction of the species.
The desire of glory, of honour,
of immortal fame & of
constant knowledge so usual
in young persons of well
organized minds, cannot
I think be other than symptoms
of the infinite & progressive
nature of intellect - hopes
which as they cannot be
gratified here belong to
a frame of mind suited
to a nobler [insertion]state of[/insertion] existence.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- Religion
whether natural or revealed
has always the same beneficial
influence on the mind. In
youth, in health & prosperity

[page]104|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00104|dnp14a104pp|92018164[/page]
it awakens feelings of gratitude
& sublime love & purifies
at the same time that it
exalts the mind. But it is
in misfortune, in sickness,
in age, that it's effects are
most truly & beneficially
felt. When submission in
faith & humble trust in
the divine will, from duties
become pleasures, undecaying
sources of consolation. Then
it creates powers which
were believed to be extinct
& gives a freshness to the
mind which was supposed
to have passed away for ever
but which is now renovated
as an immortal hope. Then
it is the Pharos guiding the
wave tost mariner to his
home, as the calm & beautiful

[page]105|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00105|dnp14a105pp|92018165[/page]
105
still basins or fiords sur-
rounded by tranquil groves
& pastoral meadows to the
Norwegian pilot escaping
from a heavy storm in
the North Sea: or as the
green & dewy spot gushing
with fountains to the
exhausted & thirsty traveller
in the midst of the desert.
It's influence outlives
all earthly enjoyments &
becomes stronger as the
organs decay & the frame
dissolves. It appears as
that evening star of
light in the horizon of
life which we are sure
is to become in another
season a morning star,
& it throws it's radiance
thro' the gloom & shadow

[underline]Dialogue V.[/underline]
[underline]The chemical Philosopher[/underline]
I had been made religious
by the conversations of Ambrosio
in Italy: my faith was
strengthened & exalted by the
opinions of [person]person_122|the Unknown[/person] for
whom I had not merely that
veneration awakened by
exalted talents but a strong
affection founded upon the
essential benefit of the preser-
vation of my life owing to
him. I ventured the evening
after our visit to the cave
of Adelsberg to ask him some
questions relating to his
history & adventures.- He said
to attempt to give you any
idea of the [deletion][unclear]foundation[/unclear][/deletion] formation of my
character would lead me into
the history of my youth, which

[page]108|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00108|dnp14a108pp|92018168[/page]
almost approaches to a tale of
romance. The source of the
little information & intelligence
I possess I must refer to a
restless activity of spirit,
a love of glory, which ever
belonged to my infancy &
a sensibility easily excited
& [insertion]not[/insertion] easily conquered.
My parentage was humble,
yet I can believe a traditional
history of my [deletion]parental[/deletion] paternal grand-
mother that the origin of our
family was from an old noble
Norman stock. I found this
belief upon certain feelings
which I can only refer to an
hereditary source, a pride of
decorum, a tact & refinement
even in boyhood & which are
contradictory to the idea of
my origin from a race of
peasants.
Accident opened to me in
early youth a philosophical career

[page]109|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00109|dnp14a109pp|92018169[/page]
109
which I pursued with success.
In manhood fortune smiled
upon me & made me independent
I then really became a philosopher
& pursued my travels with
the object of instructing myself
& of benefitting mankind. I
have seen most parts of
Europe & conversed I believe
with all the illustrious men
of science belonging to them.
My life has not been un-
like that of the antient
Greek sages. I have added some
little to the [deletion]stock[/deletion] quantity
& I have endeavoured to add something to the quantity of
of [insertion]human happiness[/insertion] human [deletion]happiness[/deletion] [insertion]knowledge[/insertion]. In my
early life I was a sceptic.
I have informed you, how
I became a believer & I
constantly bless the supreme
Intelligence for the favour of
some gleams of divine light
which have been vouchsafed

[page]110|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00110|dnp14a110pp|92018170[/page]
to me in this our state of
darkness & doubt.-
[underline]Philalethes[/underline].- I am surprised
that with your powers you did
not enter into a professional
career either of law, or of
politicks; you would have
gained the highest honours
& distinctions.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- To me there
never has been a higher source
of honour or distinction than
that connected with advances
in science. I have not possessed
enough of the eagle in my character
to make a direct flight to
the loftiest altitudes in the
social world;- & I certainly
never endeavoured to reach these
heights by using the creeping
powers of the reptile, who in
ascending, generally chooses the
dirtiest path because it is
the easiest.-

[underline]Eubathes[/underline].- I have often wondered
that men of fortune & of rank
do not apply themselves more
to philosophical pursuits; they
offer a delightful & enviable
road to distinction, one founded
upon the blessings & benefits [deletion]of[/deletion]
conferred on our fellow creatures;
they do not supply the same
sources of temporary popularity
as successes in the senate or
at the bar; but the glory result-
ing from them is permanent
& independent of vulgar taste
or caprice. In looking back to
the history of the last five
reigns in England, we find
Boyles, Cavendishes & Howards
who rendered these great
names more illustrious by
their scientific honours;- but
we may in vain search the
aristocracy now for philosophers;
& there are very few persons

[page]112|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00112|dnp14a112pp|92018172[/page]
who pursue science with true
dignity;- it is followed more
as connected with objects
of profit, than those of fame
& there are fifty persons who
take out patents for supposed
inventions for one who makes
a real discovery.-
[person]person_102|[underline]Phil[/underline][/person].- The information we
have already received from
you proves to me that chemistry
has been your favourite pursuit.
I am surprised at this. The
higher mathematics & pure
physics appear to me to offer
much more noble objects of
contemplation & fields of dis-
covery;- & practically considering
the results of the chemist are
much more humble, belonging
principally to the Apothecary's
shop & the kitchen.-
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. - I feel disposed to
join you in attacking this

[page]113|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00113|dnp14a113pp|92018173[/page]
113
favourite study of our friend;-
[underline]but merely[/underline] to provoke him
to defend it.- I wish our attack
would induce him to indicate
his science & that we might
enjoy a little of the sport of
literary gladiators, at least
in order to call forth his
skill & awaken his eloquence.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person]. I have no objection
Let there be a fair discussion;
remember we fight only with
foils & the point of mine
shall be covered with velvet.
In your attack upon chemistry
Philalethes, you limited the
uses of it to the Apothecary's
shop & the kitchen. The first
is an equivocal use. By
introducing it into the kitchen
you make it an [deletion]art[/deletion] art
fundamental to all others. But
if what you had stated had

[page]114|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00114|dnp14a114pp|92018174[/page]
really meant to be serious,
it would not have discovered
a reply. As it is in mere
playfulness, it shall not be
thrown away. I want eloquence
however to adorn my subject;
yet it is sufficiently exciting
even to awaken feeling .-
Persons in general look at
the magnificent [deletion]fabric[/deletion] fabric of
civiliz[deletion]ation[/deletion] [insertion]ed[/insertion] society as a
result of the accumulated
labour, ingenuity & enterprise
of man thro a long course
of ages without attempting to
define what has ben owing
to the different branches of
human industry & science &
usually attribute to politicians
statesmen & warriors a much
greater share than really
belongs to them in the work.
What they have done is in
reality little. The beginning

[page]115|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00115|dnp14a115pp|92018175[/page]

of civilization in the discovery of
some useful arts by which
men acquire property, comforts
or business. The necessity or
desire of possessing them leads
to laws and social institutions.
The discovery of peculiar arts
gives superiority to particular
nations ;- & the love of power
induces them to employ this
superiority to subjugate other
nations, who learn their arts
& ultimately adopt their manners
so that in reality, the origin
as well as the progress &
improvement of civil society is
founded in mechanical &
chemical inventions.- No people
have ever arrived at any
degree of perfection in their
institutions, who have not perfected
in a high degree the useful &
refined arts.- The comparison of

[page]116|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00116|dnp14a116pp|92018176[/page]
savage & civilized man in
fact demonstrates the triumph
of [insertion]chemical &[/insertion] mechanical philosophy as
the causes not only of the
physical but ultimately even
of moral improvement. Look
at the condition of man in
the lowest state in which we
are acquainted with him,-
take a native of New Holland
advanced only a few steps above
the animal creation & that
principally by the use of fire,
naked, defending himself against
wild beasts or killing them
for food only by weapons made
of wood hardened in the fire,
or pointed with stones or fish
bones, living only in holes dug
out of the earth or in huts
rudely constructed of a few branches
of trees covered with grass,
having no approach to the
enjoyment of luxuries or even

[page]117|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00117|dnp14a117pp|92018177[/page]
117
comforts;- unable to provide
for his most pressing wants;-
having a language scarcely
articulate relating only to
the great objects of nature,
or to his most pressing necesses
ties or desires;- & living
solitary or in single families
unacquainted with religion
government or laws;- submitted
to the mercy of nature or
the elements. How different is
man in his highest state of
cultivation. Every part of his
body covered with the products
of different chemical &
mechanical arts,- made not
only useful in protecting him
from the inclemency of the
seasons, but combined [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] in forms
of beauty & variety; creating
out of the dust of the earth
from the clay under his
feet instruments of use &

ornament; Extracting metals from
the rude ore, & giving to them
a hundred different shapes for
a thousand different purposes;
Selecting & improving the
vegetable productions with
which he covers the earth;-
not only subduing, but taming
& domesticating the wildest
the fleetest & the strongest
inhabitants of the wood, the
mountain & the air; [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
making the winds carry him
on every part of the immense
ocean,- & compelling the
elements of air, water & even
fire as it were to labour
for him;- concentrating in
small space materials which
act as the thunderbolt &
directing their energies so as
to destroy at immense
distances; blasting the rock

in removing the mountain, carrying
water from the valley to the
hill, perpetuating thought in
imperishable words, rendering
immortal the creation of genius
& presenting them as common
property to all awakening
minds, - becoming as it were
the true image of divine
inteligence, receiving & bestow-
ing the breath of life in
the influence of civilzation.
[underline]Euthabes.[/underline] - Really you are
in the poetical not the chemical
chair, or rather on the tripod.
We claim from you some
accuracy of detail, some
minute information, - some
proofs of what you assert. -
What you attribute to the
chemical & mechanical arts
or might with the same pro
priety attribute to the fine

arts,- to letters - to political
improvement & to these in-
ventions of which Minerva &
Apollo & not Vulcan are
the patrons.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- I will be more
minute. -  you will allow that the
rendering skins insoluble in
water by combining with them
the astringent principle of
certain vegetables is a chemical
invention, and that without leather
our shoes, our carriages, our equi-
pages could be very ill made
you will permit me to say 
that the bleaching & dying of
wool & silk, cotton & flax are
chemical processes & that the
conversion of them into different
clothes is a mechanical invention
That the working of iron, copper,
tin, & lead & the other metals

alloys by which almost all the
instruments necessary for the

121
further, the joiner, the stone-mason
the ship builder & the smith
are made are chemical inven-
-tions. - Even the press to [deletion]which[/deletion] 
the influence of which I am
disposed to attribute as much
as you can do, could not
have existed in any state
of perfection without a metallic
alloy. The combining of alkali
& sand & contain clays &
& porcelain is a chemical
process. The colours which the
artist employs to frame
resemblances of maternal
objects, or to create combinations
more beautiful than even
existed in every branch of the
common & fine arts, in
every department of human
industry, the influence of this

[page]122|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00122|dnp14a122pp|92018183[/page]
science is feltl & we may finish
in the fable of Prometheus
taking the flame from heaven
to animate his his man of clay
an emlem of the effects of
fire in it's application to
chemical purposes in in creating
the activity & almost the
life of civil society. -
[underline]Philalethes.[/underline] It appears to me
that you attribute to science
what in many cases has
been the result of accident.
The process of most of the 
useful arts which you call
chemical have been invented
& improved without an re-
fined views, withough any general
system of knowledge. Lucretius
attributes to accident the
discovery of the fusion of the
metals. A person in touching 
a shell fish observes that it
emits a purple liquid as a

[page]123|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00123|dnp14a123pp|92018184[/page]
123
dye, hence the Tyrian purple
clay is observed to harden in
the fire & hence the invention
of bricks which could hardly
fail ultimately to lead to
the discovery of porcelain. Even
glass the most perfect & beauti-
ful of these manufactures you
call chemical, is said to
have been discovered by accident
Theophrastus states that
some merchants who were 
cooking on lumps of soda, or
natron near to the mouth of the
[place]place_1405|river Belus[/place] observed that
a hard vitreous substance
was formed where the fused
natron ran into the sand. 
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person] - I will readily
allow that accident has had 
much to do with the origin 
of the arts, as with the progress
of the sciences, - but it has 
been by scientific processes

[page]124|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00124|dnp14a124pp|92018185[/page]
& experiments that these accidental
results have been rendered really
applicable to the purposes of
common life.- Besides it requires
a certain degree of knowledge
& scientific combination to
understand & seize upon the
facts which have originated
in accident.- It is certain
that in all fires, alkaline
substances & sand are fused
together & clay hardened, yet
for ages after this discovery
of fire, glass & porcelain were
unknown, till some men of
genius profited by scientific
combination often observed but
never applicable. It suits the
indolence of those minds which
never attempt any thing &
which probably if they did
attempt any thing, would not
succeed to refer to accident

[page]125|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00125|dnp14a125pp|92018187[/page]
125
that which belongs to genius. It
is sometimes said by such
persons that the discovery of
the law of gravitation was
owing to accident & a ridicu-
lous story is told of the
falling of an apple as the
cause of this discovery, as
well might the invention
of fluxions or the architectural
wonders of the dome of [place]place_154|S[superscript]t[/superscript].
Peters[/place], or the miracles of
art, the [misc]misc_880|S[superscript]t[/superscript], John of Raphael[/misc]
or the [misc]misc_881|Apollo Belvedere[/misc] be
supposed to be owing to
accidental combination. In
the progress of an art from
it's [deletion]mo[/deletion][insertion]ru[/insertion]dest to it's more
perfect state the whole process
depends upon experiments. Science
is in fact nothing more than
the refinement of common sense
making use of facts already

[page]126|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00126|dnp14a126pp|92018188[/page]
known to acquire new facts.
Clays which are yellow are
known to burn red; calcareous
earth renders flint fusible;
the persons who have improved
earthenware made their selections
accordingly. Iron was discovered
at least 1000 years before
it was rendered malleable
& from what Herodotus says
of this discovery there can
be little doubt that it [deletion][unclear]has[/unclear][/deletion]
was developed by a scientific
worker in metals. Vitruvius
tells us that the ceruleum,
a colour made of copper which
exists in perfection in all
the old paintings of the
Greeks & Romans & on the
mummies of the Egyptians
was discovered by an Egyptian
King. There is therefore every
reason to believe that it
was not the result of
accidental combination, but

[page]127|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00127|dnp14a127pp|92018189[/page]
127
of experiments made for producing
or improving colours. Amongst
the antient philosophers many
discoveries are attributed to
Democritus & Anaxagoras;-
& connected with the chemical
arts the narrative of the
inventions of Archimedes alone
by Plutarch would seem
to shew how great is the
effect of science in creating
power. In modern times the
refining of sugar, the pre-
feration of nitre, the manu-
facturing of acids, salts &c
are all results of pure
chemistry.- Take gunpowder
as a specimen. No person
but a man infinitely diver-
sifying his processes & guided
by analogy could have
made such a discovery. Look
into the books of the alchemists

[page]128|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00128|dnp14a128pp|92018190[/page]
& some idea may be formed
of the effects of experiment.
it is true these persons were
guided by false views yet
they made most useful re-
searches,- as such [person]person_124|Bacon[/person] has
justly compared them to the
husbandman who searching
for an imaginary treasure
fertilized the soil. They
might likewise by com-
pared to persons who looking
for gold discover those
fragments of beautiful statues
which separately are of no
value & which appear of little
value to the persons who finds
them;- but which when selected
& put together by artists &
their defective parts supplied
are found to be wonderfully
perfect & worthy of conservation.
Look at the progress of the arts

[page]129|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00129|dnp14a129pp|92018191[/page]
129
since they have been enlightened
by a  [underline]system[/underline] of [underline]science[/underline], &
observe with what rapidity
they have advanced.- again
the steam engine in it's
rudest form was the result
of a chemical experiment. In
it's refined state it acquired
the combinations of all the
most recondite principles
of chemistry & mechanics;
& that excellent philosopher
who has given this wonder-
ful instrument of power to
civil society was led to
the great improvements he
made by the discoveries of
a kindred genius on the
heat absorbed when water
becomes steam & of the heat
evolved when steam becomes
water.- Even the most super
ficial observer must allow

[page]130|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00130|dnp14a130pp|92018192[/page]
in this case the triumph of
science for what a wonderful
impulse has this invention
given to the progress of the
arts & manufactories in our
country in - how much has it
diminished labour; how much
has it increased the real
strength of the country (acting
as it were with a thousand
hands, it has multiplied our
active population & receiving
it's elements of activity from
the bowels of the earth it per-
forms operations which former
ly were painful, oppressive
& unhealthy to the labourers
with regularity & constancy;
& gives security & precision
to the efforts of the manufacturer
with the inventions connected at
the same time that they have

[page]131|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00131|dnp14a131pp|92018193[/page]
131
greatly diminished labour of
body have tended to increase
power of mind & intellectual
resources. - [person]person_1114|Adam Smith[/person]
well observes that manufacturers
are always more ingenious
than husbandsman & manufact
urers that use machinery
will probably always be found
more ingenious than handicraft
manufacturers. - You spoke
of porcelain as a result
of accident: the improvements
invented in this country
as well as those made in
Germany & [place]place_897|France[/place] have
been entirely the result of
chemical experiments. The
[place]place_1406|Dresden[/place] & the [place]place_1407|Sevres[/place]
manufactories have been
the work of men of science
& it was by multiplying his
chemical researches that

[page]132|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00132|dnp14a132pp|92018194[/page]
[person]person_135|Wedgewood[/person] was enabled to
produce at so cheap a rate
these beautiful imitations
of the ancients which while
they surpass them in solidity
& perfection of material,
equal them in elegance,
variety & tasteful arrange
ment of their forms.-
In another department the
use of the electrical conduction
was a pure scientific com-
bination,- & the sublimity
of the discovery of the
American philosopher was
only equalled by the happy
application he immediately
made of it.- In our own
times it will be easy
to point out numerous instances
in which great improvements
& beneficial results connected
with the comforts, the happiness

[page]133|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00133|dnp14a133pp|92018195[/page]
133
& even life of our fellow
creatures have been to results
of scientific combinations;
but I cannot do this
without constituting myself
a judge of the ranks of
philosophers who are still
alive, whose researches are
known, whose labours are
respected & who will re-
view from posterity praise
that their contemporaries
hardly dare to bestow
upon them.-
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. - We will allow 
that you have shewn in
many cases the utility of
scientific investigations as
connected with the progress
of the useful arts: but in-
general both the principles
of chemistry are followed &
series  of experiments performed

[page]134|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00134|dnp14a134pp|92018196[/page]
without any view to utility
& a great noise is made if
a new metal or a new
substance is discovered, or
if some abstracted law is
made known relating to the
phenomena of nature, yet
amongst the variety of
new substances few have
been applied to any [underline]trifling[/underline]
use even, - & the greater
number have had no application
at all;- & with respect to
the general views of the
science, it would be difficult
to show that nay real
good had resulted from
the discovery or extension
of them.- It does not add
much to the dignity of a
pursuit that those persons
who have followed it for

[page]135|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00135|dnp14a135pp|92018197[/page]
135
profit have really been most
useful, - & that the mere
artizan or chemical manu-
facturer has done more for
society than the chemical
philosopher. Besides, it has
always appeared to me that
it is in the nature of this
science to encourage mediocrity
& to attach importance to
insignificant things; very
slight chemical labours
seem to give persons a
claim to the title of philos-
other. To have dissolved
a few grains of chalk in
an acid;- to have shewn
that a very useless stone
contains certain known
ingredients,- or that the
colouring matter of a flower
is soluble in acid &

[page]136|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00136|dnp14a136pp|92018198[/page]
not in alkali is thought by
some a foundation for chemical
celebrity. I once began to
attend a course of chemical
lectures & to read the journals
containing the ephemeral
productions of this science.
I was dissatisfied with the
nature of the evidence which
the professor adopted in
his demonstrations, & dis-
gusted with the series of
observations & experiments
which were brought forward
one month to be overturned
the next. - In November
there was a Zingerberic acid
which in January was shewn
to have no existence. One
year there was a vegetable
acid which the next was
shewn to be the same as
an acid known 30 years

137
ago - Today a man was celebr-
ated for having discovered
a new metal or a new
alkali & they flourished
like the scenes in a new
pantomime only to disappear
Then the great object of the
hundred trifles in the
science appeared to be to
destroy the reputation of the
three or four great men
whose labours were really
useful & had in them some
thing og dignity; & there
not being enough of trifling
results or false experiments
to fill up the pages of the
monthly journals, its deficiency
was supplied by some crude
theories or speculation of
unknown persons or by
some ill judged conscience or

[deletion]partial praise of the editor[/deletion]
[deletion]who has sometimes in his[/deletion]
[deletion]capacity been compared to[/deletion]

[deletion]generally has appeared to[/deletion]

[deletion]& his [unclear]xxxmotinous[/unclear] hum.-[/deletion]
[person]person_122|[underline]The unknown.[/underline][/person] - I deny in toto
the accuracy of what you are
advancing. I have already
shown that real philosophers
not labouring for [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] profit
have done much by their own
inventions for the useful arts,
& amongst the new substances
discovered many have had
immediate & very important
applications. The chlorine
or oxymuriatic [deletion]acid[/deletion] gas
of [person]person_224|Scheele[/person] was scarcely known
before it was applied by

[page]139|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00139|dnp14a139pp|92018201[/page]
139
Berthollet to bleaching. Scarcely
was muriatic acid gas discovered
by Priestley when Guyton de
Moreau used it for destroy
ing contagion.- Consider the
varied & diversified appli-
cations of platinum which
has owed it's existence as
a useful metal extensively to
the labours of an illustrious
chemical philosopher. Look
at the beautiful yellow
afforded by one of the new
metals - chrome. Consider
the medical effects of iodine
in some of the most painful
& disgusting maladies [superscript]x[/superscript] belonging
to human nature & remember
how short a time investigations
have been made for applying
the new substances. - Besides
the mechanical or chemical

[page]140|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00140|dnp14a140pp|92018202[/page]
manufacturer has rarely dis-
covered anything, he has
merely applied what the
philosopher has made known;
he has merely worked upon
the materials furnished to
him. We have no history
of the manner in which iron
was rendered malleable;
but we know that platinum
could only have been worked
by a person of the most re-
fined chemical resources
who made multiplied experiments
upon it after the most ingenious
& profound views. But waving
all common utility, all
vulgar applications there
is something in knowing &
understanding the operations
of nature, - some pleasure

[page]141|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00141|dnp14a141pp|92018203[/page]
141
in contemplating the modes &
harmony of the arrangements
belonging to the terrestrial
system of things. There is
no absolute utility in
poetry;- but it gives pleasure
refines & exalts the mind.
Philosophic pursuits have
likewise a noble & independent
use of this kind & there is
a double reason offered for
pursuing them,- for whilst
in their sublime speculations
they reach to the heavens
in their application they
belong to the earth. Whilst
they exalt the intellect, they
provide food for our common
wants & likewise minister
to the noblest appetites &
most exalted veins belonging
to our nature. The results

[page]142|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00142|dnp14a142pp|92018204[/page]
of this science are not like
the temples of the ancients in
which statues of the Gods
were placed, where incense
was offered & sacrifices were
performed & which were
presented to the adoration of
the multitude founded upon
superstitious feelings;- but,
they are rather like the
palaces of the moderns, to be
admired & used & where
the statues which in the
ancients raised feelings of
adoration or awe, now produce
only feelings of pleasure &
gratify a refined taste.-
It is surely a pure delight
to know how & by what
process this earth is clothed
with verdure & life; - how
the clouds [deletion]&[/deletion] mists & rain
are formed;- what causes

[page]143|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00143|dnp14a143pp|92018205[/page]
143
all the changes of this terrestrial
system of things & by what
divine laws under is pres-
served amidst apparent con-
fusion.- It is a sublime
occupation to investigate
the cause of the tempest &
the volcano & to point out
their use in the economy
of things; - to bring the
lightning from the clouds
& make it subservient
to our experiments; - to
produce as it were a micro-
cosm in the laboratory of
art & to reason & weigh
those invisible atoms which
by their motions & changes
according to laws impressed
upon them by the divine
intelligence constitute the
universe of things. - The

[page]144|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00144|dnp14a144pp|92018206[/page]
true chemical philosopher sees
good in all the diversified
forms of the external world.
Whilst he investigates the
operations of infinite power
guided by infinite wisdom
all low prejudices, all mean
superstitions disappear from
his mind; he sees man an
atom amidst atoms fixed
upon a point in space &
yet modifying the laws that
around him by under-
standing them, & gaining as
it were a kind of dominion
over time & an empire in
material space & exerting on
a scale infinitely small
a power seeming a [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] sent
of shadow or reflection of
a creative energy & which
entitles him to the distinction

[page]145|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00145|dnp14a145pp|92018207[/page]
145
of being made in the image
of God & animated by
a spark of the Divine mind.
Whilst chemical pursuits
exalt the understanding, they
do not depress the imagination
or weaken genuine feeling.
Whilst they give the mind
habits of accuracy, by
obliging [insertion]it[/insertion] to attend to facts
they likewise extend its
analogies;- & tho' conversant
with the minute forms of
things, they have for their
ultimate end the great
& magnificent objects of
nature. - they regard the
formation of a crystal, the
structure of a pebble, the
nature of a clay on earth
as they apply to the causes
of the diversity, of our moun-
tain chains, the appearances

[page]146|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00146|dnp14a146pp|92018208[/page]
of the winds, thunderstorms,
meteors, The earthquake, the
volcano & all those phenomena
which offer the most striking
images to the poet & the
painter; They keep alive
that inextinguishable thirst
after knowledge, which is
one of the greatest characteristics
of our nature, - for every
discovery opens a new field
for investigation of facts,-
shows us the imperfection
of our theories. It has [insertion]justly[/insertion] been
said that the greater the
circle of light, the greater
the boundary of darkness by
which it is surrounded. This
strictly applies to chemical
inquiries & hence they are
wonderfully suited to the
progressive nature of the
human intellect, which by

its increasing efforts to
acquire a higher kind of
wisdom & a state in which
truth is fully & brightly
revealed seems as it
were to demonstrate its
birth right to immortality.
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] I am glad that
my opposition has led you
to so complete a vindication
of your favourite science.
I want no further proof
of its utility;- I regret [insertion]that[/insertion]
I have not before made
it a particular object of
study.-
[underline]Philolethes[/underline]. - As our friend
has so fully convinced us
of the importance of chemistry
I hope he will descend to
some particulars as to it's
real nature. Its' objects, it's
instruments.- I would willingly
have a definition of chemistry

[page]148|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00148|dnp14a148pp|92018210[/page]
& some idea of the qualifications
necessary to become a chemist;-
& of the apparatus essential
for understanding what has
been already done in the
science & for pursuing new
inquiries.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- There is nothing
more difficult than a good
definition;- for it is scarcely
possible to express in a few words
words the abstracted view
of an infinite variety of
facts. [person]person_231|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black[/person] has defined
chemistry to be that science
which treats of the effects of
heat & mixture,- but this
definition is in my opinion
much too limited. Another
author has defined chemistry
to be that science which
treats of the changes produced
in bodies by motions of their
ultimate particles or atoms;-
but this definition is hypothet-
ical, - for the ultimate particles

[page]149|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00149|dnp14a149pp|92018211[/page]
149
on atoms are mere creations
of the imagination. I will
give you a definition which
will have the merit of novelty
& which is probably general
in it's application. [underline]Chemistry[/underline]
[underline]relates to those operations[/underline]
[underline]by which the intimate nature[/underline]
[underline]of bodies is changed,- or by[/underline]
[underline]which they acquire new[/underline]
[underline]properties[/underline].- This definition will
not only apply to the effects of mixture
but to the phenomena of electricity.
in short to all the changes which
do not merely depend upon the motion
or division of masses of matter.
However difficult it may have been
to have given you a definition of
chemistry, it is still [underline]more difficult[/underline]
to give you a detail of all the
qualities necessary for a chemical
philosopher. I will not name as many
as Athenaeus has named for a
cook, who, he says ought to be

[page]150|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00150|dnp14a150pp|92018212[/page]
a mathematician, a theoretical
musician, a natural philosopher,
a natural historian &c, though
you had a disposition just now to
make chemistry merely subservient
to the uses of the [unclear]kitchen[/unclear], but I
will seriously mention some of the
studies fundamental to the higher
departments of this science. A
man may be a very good practical
chemist perhaps without possessing
them;-  but he never can become
a great chemical philosopher. The
person who wishes to understand
the higher departments of chemistry
or to pursue them in their most
interesting relations to the economy
of nature ought to be well grounded
in elementary mathematics; he will
oftener have to refer to arithmetic
than algebra & to algebra than
to geometry, but all these sciences
lend their aid to Chemistry, arith-
metic in determining the proportions of
of analytical results & the relative

[page]151|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00151|dnp14a151pp|92018213[/page]
151
weights of the elements of bodies, algebra
in ascertaining the laws of the pressure
of elastic fluids, the force of vapour
as dependant upon temperature &
the effects of masses & surfaces on the
communication & radiation of heat.
The applications of geometry are
principally limited to the determination
of the crystalline forms of bodies
which constitute the most important
type of their nature & often offer
important limits for analytical
researches respecting their composition.
The first principles of natural philoso-
phy on generał physics ought not
to be entirely unknown to the
chemist. As the most active agents
are fluids, elastic fluids, heat
light & electricity, he ought to
have a general knowledge of me-
chanicks, hydroponics, pneumatics,
optics & electricity. Latin & Greek
among the dead & French among the
modern languages are necessary &
as the most important after French,

[page]152|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00152|dnp14a152pp|92018214[/page]
German & Italian. - In natural
history & in literature what belongs
to a liberal education such as
that of our universities is all
that is required. Indeed a young
man who has performed the ordinary
course of college studies which are
supposed fitted for common life
& for refined society has all the
preliminary knowledge necessary
to commence the study of chemistry.
The apparatus essential to the
modern chemical philosopher is
much lass bulky & expensive than
that used by the ancients.- An air
pump, an electrical machine, a
voltaic battery (all of which may
be upon a small scale) a blow pipe -
apparatus, a bellows & forge, a
mercurial or water gas apparatus,
cups & basins of platina & glass
& the common reagents for chemistry
are what are required. All the
implements absolutely necessary may
be carried in a small trunk &
some of the best & most refined

[page]153|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00153|dnp14a153pp|92018215[/page]
153
researches of modern chemists have
been made by means of an apparatus
which might with care be contained
in a small travelling carriage, &
the expense of which is only a few
pounds.-
The facility with which chemical
inquiries are carried on &
the simplicity of the apparatus
offer additional reasons to those
I have already given for the
pursuit of this science. It is
not injurious to the health. The
modern chemist is not like the
ancient one who passed the
greater part of his time exposed
to the heat & smoke of a furnace
& the unwholesome vapours of
acids & alkalis & other menstrua
of which for a single experiment
be considered several pounds.
His processes may be carried on
in the drawing room & some of
them are [insertion]no less[/insertion] [deletion]so[/deletion] beautiful in appearance
than satisfactory in their results.

[page]154|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00154|dnp14a154pp|92018216[/page]
It was said by an author belonging
to the last century of Alchemy-
"that it's beginning was deceit,
it's prospects laborious & it's end
beggary" It may be said of
modern chemistry that it's beginning
is pleasure, it's prospects knowledge
& it's objects truth & utility-
I have spoken of the scientific
attainments necessary for the
chemical philosopher. I will say
a few words of the intellectual
qualities necessary for discovery
or for the advancement of the
science. Amongst them patience,
industry & neatness in manipulations
& accuracy & minuteness in
observing & registering the phenomena
they present are essential. A steady
hand & a quick eye are most
useful auxiliaries, but there have
been very few great chemists who
have possessed these advantages
thro' life, for the business of the
laboratory is a service of danger

[page]155|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00155|dnp14a155pp|92018217[/page]
155
& the elements like the refractory
spirits of romance, though the obedient
slave of the magician yet sometimes
escape the influence of his talisman
& endanger his person. Both the
hands & the eyes of others however
may be sometimes advantageously
made use of. By often repeating
a process or an observation, the
operations or imperfect views are
annihilated; & provided the
assistant has no preconceived
notions of his own & is ignorant
of the object of his employer in
making the experiment his
simple & basic detail of facts
will often be the best foundation
for an opinion.
With respect to the higher qualities
of intellect necessary for understanding
& developing the general laws of
the science, the same talents I
believe are necessary as for making

[page]156|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00156|dnp14a156pp|92018218[/page]
advancement in every department
of human knowledge, I need not
be very minute - The imagination
must be active & brilliant in
seeking analogies yet entirely
under the influence of the judgment
in applying them. The memory
must be extensive & profound
rather however calling up general
views of things than minute
trains of thought. The mind
must not be like an Encyclopedia
- a burthen of knowledge, but
rather a critical dictionary
which abounds in generalities &
points our where  more minute
information may be obtained -
In detailing the results of
experiments & in giving them
to the world the chemical
philosopher should adopt the
simplest style & manner;- he
will avoid all ornaments
as something injurious to his
subject & should bear in mind

[page]157|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00157|dnp14a157pp|92018219[/page]
157
the saying of the [person]person_406|first king[/person] of
Great Britain respecting a [underline]sermon[/underline]
which was excellent in doctrine
but overcharged with poetical
allusions & figurative language
"that the tropes & metaphors
of the speaker were like the
brilliant wild flowers in a field
of corn very pretty, but which
did very much hurt the
corn".- In announcing even
the greatest & most important
discoveries,- the true philosopher
will communicate his details
with modesty & reserve. He will
rather be a useful servant of
the public bringing forth a
light from under his cloak
when it is needed in darkness
then a charlatan exhibiting
fireworks & having a trumpeter
to announce their magnificence.
I see you are smiling & think
what I am saying is bad taste

[page]158|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00158|dnp14a158pp|92018220[/page]
yet not withstanding I will provoke
your smiles still further by
saying a word or two on his
other moral qualifications.- That
he should be humble minded
you will readily allow & a
diligent searcher after truth &
neither diverted from this
great object by the love of transient
glory, or temporary popularity,-
looking rather at the opinions of
years than to that of a day &
seeking to be remembered &
named rather in the epochas of
historians, than in the columns
of newspaper-writers or journalists.
He should resemble the modern
geometricians in the greatness of
his views & the profoundness of
his researches & the ancient
alchemists in industry & piety-
I do not mean that he should
affix written prayers & inscriptions
of recommendations of his processes

[page]159|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00159|dnp14a159pp|92018221[/page]
159
to Providence as was the custom of
[person]person_1115|Peter Wolfe[/person], the last of the alchem
ical school & who was alive
in my early days;- but his mind
should always be awake to
devotional feeling & in contemplating
the variety & the beauty of the
external world & in developing
it's scientific wonders he will
always refer to that infinite
wisdom; thro' whose beneficence
he is permitted to enjoy knowledge
;- & in becoming wiser, he
will become better,- he will
rise at once in the scale of
intellectual & moral existence,
his increased sagacity will
be subservient to a more exalted
faith;- & in proportion as the
veil becomes thinner thro' which
he sees the causes of things, he
will admire more the brightness
of the divine light by which they
are rendered visible.-

[underline]Dialogue[/underline] 6[superscript]th[/superscript].
[underline]Pola[/underline]
or
[underline]Time[/underline]
During our stay in Illyria, I made
an excursion by water with my
Unknown preserver now become
my friend & Eubathes to Pola
in Istria. We entered the harbour
of Pola in a felucca when the
sun was setting & I know no scene
more splendid than the amphitheatre
seen from the sea in this light.
It appears not as a building in
ruins, but like a newly erected
work and the reflection of the colours
of it's brilliant marble & beautiful
forms seen upon the calm [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
surface of the waters gave to it
a double effect that of a glorious
production of art & of a magnificent
picture.- We examined the remains
of the arch of Augustus & the temple
very perfect monuments of imperial

[page]162|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00162|dnp14a162pp|92018224[/page]
grandeur,- with pleasure,- but the
splendid exterior of the amphitheatre
was not in harmony with the
bare & naked walls of the
interior.- There were none of those
durable & grand seats of marble
such as adorn the amphitheatre
of Verona; from which it is
probable that the whole of the
arena & conveniences for the
spectators had been constructed
of wood. Their total disappear-
ance led us to reflect upon
the causes of the destruction of
so many of the works of the
elder nations.- I said, in our
metaphysical abstractions we refer
the changes, the destruction of
material forms, [underline]to time[/underline], but
there must be physical laws in
nature by which they are produced
and I begged our new friend to
give us some ideas on this subject
in his character of chemical
philosopher.- If human science,
I said, has discovered the principles

[page]163|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00163|dnp14a163pp|92018225[/page]
163
of the decay of things, it is possible
that human art may supply
means of conservation & bestow
immortality on some of the
works which appear destined by
their perfection for future ages.
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- I shall willingly
communicate to you my views of
the operation of Time philosophically
considered, but as a great philosopher
has said, man can in no other
way command nature, but in
obeying her laws, & in these laws
the principle of change is a princlple
of life, without decay there can
be no reproduction; & every thing
belonging to the earth whether in
it's primitive state or modified
by human hands is submitted to
certain & immutable laws of
destruction as permanent &
universal as those which produce
the planetary motions.-
The property which as far as our

[page]164|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00164|dnp14a164pp|92018226[/page]
experience extends universally belongs
to matter, [underline]gravitation[/underline], is the first
& most general cause of change in
our terrestrial system;- & whilst
it preserves the great mass of the
globe in an uniform state, it's
influence is continually producing
alterations upon the surface. The
water raised in vapour by the
solar heat is precipitated by the
cool air in the atmosphere, it is
carried down by gravitation to
the surface & gains it's mechanical
force from this law. Whatever is
elevated above the superficies by
the powers of vegetation or animal
life, or by the efforts of man, by
gravitation constantly tends to
the common centre of attraction;
&, the great reason of the duration
of the pyramid above all other
forms is that it is most fitted
to resist the force of gravitation.
The arch, the pillar & all
perpendicular constructions are

[page]165|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00165|dnp14a165pp|92018227[/page]
165
liable to fall , when a degradation
from chemical or mechanical
causes takes place in their inferior
parts.- The forms upon the surface
of the globe are preserved from
the influence of gravitation by
the attraction of cohesion, or by
chemical attraction, but if
their parts had freedom of
motion, they would all be
levelled by this power, gravita -
tion.- & the globe would appear
as a plain & smooth oblate
spheroid flattened at the poles.
The attraction of cohesion on
chemistry in its most energetic
state is not capable of being
destroyed by gravitation. This
power only assists the agencies
of other causes of degradation
attraction of whatever kind tends
as it were to produce rest -
a sort of eternal sleep in nature.
The great [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]antagonist power

[page]166|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00166|dnp14a166pp|92018228[/page]
is [underline]heat[/underline]. By the influence of the
Sun the globe is exposed to
great varieties of temperature;
an addition of heat expands
bodies & an abstraction of heat
causes them to contract. By
variations of heat certain kinds
of matter are rendered fluid
or elastic & changes from fluids
into solids, or from solids or
fluids into elastic substances
& vice versa are produced; - &
all these phenomena are con-
nected with alterations tending
to the decay or destruction of
bodies. It is not probable that
the mere contraction or expansion
of a solid from the substraction
or addition of heat tends to
loosen its' parts; but if water
exists in these parts then it's
expansion either in becoming
vapour or ice tends not only
to diminish their cohesion,

[page]167|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00167|dnp14a167pp|92018229[/page]
167
but to break them into fragments.
There is you know a [insertion]very[/insertion] remarkable
property of water,- it's expansion
by cooling & at the time of
becoming ice, - and this is a
great cause of destruction in
the northern climates, for
where ice forms in the crevices
or cavities of stones, or when
water which has penetrated
into cement freezes it's
expansion acts with the force of
the lever or the screw in destroying
or separating the parts of bodies.
The mechanical powers of water
as rain, hail or snow in
descending from the atmosphere
are not entirely without effect
for in acting upon the projections
of solids, drops of water or
particles of snow & still more
of hail have a power of abrasion
& a very soft substance from
it's mass assisting gravitation

[page]168|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00168|dnp14a168pp|92018230[/page]
may break a much harder one.
The glacier by it's motion
grinds into powder the surface
of the granite rock & the alpine
torrents that have their origin
under glaciers are always
turbid from the destruction of
the rocks on which the glacier
is formed. The effect of a torrent
in deepening it's bed will explain,
the mechanical agency of fluid
water, tho' this effect is infinitely
increased & sometimes almost
entirely dependent upon the
solid matters which are carried
down by it. An angular fragment
of stone in the course of ages
moved in the cavity of a rock
makes a deep round excavation
& is worn itself into a spherical
form. - A torrent of rain flowing
down the side of a building
carries with it the silicious
dust or sand or matter

[page]169|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00169|dnp14a169pp|92018231[/page]
169
which the wind has deposited there
& acts upon a scale infinitely
more minute, but according to
the same law. The buildings of
ancient Rome have not only
been liable to the constant
operation of the rain courses
or ancient torrents [deletion]prod[/deletion] produced
by rains, but even the Tiber
swollen with the floods of the
Sabine mountains & the
appenines has often entered into
the city & a winter seldom
passes away in which the area
of the [place]place_1411|Pantheon[/place] has not been
filled with water & the re-
flection of the cupola seen
in a smooth lake below. The
monuments of Egypt are perhaps
the most antient & permanent of
those belonging to the earth & in
that country rain is unknown.
And all the causes of depredation
connected with the agency of

[page]170|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00170|dnp14a170pp|92018232[/page]
water act more in the temperate
climates than in the hot ones &
most of all in those countries
where the inequalities of temperature
are greatest. The mechanical
effects of air are principally in
the action of winds in assisting
the operation of gravitation & in
abrading by dust, sand, stones &
atmospheric water. These effects
unless it be in the case of a
building blown down by a tempest
are imperceptible in days or
even years; - yet a gentle current
of air carrying the silicious sand
of the desert or the dust of a road
for ages against the face of a
structure must ultimately tend
to injure it, for with infinite
or unlimited duration, an extreme
ly small cause will produce a
very great effect.
The mechanical agency of electricity
is very limited: The effects of
lightning have however been
witnessed even in some of the

[page]171|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00171|dnp14a171pp|92018233[/page]
171
great monuments of antiquity; the
Colosceum at Rome for instance;
& only last year in a violent
thunder storm some of the marble
I have been informed was struck
from the top of one of the arches
in this building & a perpendicular
rent made of some feet in
diameter. But the chemical effects
of electricity - tho' excessively slow
& gradual yet are much more
efficient in the great work of
destruction. It is to the general
chemical doctrines of the changes
produced by this powerful agent
that I must now direct your
especial attention.
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. - Would not the consider
ation of the subject have been
more distinct & your explanations
of the phenomena more simple
had you commenced by dividing
the causes of change into mechanical
& chemical, - if you had first
considered them separately & then
their

[page]172|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00172|dnp14a172pp|92018234[/page]
joint effects? -
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- The order I have
adopted is not very remote from
this;- but I was perhaps wrong
in treating first of the agency
of gravitation which over almost
all it's powers to the operation of
other causes. In consequence of
your hint I shall alter my
plan a little & consider first
the chemical agency of water
than that of air & lastly that
of electricity.-
In every species of chemical
change temperature is concerned
but unless the results of volcanos
& earthquakes be directly referred
to this power, it has no [underline]chemical[/underline]
effect in relation to the changes
ascribed to Time simply con-
sidered as heat but it's operations
which are the most important
belonging to the terrestrial cycle
of changes are blended with or
bring into activity those of other
agents. One of the most distinct

[page]173|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00173|dnp14a173pp|92018235[/page]
173
& destructive agencies of water
depends upon it's [underline]solvent[/underline] powers
which are usually greatest when
it's temperature is highest. Water
is capable of dissolving in
larger or smaller proportion
most compound bodies & the
calcareous & alkaline elements
of stones are particularly liable
to this kind of operation. When
water holds in solution carbonic
acid, which is always the case
when it is precipitated from the
atmosphere, it's power of dissolving
carbonate of lime is very much
increased, & in the neighbourhood
of great cities, where the atmos-
phere contains a larger proportion
of this principle, the solvent
powers of rain upon the marble
exposed to it must be greatest.
Whoever examines the marble
statues in the [place]place_211|British Museum[/place]
which have been removed from
the exterior of the [place]place_1427|Parthenon[/place]
will be convinced that they

[page]174|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00174|dnp14a174pp|92018236[/page]
have suffered from this agency:-
& an effect distinct in the
pure atmosphere & temperate
climate of Athens must be
upon a higher scale on the
vicinity of other great European
cities where the consumption of
fuel produces carbonic acid
in large quantities. Metallic
substances such as iron, copper
bronze, brass, tin & lead whether
they exist in stones or are
used for support or connexion
in buildings are liable to be
corroded by water holding in
solution the principles of the
atmosphere &the rust & corrosion
which are made poetically
qualities of time depend upon
the oxydating powers of water
which by supplying oxygen in
a dissolved or condensed state
enables the metals to form new
combinations.- All vegetable
substances exposed to water &
air are liable to decay &

[page]175|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00175|dnp14a175pp|92018237[/page]
175
even the vapour in the air attracted
by wood, gradually reacts upon
it's fibres & assists decomposition
or enables it's elements to take
new arrangements;- hence, it is
that none of the roofs of ancient
buildings more than 1000 years
old remain, unless it be
such as are constructed of
stone as those of the Pantheon
of Rome & the [place]place_1408|tomb of Theodoric[/place]
at Ravenna the cupola of
which is composed of a single
block of marble. The pictures
of the Greek masters which
were painted on the wood of the
Abies or pine of the Mediterranean
likewise as we are informed
by [person]person_185|Pliny[/person] owed their destruction
not to a change in the colours,
not to the alteration of the
calcareous ground on which they
were painted, but to the decay
of the tablets of wood on which

[page]176|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00176|dnp14a176pp|92018238[/page]
the intonaco or stucco was laid.
Amongst the substances employed in
building, wood, iron, tin & lead
are most liable to decay from
the operation of water, than
marble when exposed to it's
influence in the fluid form,
brass, copper, granite, sienite
& porphyry are more durable,
but in stones, much depends
upon the peculiar nature of
their constituent parts.- When
the feldspar of the granite rocks
contains little alkali or
calcareous earth, it is a very
permanent stone, but when in
granite, porphyry, or sienite
either the feldspar contains
much alkaline matter, or
its mica, [chemical]chemical_290|shorl[/chemical], or hornblende
much protoxide of iron, the
action of water containing oxygen
& carbonic acid or the ferruginous
elements tends to produce the
disintegration of the stone. The

[page]177|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00177|dnp14a177pp|92018239[/page]
177
red granite, black sienite, &
red porphyry of Egypt which
ar e seen at Rome in pyramids,
columns & sarcophagi are
amongst the most durable compound
stones;- but the grey granites
of Corsica or Elba are
extremely liable to undergo
alteration, the feldspar
contains much alkaline matter
& [deletion]the[/deletion] the mica & schoerl much
protoxide of iron. A remarkable
instance of the decay of granite
may be seen in the hanging
tower of Pisa;- whilst the
marble pillar in the base-
meant remain scarcely altered,
the granite ones have lost a
considerable portion of their surface
which falls off continually in
scales & exhibits every where
stains from the formation of
peroxide of iron. The Kaolin or
clay used in most countries

[page]178|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00178|dnp14a178pp|92018240[/page]
for the manufacture of fine
porcelain or china is generally
produced from the feldspar
of decomposing granite in which
the cause of decay is the dissolution
& separation of the alkaline
ingredients
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] - I have seen serpentine
basalt & lavas which internally
were dark & which from their
weight I should suppose must
contain oxide of iron, superficially
brown or red & decomposing:
Undoubtedly this was from the
action of water impregnated with
air upon the ferruginous
elements.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown.[/underline][/person]- You are perfectly
right: There are few compound
stones possessing a considerable
specific gravity which are
not liable to change from this
cause of oxide of iron amongst
the [underline]metallic substances anciently[/underline]
[underline]known[/underline] is the most generally
diffused in nature & most
concerned in the changes which

[page]179|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00179|dnp14a179pp|92018241[/page]
179
take place on the surface of the
globe. The chemical action of
carbonic acid is so much con-
nested with that of water as
must be evident from what
I have before said that it is
scarcely possible to speak of
them separately, but the same
action which is exerted by
the elements of the acid dissolved
in water is likewise exerted
by them in their elastic state;
& in this case the facility
with which the quantity is
changed makes up for the
difference of the degree of
condensation.- The is no reason
to believe that the azote of
the atmosphere has any con-
siderable action in producing
changes of the nature we are
studying on the surface,- the
aqueous vapour, the oxygene
& the carbonic acid gas are
however constantly in combined

[page]180|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00180|dnp14a180pp|92018242[/page]
activity & above all the oxygen.
And whilst water uniting it's
effect with those of carbonic
acid tends to disintegrate the
parts of stone, the oxygen acts
upon vegetable matter. And
this great chemical agent is
at once necessary in all the
processes of life & in all those
of decay, in which nature
as it were taken again to
herself those instruments, organs
& powers which has for a while
been borrowed & employed for
the purpose or the wants of
the living principle. Almost
every thing effected by rapid
combinations in combustion may
also be effected gradually by
the slow absorption of oxygen;
& tho' the productions of the
animal & vegetable kingdom
are much more submitted to
the power of atmospheric agents

[page]181|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00181|dnp14a181pp|92018243[/page]
181
than those of the mineral kingdom
yet as in the instances which
have [insertion]just[/insertion] been mentioned, oxygene
gradually destroys the equilibrium
of the elements of stones & tends
to reduce into powder to render
fit for soils even the hardest
agregates belonging to our globe.-
Electricity as a chemical agent
may be considered not only as
directly producing an infinite
variety of changes but likewise
as influencing almost all that
take place. There are no two
substances on the surface of the
globe that are not in different
electrical relations to each
other; - &, chemical attraction
itself seems to be a peculiar
form of the exhibition of
electrical attraction; - & whenever
the atmosphere, or water or
any part of the surface of the
earth gains accumulated

[page]182|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00182|dnp14a182pp|92018244[/page]
electricity of a different kind from
the contiguous surfaces, the tendency
of this electricity is to produce
new arrangements of the parts of
those surfaces; - thus a positively
electrified cloud acting even
at a great distance on a
moistened stone tends to attract
it' s oxygeneous or acidiform
or acid ingredients; - & a
negatively electrified cloud has
the same effect upon it's earthy,
alkaline, or metallic matter:
& the silent & slow operation
of electricity is much more im-
portant in the economy of
nature than it's grand &
impressive operation in lightning
& thunder. -
The chemical agencies of water
& air are assisted by those
of electricity & their joint efforts
combined with those of gravitation
& the mechanical ones I first
described are sufficient to

[page]183|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00183|dnp14a183pp|92018245[/page]
183
account for the result of Time.
But the physical powers of
nature in producing decay are
assisted likewise by certain
agencies or energies of organized
beings. A polished surface of
a building or a statue is no
sooner made rough from the
causes that have been mentioned
than the seeds of lichens &
mosses which are constantly
floating in our atmosphere
make it a place of repose,
grow & increase & from their
death, their decay & decomposition
carbonaceous matter is produced
& at length a soil is formed in
which grass can fix it's roots.
In the crevices of walls where
this soil is washed down, even
the seeds of trees grow &
gradually as a building becomes
more ruined ivy & other
parasitical plants cover it.

[page]184|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00184|dnp14a184pp|92018246[/page]
Even the animal creation lends
it's aid to the work of destruction
when man no longer labours for
the conservation of his works.
The fox burrows amongst ruins,
bats & birds nestle in the
cavities in walls, the snake
& [place]place_293|the lizard[/place] likewise make
them their habitations. - Insects
act upon a smaller scale,
but by their united energies
sometimes produce great effect.
The ant by establishing her colony
& forming her magazines often
saps the foundation of the
strongest buildings, - & the
most insignificant creature
triumph as it were over the
the grandest works of man. Add
to these sure & slow operations
the devastations of war, the effects
of the destructive zeal of bigotry,
the predatory fury of barbarians
seeking for concealed wealth

[page]185|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00185|dnp14a185pp|92018247[/page]
185
under the foundations of buildings
and tearing from them every metallic
substance. & it is rather to be
wondered that any of the works
of the great nations of antiquity
are still in existence.
[underline]Philalethes[/underline] Your view of the
causes of devastation really is
a melancholy one; nor do I
see any remedy. The most imp-
portant causes will always oper-
ate; yet, suffering the constant
existence of a highly civilized
people, the ravages of time might
be repaired & by defending the
first works of art from the
external atmosphere their
changes would be scarcely per-
ceptible.-
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] I doubt much whether
it is for the interests of a people
that it's public works should
be of a durable kind. One of the
great causes of the decay of the
Roman Empire was, that the

[page]186|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00186|dnp14a186pp|92018248[/page]
people of the republic & of the
first Empire left nothing for
their posterity do: aqueducts,
temples, forums, every thing was
supplied & there were no objects
to [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] awaken activity; no
necessity to stimulate their
inventive faculties & hardly 
any wants to call forth their
industry. -
[person]person_122|[underline]The unknown.[/underline][/person] At least you must
allow the importance of preserving
objects of the fine arts. Almost
every thing we have worthy of
admiration is owing to what has
been preserved from the greek
school:- & the nations who
have not possessed these works
as models have made little
or no progress towards perfection;
nor does it seem that a mere
imitation of nature is sufficient
to produce the beautiful or
perfect - but the climate, the
manners, [deletion]the[/deletion] customs & dress

[page]187|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00187|dnp14a187pp|92018249[/page]
187
of [insertion]the[/insertion] people, its genius & taste
all cooperate in such principles of
conservation as Philathes has
referred to, are obvious:- no
works of excellence ought to be
exposed to the atmosphere: - & it
is a great object to preserve
them in apartments of equable
temperature & extremely dry. -
The roofs of magnificent buildings
shall be of materials not
likely to be dissolved by water
or changed by air. Many
electrical conductors should
be placed so as to prevent
the slow or the rapid effects
of atmospheric electricity. In
painting lapis lazuli, or
coloured hand glasses in which
the oxides are not liable to
change should be used &
should be laid in marble
or stucco incased in stone &
no animal or vegetable substances

[page]188|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00188|dnp14a188pp|92018250[/page]
except pure carbonaceous matter
should be used either in the
pigments or in the varnishes.-
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] - Yet when all is done
that can be done in the work of
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] conservation, it is only
producing a difference in the
degree of duration;- & from the
statements that our friend has
made, it is evident, that more
of the works of a mortal being
can be eternal, as none of the
combinations of a limited intellect
can be infinite.- The operations
of nature when slow are no less
sure; however man may for
a time usurp dominion over her
She is certain of recovering her
empire. He converts her rocks,
her stones, her trees into forms
of palaces, houses & ships. He
employs the metals found in
the bosom of the earth as in-
struments of power & the sands &
clays which constitute it's

surface as ornaments & resources
of luxury. - He imprisons air
by water & tortures water by
fire to change or modify or
destroy the natural forms of
things. - But in some lustrums or
olympiads his works begin to
change & in a few centuries
they decay & are destroyed: &
his mighty temples framed as
it were for immortal &
divine purposes, & his bridges
formed of granite & ribbed
with iron, & his walls for
defence, & the splendid instr-
aments by which he has
endeavoured to give eternity
even to his perishable remains
are gradually destroyed, &
those structures which have
resisted the waves of the ocean
the tempests of the sky & the
stroke of the lightning, shall
yield to the operation of the

[page]190|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00190|dnp14a190pp|92018252[/page]
dews of heaven, of frost, rain
vapour & imperceptible atmospheric
influences & as the worm devours
the lineaments of his mortal
beauty, so the lichens & the
moss & the most insignificant
plants shall feed upon his
columns & [insertion]his[/insertion] pyramids: - & the
most humble & insignificant
insects shall undermine &
sap the foundations of his
colossal works, & make their
habitations amongst
ruins of his palaces & the
falling seats of his earthly
glory.-

conclusion of the 6[superscript]th[/superscript] Dialogue
written Feb. 23
[underline]Philelethes[/underline].- Your history of the
laws of the inevitable destruction
of material forms accede to
to my memory our discussion
at Adelsberg.- The changes of the
material universe are in
harmony with those which belong
to the human body & which you
suppose to be the frame or
machinery of the sentient
principle. May we not venture
to imagine that the visible
& tangible world with which
we are acquainted by our
sensations, bear the same
relation to the divine & infinite
Intelligence that our organs
have to our mind, with this
only difference that in the
changes of the divine system
there is no decay, there being
in the order of things a perfect

[page]192|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00192|dnp14a192pp|92018254[/page]
unity & all the powers springing
from one will,- & being a consequence
of that will, are perfectly &
unalterably balanced.- Newton
seemed to apprehend that in
the laws of the planetary motion,
there was a principle which
would ultimately be the cause
of the destruction of the system.
La Place by pursuing & refining
the principles of our great
philosopher has found that
what appeared sources of disorder
are in fact the perfecting machinery
of the system & that the principle
of conservation is as eternal
as that of motion.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- I dare not offer
any speculations on this grand
& awful subject.- We can hardly
comprehend the cause of a simple
atmospheric phenomena such
as the pull of a heavy body from
a meteor. - We cannot even
embrace in our view the
a motion.- We cannot even

[page]193|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00193|dnp14a193pp|92018255[/page]
193
millionth part of the objects
surrounding us, & yet we have
the presumption to reason upon
the infinite universe & the
eternal mind by which it
was created & governed.- on
these subjects I have no confidence
in reason, I trust only to
faith & as far as we ought
to inquire we have no other
guide but revelation.
[underline]Philalethes[/underline].- I agree with you
that whenever we attempt
metaphysical speculations we
must begin with a foundation
of faith. - And being sure
from revelation that God is
omnipotent & omnipresent, it
appears to me no improper use
of our faculties to trace even
in the natural universe, the
acts of his power & the results
of his wisdom & to draw
parallels from the infinite to

[page]194|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00194|dnp14a194pp|92018256[/page]
to the finite mind. Remember
we are taught that man was
created in the image of God.-
& I think it cannot be doubted
that in the progress of society
man has been made a great
instrument by his energies &
labours for improving the moral
universe.- Compare the Greeks
& Romans with the Assyrians
& Babylonians;- & the ancient
Greeks & Romans with the
nations of modern Christendom
& it cannot I think be questioned
that there has been a great
superiority in the latter nations
& that their improvements have
been subservient to a more
exalted state of intellectual
& religious existence. If this
little globe has been so
modified by it's powerful &
active inhabitants I cannot
help thinking, that in other

[page]195|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00195|dnp14a195pp|92018257[/page]
195
systems, beings of a superior
nature under the influence of
the divine will may act nobler
parts. - We know from the
sacred writings that there are
intelligences of a higher nature
than man & I cannot help
sanctions referring to my
vision in the Colosseum & in
suffering some acts of power
by these Genii or Seraphs
similar to those which I
imagined in the higher
planetary systems. There is
much reason to suppose [insertion]believe infer[/insertion] from
astronomical observations that
great changes take place in
the system of the fixed stars,
In William Herschel indeed
seems too have believed that
he saw nebulous or luminous
matter in the process of forming
suns; - & there are some
astronomers who believe that

[page]196|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00196|dnp14a196pp|92018258[/page]
stars have been extinct, but
it is more probable that they
have disappeared from peculiar
motions.- It is perhaps rather
a practical than a philosophical
idea, yet I cannot help forming
the opinion, that genii or
seraphic intelligences may
inhabit these systems &
may be the ministers of the
eternal mind in producing
changes in them similar to
those which have taken place
on the earth. Time is almost
a human word & change
entirely a human idea. In
the system of nature we
should rather say progress
than change. The sun appears
to sink in the ocean in
darkness, but it rises in another
hemisphere. Th ruins of a city
fall, but they are often used
to form more magnificent

structures, as at Rome, but
even when they are destroyed so
as to produce only dust,
nature asserts her empire
over tem & the vegetable world
rises in constant youth &
in a period of annual successions,
by the labours of man providing
food, vitality & beauty upon
the wreck of monuments which
were once raised for purposes
of glory, but which are now
applied [underline]to objects[/underline] of utility
Another [underline]addition[/underline] March 3[superscript]d[/superscript].-
[person]person_122|[underline]The unknown.[/underline][/person]- In the laws &
ordinances of nature we
continually catch gleams of
that divine light, which for
ever shines even in the
darkest & most obscure clouds
that envelope sensible images
but when the moral [deletion]& physical[/deletion]

& the physical world are as
it were blended together in the
operations of man, it is much
more difficult to be secure
on the ultimate results of the
improvements or changes produced
in the system of things - & even
when we reason most deeply on
these subjects I place very little
confidence in the refinements of
human wisdom. -
[underline]Eubathes[/underline].- I am surprised at
this your last opinion for surely
in the actual state of human
society & in such questions as
we are now discussing reason
is almost our only guide.-
[person]person_122|[underline]The Unknown[/underline][/person].- We have a still
surer guide in the written records
of revelation & when I consider
the singular results of human
reason, I can hardly sometimes
help entertaining the idea that
man with his boasted
[deletion]reason[/deletion] faculty was as it
were eventual to be the sport of

[page]199|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00199|dnp14a199pp|92018261[/page]
199
some superior intelligence, so
vague are often his combinations,
so erring his results.- Our reason
teaches us to defend ourselves from
the cold by decent coverings made
of animal or vegetable materials,
but look at the infinity of
absurd ornaments with which
man has adorned his person
& has weighed himself down by
gold & silver ornaments &
[insertion]d[/insertion]angled as it were constellations
at his button holes. He despises
the useful cloth which defends
him from the inclememcy of the
seasons & attaches infinite
importance to a bit of silver
stuff which he wears upon
his breast or which gives him
an air of importance & dignity.
With respect to houses they
are the inventions of a pure
reason to defend man against
the influence of the atmosphere

[page]200|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00200|dnp14a200pp|92018262[/page]
& of the sun; yet look at those
combinations which he has made
it his glory to form & build for
the most vain & idle purposes & many
of the glorious structures of anti-
quity have been intended only
to contain the dead & corrupting
remains & the pyramids of
Egypt, works built as it were
for eternity to prove to us only
the vain glory of some unknown
tyrant belonging to some unknown
race. - When I think of the various
effects of this faculty which you
call divine, I am put in mind
of the combinations which I
have sometimes had in the delirium
of fever when majestic edifices
appeared newly raised from
the ground amongst the ruins
of a decayed & worn out city
temples & places amidst the
clouds & a glorious colonade
ornamented with the most
beautiful statues & pictures

201
amidst the ruins, the dust &
the decay of the meanest &
most busy part of the modern
metropolis of the world. -
[underline]Philalethes.[/underline] - I have sometimes had
the same idea that you have
just expressed & have often
fancied that man is but a
sport or just of some loftier
intelligence, as if produced rather
to show the power & benevolence
than the perfect wisdom of the
eternal mind, a sort of creative
sport of divine energy, - for
in all the other productions
belonging to the globe there
are fixed & simple laws
which always produce their
results uniformly & according to
an invariable order. But reason
which is considered as the
highest gift of heaven acting
upon the passions of man lead
to result the most extraordinary

[page]202|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00202|dnp14a202pp|92018264[/page]
& unexpected. Man is made without
clothing & no sooner has he discover
ed means of defending himself
from the external elements as
you have observed than he
instantly creates useless forms
& finery & tortured his organs
into the most uncouth shapes
to gratify certain capricious
ideas of fashion & beauty
Th first display of reason in
New South Wales is that the
savage extracts one of his
fine teeth. - In another country
the whole skin is cut & pickled
In China the women squeeze
their feet into miniature shoes
& torture themselves more than
if they went bare footed &
in England men compress
themselves in stays. Painting
the skin with noxious substances
is another effect of reason.-

203
Beasts fight animated by the
passion of love & the strongest
perpetuate the species. Men fight
& destroy each other without
being animated by any passion
at all but because persons
whom they support by their
labour & who never do anything
in nature quarrel about
some spot of land, or some
river, or some desert which
is of no importance whatever
to the combatants.-
[underline]Eubathes[/underline] - You are both I
thank adopting a tone of irony
too severe & sarcastic for
real philosophers & Christians
your modes or treating this
subject are similar to those
of [person]person_1116|Swift[/person] who whilst he injured
the cause of reason did not
exalt that of revelation. Even
with respect to these errors of
man which you have so strikingly

[page]204|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00204|dnp14a204pp|92018266[/page]
illustrated there is a principle
which has relations to the better
& more exalted part of his
nature, & I have heard you
both deduce arguments in favour
of the immortality of the
sentient principle from our
vain aspirations from glory on
this earth & for the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of
an undying name.- Then all
distinctions have more or
less connection with [underline]this[/underline] love
of glory, & tho' it is better to
merit honours & not to
possess them than to possess
them & not to merit them,
yet still, exalted minds
will always thirst more or
less for those higher marks of
respect which must always
be valued by the multitude as
flowing from the loftiest sources
emperors & kings, the representatives
of divine majesty on Earth.-

[page]205|MS-DAVY-11401-000-00205|dnp14a205pp|92018267[/page]
205
I agree with you both, that we
must wait for the end of this
terrestrial scene before we
can really judge of the nature
& objects of the characters
who have acted in the drama
of life & we may be mistaken
[deletion]sev[/deletion] even in the most probable
opinions that may be formed,
for we can know nothing of the
new scene which is to open
upon us when the curtain
falls except from revelation
but we know that it will
be a glorious scene in which
pure moral & religious natures
will be more highly exalted
- a scene in which rewards
will be bestowed according to
the decrees of eternal justice
flowing from the source of
eternal love.-
