guided by infinite wisdom, all low<lb/>

around him by understanding them &amp;<lb/>
gaining as it were a kind of dominion<lb/>

Whilst chemical pursuits, exalt the<lb/>
understanding, they do not depress the<lb/>
imagination or weaken genuine feeling.<lb/>
Whilst they give the mind habits of<lb/>
accuracy by obliging it to attend to<lb/>
facts, they likewise extend its analogies<lb/>
&amp; though conversant with the minutest<lb/>
forms of things, they have for their<lb/>
ultimate end the great &amp; magnificent<lb/>
objects of nature. They regard the formation<lb/>
of a chrystal, the structure of a pebble,<lb/>
the nature of a clay or earth, &amp; they apply<lb/>
to the causes of the diversity of our<lb/>
mountain chains, the appearances of the<lb/>
winds, thunderstorms, meteors, the earthquake<lb/>
the volcano, &amp; all those phenomena which<lb/>
offer the most striking images to the<lb/>

that unextinguishable thirst after knowledge<lb/>

new acquisition of facts &amp; news as the<lb/>
imperfection of our theories. It has justly<lb/>
been said, that the greater the circle of<lb/>
light, the greater the boundary of darkness<lb/>

its unceasing efforts to acquire a higher<lb/>

as it were to demonstrate its birthright<lb/>
to immortality.<lb/>

advancement of the science, Amongst<lb/>
them, patience, industry &amp; neatness in<lb/>
manipulation, &amp; accuracy &amp; minuteness<lb/>
in observing and registering the phenomena<lb/>
they present, are essential. A steady<lb/>
hand &amp; a quick eye are most useful<lb/>
auxiliaries, but there have been very<lb/>

these advantages through life; for the<lb/>

a vague than an accurate manner of<lb/>
expressing the results of observations. Minute<lb/>
division &amp; an approach to contact must<lb/>
always precede the exertion of chemical<lb/>
attraction; &amp; the two most important<lb/>
circumstances respecting it are, that it<lb/>
generally unites bodies in certain uniform<lb/>
or definite proportions, &amp; that it is exerted<lb/>
by different bodies with different degrees<lb/>
of force; so that one body is capable of<lb/>
attracting another from a compound, &amp; of<lb/>
separating the original facts of the combination<lb/>

connected, with that class of sensations<lb/>

more than that the sensation of vision<lb/>
is connected with certain other sensations<lb/>
The sensation itself I suppose to be<lb/>
composed of indestructible parts, which<lb/>
in their aggregate produce the effects.<lb/>
I appears to me absurd to talk of<lb/>
something which is not thought producing<lb/>

the arguments I have just heard<lb/>
I will not allow any facts or<lb/>
laws from the action of dead<lb/>
matter to apply to living structures<lb/>
The blood is a living fluid &amp; of<lb/>
this we are sure that it does<lb/>
not<del xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                 rend="strikethrough">burn</del> in respiration. -<lb/>
The terms warm &amp; cold<lb/>
as applied to the blood of<lb/>
animals are improper in<lb/>
the sense in which they have<lb/>
been just used. All animals<lb/>
are in fact warm blooded<lb/>

I could mention a thousand<lb/>

            </del>
            <lb/>
animal matter. This general<lb/>
fact which may be almost<lb/>
called a Law is in favour<lb/>
of the view of <rs xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"
                xml:id="ttag450"

Another circumstance in favour<lb/>
of it is that those animals<lb/>
which possess the highest temperature<lb/>
consume the greatest quantity<lb/>

circumstances of action &amp; repose<lb/>
their heat is in great measure<lb/>
proportional to the quantity<lb/>
