marshalled that army which had nearly
deprived Rome of Empire, is now of
a beautiful queen from the rising corn
Here the Tiber runs a clear & bright
blue mountain stream - meriting the
epithet of ceruleus bestowed upon it by
Virgil and there the Chiusan marsh
sends its tributary steams from the
same level to the rivers of Etruria
& Latium. In the extreme distance
are the woods of the Sabine country
bright with the purple foliage of the
Judah tree, extending along the sides
of blue hills which again are capped
by snowy mountains. How rich & noble
is the scene! How vast its extent! How
diversified its colours!
