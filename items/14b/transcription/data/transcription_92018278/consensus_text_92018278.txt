decomposition are far from having reached
their [underline]ultimatum[/underline]; yet in the operations
of nature, as well as in those of art,
Certain substances appear to be unchangeable
Thus, if we take a metal such as iron, and
dissolve it in a acid, or sublime it in
union with an elastic fluid, or make
it enter into a hundred combinations,
it may still be recovered unaltered in
its properties, the same in substance
and in quantity. The test of a body being
indecomposable is, that in all chemical
changes it increases in weight, or its
changes result from its combining with
new matter. Thus when mercury is
converted into a red powder by being
heated in the air, it gains in weight.
