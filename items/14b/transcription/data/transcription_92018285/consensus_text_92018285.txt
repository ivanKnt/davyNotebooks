of spherical molecules regular solids
are formed; & that the molecules have
certain attractive & repulsive powers which
correspond to negative & positive electricity
this is not mere supposition unsupported
by experiments; these are various facts
which give probability to the idea, which
I shall now state to you. The [underline]first[/underline]
[underline]fact[/underline] is, that all bodies are capable
of being rendered fluid by a certain
degree of heat, which supposes a freedom
of motion in their particles that cannot
be well explained except by supposing
them spherical in the fluid state.
The [underline]second[/underline] fact is, that all bodies in
becoming solid are capable of assuming
regular [insertion]polyedral[/insertion] forms, [deletion]which could not happen[/deletion]
