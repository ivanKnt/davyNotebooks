done in comparatively [deletion]xxxxxxxxx[/deletion] [insertion]little[/insertion]. The beginning
of civilization is the discovery of some
useful acts by which men acquire proper
comforts or luxuries. The necessity or desire
of preserving their leads to laws & social
institutions. The discovery of peculiar acts
gives superiority to particular nations; & the
love of power induces them to employ this
superiority to subjugate other nations, who
learn their acts & ultimately adopt their man
so that in reality, the origin as well as the
progress & revolutions of civil society is found
in mechanical & chemical inventions. No
people have ever arrived at any degree of
perfection in their institutions who have not
possessed in a high degree the useful &
refined arts. The comparison of savage &
civilized man in fact demonstrates the
triumph of chemical & mechanical philosophy
