is a double reason offered for pursuing them
for whilst in their sublime speculation they
reach to the heavens, in their application
they belong to the earth; whilst they
[insertion]exalt the intellect they[/insertion] provide food for our own common wants &
likewise minister to the noblest appetites
& most exalted views belonging to our
nature. The results of this science are
not like the temples of the ancients in which
statues of the Gods were placed, where incense
was offered & sacrifices were performed, &
which were presented to the adoration of
the multitude, founded upon superstitious
feelings; but they are rather like the palaces
of the moderns, to be admired & used; &
where the statues which in the ancients
raised feelings of adoration and awe, now produce
only feelings of pleasure & gratify a
refined taste. -
