It is surely a pure delight to know how
& by what processes this earth is clothed
with verdure and life: how the clouds,
mists & rain are formed: what causes
all the changes of this terrestrial system
of things; & by what Divine laws, order
is preserved amidst apparent confusion
It is a sublime occupation to investigate
the cause of the tempest & the volcano &
to point out their use in the economy of
things. To bring the lightning from the
clouds & make it subservient to our
experiments; to produce as it were a
microcosm in the laboratory of art; &
to measure and weigh those invisible atoms
which by their motions & changes according
to laws impressed upon them by Divine
intelligence, constitute the universe of things.
