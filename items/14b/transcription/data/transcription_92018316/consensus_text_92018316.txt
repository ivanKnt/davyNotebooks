The true chemical philosopher sees good
in all the diversified forms & appearances
of the external world. Whilst he
investigate the operations of infinite power
guided by infinite wisdom, all low
prejudices, all mean superstitions disappear
from his mind. He sees man an atom
amidst atoms fixed upon a point in
space & yet modifying the laws that act
around him by understanding them &
gaining as it were a kind of dominion
over time & an empire in material space
& exerting on a scale infinitely small, a
power, seeming a sort of shadow or
reflection of a creative energy, & which
entitles him to the distinction of being
made in the image of God laminated
by a spark of the Divine Mind.
