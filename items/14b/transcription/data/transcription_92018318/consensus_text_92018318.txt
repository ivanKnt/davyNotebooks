that unextinguishable thirst after knowledge
which is one of the grandest characteristics
of our nature: for every new discovery
opens a new field for investigation: every
new acquisition of facts & news as the
imperfection of our theories. It has justly
been said, that the greater the circle of
light, the greater the boundary of darkness
by which it is surrounded. This strictly
applies to chemical enquiries, & hence they
are wonderfully suited to the progressive
nature of the human intellect - which by
its unceasing efforts to acquire a higher
kind of wisdom & a state in which
truth is fully & brightly revealed, seems
as it were to demonstrate its birthright
to immortality.
