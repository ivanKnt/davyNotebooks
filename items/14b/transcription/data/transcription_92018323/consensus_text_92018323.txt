& to Algebra than to Geometry, but
all these sciences lend their aid to
Chemistry. Arithmetic in determining
the proportions of analytical results
& the relative weights of the elements
of bodies. Algebra in ascertaining
the laws of the pressure of elastic fluids
the force of vapours as dependent upon
temperature; & the effects of masses
& surfaces on the communication &
radiation of [underline]heat[/underline]. The applications of
Geometry are principally limited to the
determination of the chrystalline forms
of bodies, which form the most important
type of their nature, & often offer important
hints for analytical researches respecting
their composition. The first principles
of natural philosophy & general physics
