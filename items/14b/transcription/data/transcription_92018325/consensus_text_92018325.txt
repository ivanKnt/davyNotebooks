[insertion]to[/insertion] [deletion]for[/deletion] the modern [deletion]chemist[/deletion] [insertion]Chemical Philosopher[/insertion] is much less bulky
& expensive than that used by the ancients
An air pump, an electrical machine
a voltaic battery, (all of which may
be upon a small scale) a blowpipe
apparatus, a beloows & forge, a mercurial
& water gas apparatus, cups & basins of
platina & glass & the common reagents
of chemistry are what are required.
All the implements absolutely necessary
may be carried in a small trunk:
& some of the best & most refined
researches of modern chemists have been
made by means of apparatus which
might with ease be contained in a
small travelling carriage, & the expense
of which is only a few pounds.
