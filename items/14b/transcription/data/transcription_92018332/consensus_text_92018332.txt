should [deletion]remember[/deletion] [insertion]resemble[/insertion] the modern geometrician
in the greatness of his views & the
profoundness of his researches & the

Providence as was the custom of
[underline]Peter Wolfe[/underline] the last of the Alchemical
school, & who was alive in my early
days; but his mind should always
awake to devotional feeling; & in contemplating
the variety & the beauty of the external
world & in developing its scientific
wonders he will always refer to that
