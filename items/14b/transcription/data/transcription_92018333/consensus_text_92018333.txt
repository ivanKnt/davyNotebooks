infinite wisdom through whose beneficence
He is permitted to enjoy knowledge,
& in becoming wiser he will become better
he will rise at once in the scale
of intellectual & moral existence & his

to a more exalted faith; & in proportion
as the veil becomes thinner through
which he sees the causes of things,
he will admire more the brightness of
the light by which they are made visible
