the scene below! - The rich field covered
with flax or maize or millet, & interested
by rows of trees which serve as the
standards of the vine [deletion]tree[/deletion]. The orange
& lemon glow in the sheltered glen;
the olive tree rises on the hills, Islands
purple in the beams of the setting Sun
are scattered over the sea in the west,
tinted with red which softens into the
brightest azure. The distant mountains
still retain a part of the snow of winter,
but it is now melting, & it absolutely
seems to melt under the setting Sun,
glowing as if on fire. And man seems
emulous of nature; for the city below
is full of activity: the nearest part
of the bay is covered with boats
