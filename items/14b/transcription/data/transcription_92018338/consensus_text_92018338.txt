When you study it in detail, you
will hardly avoid the Museum of
believing that it is a rising city. You
will almost be tempted to ask where
are the workmen, so perfect are the walls
of the houses, so bright & uninjured the
paintings upon them, so fresh the marble
of the columns of its Temples; Hardly
any thing is wanting to make this
scene a magnificent epitome of all that
is most worthy of admiration in nature
& art: had there been in addition to
the other objects a fine river & a waterfall
the epitome had been complete
