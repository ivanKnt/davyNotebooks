test of weight; the last we know
only by their effects. The most
important power belonging to matter, is
attraction. this in the systems of
the universe preserves the parts of the
fixed stars, the sun & the [deletion]fixed[/deletion] planets
in their relative positions, & it is the
prince cause or governing principle of
all our terrestrial changes. When it
acts in masses, as you well [insertion]aware[/insertion] know, it is
known by the name of [underline]gravitation[/underline];
when it preserves the [deletion]structure[/deletion] [insertion]composition[/insertion] of a solid
or [deletion]the composition[/deletion] of a fluid, it is
called [underline]chemical attraction.[/underline] It is the
same power whether it unites alkaline
earth together in glass, or causes the
solution of salt or sugar in water.
