but the correctness of many of these
propositions as they are usually detailed
may be questioned; & they present rather
a vague than an accurate manner of
expressing the results of observations. Minute
division & an approach to contact must
always precede the exertion of chemical
attraction; & the two most important
circumstances respecting it are, that it
generally unites bodies in certain uniform
or definite proportions, & that it is exerted
by different bodies with different degrees
of force; so that one body is capable of
attracting another from a compound, & of
separating the original facts of the combination
Pol. Will you be so good as to illustrate
these circumstances?
