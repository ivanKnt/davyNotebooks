The yellow oxide of lead contains exactly
half as much more oxygen than the white
oxide; the oxygen in one being
that in the other. In consequence
of these facts, the proportions in which
each decompounded body combines may
be expressed by a number; & by these
numbers all possible combinations may
be represented. Thus parts of oxygen
combine with one of sulphur, & one of
sulphur with of iron; & of iron
as you have heard with of
oxygene, & so on in all other cases;
& a beautiful simplicity is given to
Chemistry, which no longer appears a

as an exact science to which weight &
number may be applied, & of which the
