results may be submitted to calculation
The fact of the combination of bodies
in definite proportions has led to the revival
of that ancient doctrine of the Greek
School attributed to Democritus, that
the real elements of bodies are certain
indestructible particles or atoms, from the
arrangements of which in various forms
& combinations all the varieties of matter
result. This doctrine which in its
application to Chemistry has been called
the [underline]atomic doctrine[/underline], or theory, has been
embraced by several modern Chemists;
but the development of it is owing to
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton, who seems to have been the
first person to generalize the facts of
Chemistry relating to definite proportions
& to draw this inference from them.
