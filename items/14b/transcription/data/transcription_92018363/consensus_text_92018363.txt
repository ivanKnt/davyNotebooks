double combination of sulphur & iron
is not [deletion]attracted[/deletion] [insertion]acted on[/insertion] by diluted muriatic 
acid, though the iron is readily
separated from the sulphur by this
means in the single sulphruet: And
when one proportion of oxygen is
combined with one proportion of azote
as in nitrous gas, it is much more
readily attracted from it by combustible
bodies than when it is combined with
two proportions, as in nitrous oxide
a portion of lime from [unclear]Sulphosphate[/unclear] of
lime, or earth of bones, but is incapable
Separating the whole of the lime, so
as to leave the acid free; & there remains
a definite acid compound of lime & phosphoric
acid.
