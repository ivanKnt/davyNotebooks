may be, that the solution of potassa [deletion]must[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion]
capable of dissolving a small quantity
of Sulphate of Baryta: this view
Cannot be admitted even if he shews
that an [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] excess of Baryta remains
in the Sulphate; for then it may be
a phenomenon of double decomposition
in which water quits the hydrate of
potassa, to form with Sulphuric acid
& Baryta, a hydrate subsulphate of Baryta
& one portion of Sulphuric acid quits
the baryta to form a Subsulphate of
potassa. It cannot even be imagined
that chemical agents exert their attractive
powers at a distance, & when decomposition
take place in fluid menstrua, they usually
depend upon very complicated causes
