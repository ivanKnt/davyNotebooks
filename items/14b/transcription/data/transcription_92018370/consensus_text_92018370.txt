Phus. May not even the instance
which you just now quoted of the
Bisulphuret of iron not being acted
upon by diluted sulphuric acid, be
explained from a mechanical effect,
that the particles of the iron being [unclear]defend[/unclear]
by a larger quantity of sulphur are
not so much exposed to the contact
of the acid.
[unclear][underline]Phhi[/underline]l[/unclear]. Possibly the true solution of
all the phenomena of chemistry may

upon the primary attractive powers of
the corpuscles of matter influenced by
their forms & masses: but so simple

as that you have given will not
