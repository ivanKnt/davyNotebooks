I was at Hilstone house in
Monmouthshire I had a
letter from him dated London
begging me to come to him
as soon as I conveniently
could for he was ill.
In less than two days I
was with him & I found
him much worse than
I expected, - & labouring
under a paralytic
attack affecting the
right side. - It had
come on suddenly when
shooting at Lord Gages -
On his arrival in town,
where he hastened, he
had put himself under the
care of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Babington
