animals which [deletion]appear like new &[/deletion] [insertion]inhabit them[/insertion]
& which appear like new &

amidst a chaos, & recalling to mind
the fabled monsters produced from
the mud of the Nile. [deletion]A number

these immense excavations were formed,
& of what period; & whether the animals

or carried with the water & the mud
from some greater excavations or
whether they are perfect animals, or [unclear]animals[/unclear]
in the infant state.[/deletion]
