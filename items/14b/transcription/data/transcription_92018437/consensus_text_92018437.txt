[deletion]science[/deletion], these views are not unnaturally
applied to solve some of the mysteries
& recondite phenomena of organized
beings
[deletion]Phus.[/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] I conclude from what you
have last said, that though you are
inclined to believe that some unknown
[unclear]subtile[/unclear] matter is added to the organizing
system by respiration, yet you would
not have us believe that this is electricity
or that there is any reason to believe
that electricity has a peculiar & especial
share in producing the functions of life
Philo[superscript]s[/superscript] [insertion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion], I wish to guard you against
the adoption of any hypothesis on
this recondite & abstruse subject; but
however difficult it may be to refine
