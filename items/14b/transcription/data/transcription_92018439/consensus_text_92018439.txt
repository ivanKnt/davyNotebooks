not performed from the blood of the
mother, as in the mammalia by the
placenta, there is a system for
aerating as in the ova [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] viparous
reptiles or fishes, which enables the air
freely to pass through the receptacles
in which the eggs are deposited,
or the egg itself is aerated out of the
body through its coat or shells.
In the eggs of birds the air penetrates
through the shell; & when the air is
excluded, incubation or artificial
heat has no effect. Fishes which
deposit their eggs in water which
contains only a limited portion of air
make combinations which would seem
about the result of scientific knowledge
