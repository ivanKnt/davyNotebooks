rising in the atmosphere in a balloon
or sailing on the ocean, or penetrating
into space by optical inventions &
measuring worlds which he can never
reach, is in my opinion an object
somewhat nobler, than ten millions of
maggots, - even supposing them colossal,
feeding on mountains of cheese; or than
an universe of flies, feasting & propagating
upon carrion. A life in which no
faculties are employed but those [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
or generating, would approach to that
of an [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] [deletion]or[/deletion] polypus, or even a fungus
& it is only to suppose a simple kind
of perception concealed with the arrangement
of new parts, & the growth & seeding of a
flower, or the aggregation of a [unclear]chrystal[/unclear]]
