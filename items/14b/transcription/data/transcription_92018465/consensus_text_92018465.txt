[deletion]mathematical truths depend upon the[/deletion]
[deletion]signs which express them; but these[/deletion]
[deletion]signs themselves are not the truths[/deletion]
nor are the organs the mind. The
[deletion]whole history of intellect is a history[/deletion]
[deletion]of change, but change according to a[/deletion]
[deletion]certain law; & we retain the memory[/deletion]
[deletion]only of these changes which are useful [/deletion]
[deletion]to us, or connected with our future[/deletion]
[deletion]being. The child when born soon forgets[/deletion]
[deletion]what happened to it in the womb; all[/deletion]
[deletion]the recollections of the infant are lost,[/deletion]
[deletion]because they would be useless to an[/deletion]
[deletion]intellectual being; yet many of the[/deletion]
[deletion]habits acquired in that age are retained[/deletion]
[deletion]through life. When moral being begins[/deletion]
[deletion]in boyhood & youth, much is remembered[/deletion]
