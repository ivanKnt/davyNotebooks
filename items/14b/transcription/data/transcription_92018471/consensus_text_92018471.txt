[underline]Pol.[/underline] Your doctrine approaches to mi
for with the exception of a sentient
principle which you allow may sleep
or cease to be sentient; you make every
thing else dependent upon organs, & you
allow the new state of existence to be
entirely independent of this, as this was
of the last, so that all feelings, thoughts
habits, gained in this earth are lost for
heaven; & if we forget our past existence
we are in fact new beings; & unless
I remember that I was P. here, I might
as well be the soul of Caesar or Alexander
Moreover, as organs give powers, so they
give virtues or infirmities, & I cannot
imagine why the sentient principle
should be punished [deletion]for[/deletion] or rewarded for
what it could not command or avoid
