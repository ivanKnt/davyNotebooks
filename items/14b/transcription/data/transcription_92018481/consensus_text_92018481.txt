upon the projecting points of solids
drops of water, or particles of snow, &
still more of hail have a power of abrasion
and a very soft substance by its mass
assisting gravitation, may break a
much harder one. The glacier by its motion
grinds into powder the [insertion]surface of the[/insertion] granite rock
& the alpine torrents that have their
origin under glaciers are always
turbid from the destruction of the
rocks on which the glacier is formed
The effect of a torrent in deepening its
bed well shews the mechanical
agency of fluid water, though this
effect is infinitely increased & sometimes
almost entirely dependent upon the solid
matters which are carried down by it
