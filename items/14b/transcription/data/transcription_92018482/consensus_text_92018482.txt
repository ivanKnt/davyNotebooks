An angular fragment of stone in
the course of ages moved in the cavity
of a rock, makes a deep round
excavation, & its[insertion]2[/insertion]elf is [insertion]1[/insertion]worn into a
spherical form. A torrent of rain
flowing down the side of a building
carries with it the siliceous dust
or sand, or matter which the wind
has deposited there, & acts upon a scale
infinitely more minute, but according
to the same law. The buildings of
ancient Rome have not only been
liable to the constantly operation of
the [insertion]rain courses or minute[/insertion] torrents produced by rains; but
even the Tiber, swollen with the floods
of the Sabine Mountains & the Apennines
