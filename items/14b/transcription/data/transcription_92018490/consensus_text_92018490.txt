corrosion which are made poetically
qualities of time, depend upon the
oxydating powers of water; which
by supplying oxygene in a dissolved
or condensed state, enables the metals
to form new combinations.
All vegetable substances exposed to
water & air are liable to decay;
& even the vapour in the air, attracted
by wood, gradually reacts upon its
fibres & assists decomposition, or
enables its elements to take new
arrangements: hence it is that
none of the [underline]roofs[/underline] of ancient buildings
remain, unless it be those constituted
of stone, such as [insertion]those [deletion]that[/deletion]of[/insertion] the Pantheon of Rome
