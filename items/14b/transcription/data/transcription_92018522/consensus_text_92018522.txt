generation of creature powers
of that which [underline]is living[/underline]
& which only spring from [insertion]life[/insertion]
[deletion]which was living[/deletion].-

the breath of the Zephyr
awakened [deletion]life[/deletion][insertion]animation[/insertion] in forms
prepared[superscript]1[/superscript] to receive it [superscript]3[/superscript]
by divine intelligence [superscript]2[/superscript] -

the slumbering egg which came
to be vivified appeared like
the new born child, works
of a divine mind.
I saw [underline]love[/underline] as the creative
principle in the material
world: & this love only
