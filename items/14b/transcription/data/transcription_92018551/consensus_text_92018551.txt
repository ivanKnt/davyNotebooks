All the facts that you have
mentioned merely prove that
the organs are connected
with functions of thought
& that the brain is essential

sense of sight is lost
but the percipient principle
is not destroyed - When
a part of the brain is
injured: [deletion]the[/deletion] ideas of a
particular kind are destroyed
but the percipient principle
has no relation to this loss
