Another argument in favour of
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Blacks opinion is the change
of colour [deletion]from black[/deletion] in blood
from black to red which seems
to shew that it loses [underline]carbon[/underline] -
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. With the
highest respect for the memory
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black & for the opinions
of his disciple, I shall answer
the arguments I have just heard
I will not allow any facts or
laws from the action of dead
matter to apply to living structures
The blood is a living fluid & of
this we are sure that it does
not[deletion]burn[/deletion] in respiration. -
The terms warm & cold
as applied to the blood of
animals are improper in
the sense in which they have
been just used. All animals
are in fact warm blooded
