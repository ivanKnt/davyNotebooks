         <p>Daughter of Charles Kerr, an Antiguan merchant who made his fortune in highly dubious
            circumstances. Following his death she moved to Britain where she married Schukbrugh
            Apreece who died in 1807. After running a successful literary salon in Edinburgh she
            moved to London where she met Davy and they married on 11 April 1812 two days after
            he had been knighted by the Prince Regent.</p>
