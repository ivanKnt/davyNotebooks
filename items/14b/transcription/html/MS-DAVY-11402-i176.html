            <p>Polyp (Zoology) - a type of coral that reproduces asexually by the method of budding.
               In many cases the offspring buds do not seperate from the parent organism, giving
               the impression of a single organism which has auto-regenerative powers. This term
               was often used to describe any organism or paty of an organism which appeared to be
               able to regenerate parts of its form, such as earthworms.  </p>
