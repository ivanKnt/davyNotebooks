               importance from the 17th century to the 19th century, when it was commonly logged
               and exported to Europe for use in dyeing fabrics. Its extract was once used as a pH
               indicator which was brownish when neutral, turning yellow-red under acidic conditions
               and purple under alkaline ones. </p>
