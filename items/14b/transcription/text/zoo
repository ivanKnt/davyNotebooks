[insertion]Phil[/insertion] [deletion]Poet[/deletion] Notwithstanding the magnificence
of the Alpine country & the beauty of
the upper part of Italy, yet the scenery
now before us has peculiar charms, depend
not only upon the variety & grandeur of
the objects which it displays, but likew
upon its historical relations. The hills are
all celebrated in the early history of
Italy, & many of them are crowned by
Etruscan towns, the lake of Trasimene
spreads its broad & calm mirror beneath
a range of hills covered with oak &

deprived Rome of Empire, is now of
a beautiful queen from the rising corn
Here the Tiber runs a clear & bright
blue mountain stream - meriting the
epithet of ceruleus bestowed upon it by
Virgil and there the Chiusan marsh
sends its tributary steams from the
same level to the rivers of Etruria
& Latium. In the extreme distance
are the woods of the Sabine country
bright with the purple foliage of the
Judah tree, extending along the sides
of blue hills which again are capped
by snowy mountains. How rich & noble
is the scene! How vast its extent! How
diversified its colours!

[page]8||dnp14b004pp|92018275[/page]
Pol. The profusion of the rich tree which
renders the woods of so bright a colour
perhaps gave origin to the expression [underline]ver[/unclear]
[underline]Purpureum[/underline]
The Unknown
[underline][deletion]Philo.[superscript]s[/superscript][/deletion][/underline] The epithet purple will apply
with equal justice to the woods of Sabina
& the plains of Umbria, where the sain
foin gives the predominating tint, & it
is now in full & luxuriant blossom
the banks of the Clitumnus are as it
were lighted up by this brilliant colour
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]
[underline]Pol[/underline] Nature in this view is probably
nearly the same as it was 2000 years
ago; but [underline]how Man is changed[/underline]! -
improved in civilization, but enfeebled in
character. How unlike the ancient Umbrians

these mountains and vallies!
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]
[delete]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript][delete] The reason is obvious enough
Man is formed by his institutions, and
moral and political causes almost create
his character, Whereas [underline]nature[/underline] is governed
by fixed laws. The Atmosphere, the
the mountains, the vallies, the plains, the
degrees of heat and cold, with small differences
have continued the same, [insertion]385 S[/insertion] | & whether peopled
or deserted, this soil will always produce
fruits or flowers, wild or cultivated
[deletion]Poet.[/deletion] [insertion]Phil.[/insertion] If the exterior of the globe is
liable to only small changes, there must
be a permanency in the elements of
things; something give must be ideas unalterable
Will you give us some ideas [underline]Philochemicus[/underline]

[page]10||dnp14b006pp|92018277[/page]
respecting this part of your philosophy, -
which are the true elements of things?
if there be a permanency or constancy
in the arrangements of nature, matter
cannot be infinite either in its divisibility
or changes: pray give us some light on
these obscure and difficult matters.
The Unknown 
[deletion][underline]Philo[/underline][/deletion] I shall willingly enter upon this
subject. I cannot demonstrate to you
what are the true elements of things; but
I can exhibit to you those substances, which
as we cannot decompose them, are elementary
for us: mathematically considered, it appears
possible to prove the infinite divisibility of
matter; but our mechanical means of division
are extremely limited. There is every reason
to believe that our powers of chemical

[page]11||dnp14b007pp|92018278[/page]

Ed.
decomposition are far from having reached
their [underline]ultimatum[/underline]; yet in the operations
of nature, as well as in those of art,
Certain substances appear to be unchangeable
Thus, if we take a metal such as iron, and
dissolve it in a acid, or sublime it in
union with an elastic fluid, or make
it enter into a hundred combinations,
it may still be recovered unaltered in
its properties, the same in substance
and in quantity. The test of a body being
indecomposable is, that in all chemical
changes it increases in weight, or its
changes result from its combining with
new matter. Thus when mercury is
converted into a red powder by being
heated in the air, it gains in weight.

[page]12||dnp14b008pp|92018279[/page]
The test of a body being compound is,
that in assuming new forms it loses
weight; thus when the olive coloured substance
called oxide of silver is converted into
silver by heat, it weighs less than before
but in all cases either of gain or loss of
weight, the circumstance depends either
upon matter absorbed, or matter emitted
which is either solid, fluid, or aeriform
and which can be always collected and weighted
the metals, Sulphur, Phosphorous, Carbon,
Silenium, Iodine, Brome, & certain
elastic fluids are the only substances
[deletion]which[/deletion] as far as our knowledge extends
which can be neither produced from
other forms of matter, nor be converted
into them. I explained to you on a former

[page]13||dnp14b009pp|92018280[/page]

occasion that each of these substances
enters into combinations in the same
relative proportions, or in some multiple
of those proportions; and hence the idea
has been entertained that they are minute
indestructible particles, having always
the same figure and weight. The weights
of the smallest known relative proportions
of the undecomposable bodies are these
Hydrogene 1. Chlorine [insertion]35.47[/insertion] Oxygene [insertion]8[/insertion] 15

Phil.
[deletion]Poet.[/deletion] What is your idea of the cause
of this difference of weight. Do you
suppose their particles likewise of different
sizes, or that they are of the same size
and have a different quantity of pores, or size
that their figures are different?
The Unknown
[underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript][/underline] ]The question cannot be answered

[page]15||dnp14b011pp|92018282[/page]

except by conjectures. At some time
possibly we may be able to solve them
by an hypothesis which will satisfactorily
explain the chemical phenomena; but
as we can never see the elementary
particles of bodies, our reasoning upon
them must be founded upon analogies
derived from mechanics, & the idea
that small indivisible particles follow
the same laws of motion as the masses
which they compose.
Eubathes
[delete]Pol.[/delete] I think it is contrary to the
principles of sound philosophy to reason
in this way. In mathematics it is
always supposed that lines are composed
from points, surfaces from lines, solids
from surfaces; yet the elements bear

[page]16||dnp14b012pp|92018283[/page]
no relation to their compounds. Again
in light: according to your principle,
white light would be composed of many
particles, of white light; whereas analysis
proves it to be composed of various
coloured particles, each differing from
the other. On the hypothesis of
Boscovitch, which is well explained in
the [underline]Institutio Physica[/underline] of Mako
Matter, as well as I recollect, is supposed 
to be composed of indivisible points endowed
with attraction and repulsion, which are
assumed to be both physical & chemical
elements.
The Unknown
[deletion]Philo.[/deletion] You mistake me if you suppose
I have adopted a system like the
[underline]Homooia[/underline] of Anaxagoras, & that I suppose

[page]17||dnp14b013pp|92018284[/page]
7
the elements to be physical molecules
endowed with the properties of the bodies
we believe to be indecomposable. On the
contrary, I neither suppose in their
figure nor colour, - both would imply
a power of reflecting light: I consider
them with Bocovitch - merely as points
possessing weight & attractive & repulsive
powers, & composing according to the
circumstances of their arrangements either
spherules or regular solids, & capable
of assuming either one form or the
other, all that is necessary for the
doctrines of the corpuscular philosophy
is of suppose the molecules which we
are not able to decompose, Spherical
molecules, & that by the arrangement

[page]18||dnp14b014pp|92018285[/page]
of spherical molecules regular solids
are formed; & that the molecules have
certain attractive & repulsive powers which
correspond to negative & positive electricity
this is not mere supposition unsupported
by experiments; these are various facts
which give probability to the idea, which
I shall now state to you. The [underline]first[/underline]
[underline]fact[/underline] is, that all bodies are capable
of being rendered fluid by a certain
degree of heat, which supposes a freedom
of motion in their particles that cannot
be well explained except by supposing
them spherical in the fluid state.
The [underline]second[/underline] fact is, that all bodies in
becoming solid are capable of assuming
regular [insertion]polyedral[/insertion] forms, [deletion]which could not happen[/deletion]

[page]19||dnp14b015pp|92018286[/page]
8
[deletion]left then molecules arranged themselves[/deletion]
[deletion]polyedral form[/deletion] [underline]The third fact[/underline] is
that all c[deletion]h[/deletion]rystal[insertion]l[/insertion]ine bodies present
regular electrical poles. And the
[underline]fourth[/underline] is, that the elements of bodies
are capable of being separated from
each other by certain electrical attraction
& repulsions.

By introducing it into the Kitchen you
make it an act fundamental to all others.
But if what you had stated had been
really meant to be serious, it would not have
deserved a reply: As it is in mere playfullness
it shall not be thrown away. I want
eloquence, however to adorn my subject;
yet it is sufficiently exciting even to awaken
feeling. Persons in general look at the
magnificent fabric of civilized society as
a result of the accumulated labour, ingenuity
& enterprize of man through a long course
of ages without attempting to define what
his being owing to the different branches
of human industry & science, & usually
attribute to Politicians, Statesmen & Warriors
a much greater share than really belongs
to them in the work. What they have

[page]22||dnp14b018pp|92018289[/page]
done in comparatively [deletion]xxxxxxxxx[/deletion] [insertion]little[/insertion]. The beginning
of civilization is the discovery of some
useful acts by which men acquire proper
comforts or luxuries. The necessity or desire
of preserving their leads to laws & social
institutions. The discovery of peculiar acts
gives superiority to particular nations; & the
love of power induces them to employ this
superiority to subjugate other nations, who
learn their acts & ultimately adopt their man
so that in reality, the origin as well as the
progress & revolutions of civil society is found
in mechanical & chemical inventions. No
people have ever arrived at any degree of
perfection in their institutions who have not
possessed in a high degree the useful &
refined arts. The comparison of savage &
civilized man in fact demonstrates the
triumph of chemical & mechanical philosophy

[page]23||dnp14b019pp|92018290[/page]
19
as the causes not only of the physical, but
ultimately even of moral improvement. Look
at the condition of man in the lowest
state in which we are acquainted with
him. - take the nature of New Holland
Advanced only a few steps above the
animal creation, & that principally by
the use of fire; naked, defending himself
against wild beasts, or killing them for
food, only by weapons made of wood
hardened in the fire, or founded with
stones or fish bones; living only in holes
dug out of the earth, or in huts crudely
constructed of a few branches of trees
covered with grass; having no approach
to the enjoyment of luxuries, or even comforts
unable to provide for his most pressing
wants; having a language scarcely articulate
- relating only to the great objects of

[page]24||dnp14b020pp|92018291[/page]
nature or to his most pressing necessities
or desires; & living solitary or in single
families, unacquainted with religion
government, or laws, submitted to the
mercy of nature or the Elements. How
different is man in his highest state of
Cultivation. Every fact of his body covered
with the products of different chemical &
mechanical acts, - made not only useful
in protecting him from the inclemency of
the seasons, but combined in forms of being
& variety; Creating out of the dust of the earth
- from the clay under his feet, instruments
of comfort & luxury. Extracting metals
from the crude ore, & giving to them a
hundred different shapes for a thousand different
surfaces; selecting & improving the recyclable
productions with which the caves the earth

attribute to the fine arts - to letters; to
political improvement, & to those inventions

is a chemical invention, & that without
leather our shoes, our carriages, our equipages
would be very ill made. You will permit
one to say that the bleaching & dying of
wool & silk, cotton & flax, are chemical
processes, & that the conversion of them into
different clothes, is a mechanical invention
that the working of iron copper, tin &
lead, & the other metals; & the combining
them with the different alloys, by which
almost all the instruments necessary for
the turner, the joiner, the stone mason, the
ship builder & [insertion]are made[/insertion] are chemical inventions
Even the press, to the influence of which
I am disposed to attribute as much as you
can do, could not have existed in any
state of perfection without a metallic
alloy. The combining of alkali & sand

[page]28||dnp14b024pp|92018295[/page]
of certain clays & fluids together to form
glass & porcelain is a chemical process
The Colours which the artist employs
to frame resemblances of natural objects
or to create combinations more beautiful
than ever existed in nature are derived
from Chemistry. In short [deletion]always [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
in every branch of the common & fine
arts,- in every department of human
industry, the influence of this science is
felt. And we may find in the fable
of Prometheus taking the flame from
heaven to animate his man of clay
an emblem of the effects of fire in
its applications to chemical purposes
in creating the activity & almost the
life of civil society.
[deletion][unclear]Policixxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Philalethes[/insertion] It appears to me that

[page]29||dnp14b025pp|92018296[/page]
25
you attribute to science what in
many cases has been the result of
accident. The processes of most of
the useful arts which you call
chemical have been invented & improved
without any refined means, - without
[deletion]any[/deletion] general system of knowledge
Lucretius attributes to accident the
discovery of the fusion of the metals. A
person in touching a shell fish observes
that it emits a purple liquid, & applies
this purple liquid as a dye. Hence
the Tyrian purple. Clay is observed to
harden in the fire; & hence the invention
of bricks, which could hardly fail
ultimately to lead to the discovery of
porcelain. Even glass, the most perfect
& most beautiful of those manufactures

[page]30||dnp14b026pp|92018298[/page]
you call chemical is said to have been
discovered by accident. Theophrastus
states that some merchants who were
cooking on some lumps of soda or
natron near the mouth of the river
Belus, observed that a hard nitreous
substnace was formed when the fused
natron ran into the sand
[deletion]Philo[/deletion] [insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] I will readily allow that accident
has had much to do with the origin of
the arts, as with the progress of the sciences
but it has been by scientific processes &
experiments that these accidental results
have been rendered really applicable to
the purposes of common life. - Besides
it requires a certain degree of knowledge
of scientific combination to understand

[page]31||dnp14b027pp|92018299[/page]
27
& sieze upon the facts which have
originated in accident. It is certain
that in all fires alkaline substances
& sand are fused together, & clay hardened
yet for ages after the discovery of fire
glass & porcelain were unknown till
some men of genius profited by scientific
combinations often observed but never
applied. It suits the indolence of
those minds which never attempt any
thing & which probably if they did
attempt any thing, would not succeed
to refer to accident that which belong
to genius. It is sometimes said by
such persons that the discovery of the law
of gravitation, was owing to accident,
& a ridiculous story is told of the falling
of an apple as the cause of this
discovery.

[page]32||dnp14b028pp|92018300[/page]
as well might the invention of fluxion
or the architectural combinations of a
[deletion]bridge[/deletion] [insertion]the Dome of St Peter[/insertion] or the St John of Raphael, or
of the Apollo Belvedere be supposed to
be owing to accidental combinations.
In the progress of an art from its
crudest to its more perfect state, the
whole process depends upon experiments
Science is in fact nothing more than
the refinement of common sense, making
use of facts already known to acquire
new facts. Clays which are yellow are
known to turn red; calcareous earth
renders flint fusible. The persons who
have improved [deletion]the pottery[/deletion] [insertion]earthen ware[/insertion] made their
selections accordingly. Iron was discovered
at least 1000 grams before it was rendered
malleable; & from what Herodotus says

[page]33||dnp14b029pp|92018301[/page]
29
of this discovery, there can be little
doubt that it was developed by a
scientific worker in metals. Vitruvius
tells us that the cerulean, a colour made
of copper, which exists in perfection in
all the oil paintings of the Greeks & Romans
for the mummies of the Egyptians, was
discovered by an Egyptian King. There
is therefore every reason to believe that
it was not the result of accidental
combination, but of experiments made
for improving or producing colours
Amongst the ancient philosophers many
discoveries are attributed to Democritus
& Anaxagoras; & connected with the
chemical arts, the narration of the
inventions of Archimedes alone, by Plutarch
would serve to show how great is the

[page]34||dnp14b030pp|92018302[/page]
effect of science in [deletion]producing mechanical[/deletion] [insertion]creating power[/insertion]
[deletion]inventions. The arch in architecture[/deletion]
[deletion]is clearly owing to the geometricians.[/deletion] In
modern times, the refining of sugar, the
preparation of nitre, the manufacturing
of acids, salts & are all results of
pure [deletion]science[/deletion] [insertion]Chemistry[/insertion]. Take gunpowder as a
[underline]specimen[/underline] [deletion]of a chemical invention.[/deletion] No
person but a man infinitely diversifying
his [deletion]experiments[/deletion] [insertion]processes[/insertion] & guided by analogy could
have made such a discovery. Look into
the books of the Alchemists, & some
idea may be formed of the effects of
experiment. It is true these persons were
guided by false views; yet they made
most useful researcher, & Lord Bacon has
justly compared them to the husbandman
who searching for an imaginary treasure

[page]35||dnp14b031pp|92018303[/page]
31
fertilized the soil. They might likewise
be compared to persons who looking for gold
discover the fragments of beautiful statues,
which separately are of no value & which
appear of little value to the persons who
find them; but which when selected &
put together by artists, & their defective facts
supplied are found to be wonderfully
perfect & worthy of conservation. Look
to the progress of the arts since they have
been enlightened by a [underline]system of science[/underline],
& observe with what rapidity they have
advanced. Again, the Steam Engine
in its crudest form was the result of a
chemical experiment; in its refined
state, it required the combinations of all
the most recondite principles of Chemistry
& mechanics; & that excellent philosopher

[page]36||dnp14b032pp|92018304[/page]
who has given this wonderful instrument
of power to civil society, was led to the
great improvements he made by the discovery
of a kindred genius, on the heat absorbed
when water becomes steam, & of the heat
evolved when steam becomes water.
Even the most superficial observer must
allow in this case a triumph of science,
for what a wonderful impulse has this
invention given to the progress of the arts
& manufactures in our country; how
much has it diminished labour, how
much has it increased the real strength
of the country! Acting it were with
a thousand hands, it has multiplied
our active population, & receiving its
elements of activity from the bowels of
the earth, it performs operations which

[page]37||dnp14b033pp|92018305[/page]
33
formerly were painful, oppressive & unhealthy
to the labourers, with regularity & constancy
& gives security & precision to the efforts of
the manufacturers. And the inventions
connected with the steam engine, at the
same time that they have greatly diminished
labour of body; have tended to increase
power of mind & intellectual resources.
Adam Smith well observes that
manufacturers are always more ingenious
than Husbandmen; & manufacturers that
use machinery, will probably always be
found [deletion]always[/deletion] more ingenious than
[unclear]handicraft[/unclear] manufacturers.
You have spoken of porcelain as a result of
accident. The improvements made in the
Country, as well as those made in Germany
& France have been [unclear]entirely[/unclear] the result

[page]38||dnp14b034pp|92018306[/page]
of [underline]chemical experiments[/underline]. The Dresden &
the Sevres manufacturers have [insertion]been[/insertion] the work
of men of science; & it was by multiplying
[insertion]this chemical[/insertion] Researches that Wedgewood was enabled to
produce at so cheap a rate those beautiful
limitations of the work of the ancients,
which while they suppass them in solidity
& perfection of material, equal them in
the elegance, variety & tasteful arrangement
of their forms.
In another department, the use of the
electrical conductor was a pure scientific
combination; & the sublimity of the discovery
of the American Philosopher was only
equalled by the happy application he
immediately made of it. In our own
times it would be easy to point out
numerous instances in which great

[page]39||dnp14b035pp|92018307[/page]
35
improvements & beneficial results connected
with the comforts, the happiness, & even the
life of our own creatures, have been
the results of the scientific combination; but
I cannot do this without constituting myself
a judge of the works of philosophers who
are still alive, whose works are known
whose labours are respected & who will
receive from posterity praises that their
contemporaries hardly dare to bestow upon
them
[deletion][unclear]Philioritor[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] will allow that you have
shown in many cases the utility of
scientific investigations, as connected with
the progress of the useful arts; but in
gneral both the principles of chemistry
are followed, & views of experiments performed
without any view to utility; & a great

[page]40||dnp14b036pp|92018308[/page]
noise is made if a new metal or a new
substance is discovered, or if some
abstracted law is made known relating
to the phenomena of nature; yet amongst
the variety of new substances, few have
been applied to any [underline]trifling[/underline] use even, &
the greater number have had no application
at all, & with respect to the general
views of the science, it would be different
to show that any real good had resulted
from the discovery or extension of them
It does not add much to the dignity
of a pursuit, that those persons who have
followed it for profit have really been
most useful, & that the mere citizen or
Chemical manufacture has done more
for society than the chemical philosopher
Besides it has always appeared to me
chemical manufacturer has done more

[page]41||dnp14b037pp|92018309[/page]

that it in the nature of this science to
encourage mediocrity & to attach importance
to insignificant things: very slight chemical
labours seem to give persons a claim to the
title of philosopher. To have dissolved a few
grains of chalk in an acid; to have
shown that a very useless stone contains
certain known ingredients, or that the
colouring matter of a flower in soluble in
acid & not in alkali is thought by
some a foundation for chemical celebrity
I once began to attend a course of chemical
lectures, & to read the journals containing
the ephemeral productions of this science
I was dissatisfied with the nature of the
evidence which the Professor adopted in
his demonstrations, & disgusted with
the series of observations & experiments

[page]42||dnp14b038pp|92018310[/page]
which were brought forward one
month to be overturned the next. In
November there was a Zingerberic acid
which in January was shown to have
no existence. One year there was a
vegetable acid, which the next was shewn
to be the same as an acid known 30
years ago. Today a man was celebrated
for having discovered a new metal or a
new alkali, & they flourished like [deletion]the[/deletion]
scenes in a new pantomime only to disappear
Then the great [insertion]object[/insertion] of the hundred trifflers
in the science appeared to be to destroy
the [insertion]reputation of the[/insertion] three or four great men whose labours
were really useful & had in them something
of dignity; & there not being enough of
trifling results or false experiments to fire
up the pages of the [deletion]weekly[/deletion] [insertion]monthly[/insertion] journals, the

[page]43||dnp14b039pp|92018311[/page]
39
deficiency was supplied by some crude
theories or speculations of unknown persons
or by some ill-judged censure or partial
praise of the editor, who has sometimes
in his capacity been compared to a bee;
but who in these collections, generally has
appeared to me to have no other characteristic
of that useful insect, that his sting,
his poison bag, & his monotonous hum
[deletion]Phile[/deletion][insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] I deny in toto the accuracy
of what you are advancing. I have already
shown that real philosophers not labouring
for profit have done much by their own
inventions for the useful acts: & amongst
the new substances discovered, many have
had immediate & very important application
The Chlorine, or oxyminiatic gas of Scheele

[page]44||dnp14b040pp|92018312[/page]
was scarcely known before it was applied
by Berthollet to bleaching. Scarcely was
muriatic acid gas discovered by Priestly.
[deletion]before[/deletion][insertion]when[/insertion][underline][unclear]Guyton de Morveau[/unclear][/underline] used it for
destroying contagion. Consider the varied
& diversified application of platinum,
which has owed its existence as a useful
metal entirely to the labours [insertion]an illustrious[/insertion] chemical
philosopher. Look at the beautiful yellow
afforded by one of the new metals -[underline]Chrome[/underline]
Consider the medical effect of [underline]Iodine[/underline], in
some of the most harmful [insertion]& disgusting[/insertion] [unclear]maladies[/unclear] belonging
to human nature; remember how short
a time investigations have been made
for applying the new substances. Besides
the mechanical or chemical manufacturer
has merely discarded any thing; he
has merely applied what the philosopher
Cancer & Bronchocale

[page]45||dnp14b041pp|92018313[/page]
41
has made known; He has merely worked
upon the material furnished to him. We
have no history of the nuance in which
Iron was rendered malleable; but we know
that Platinum could only have been worked
by a person of the most refined chemical
resources, who made multiplied experiments
upon it after the most ingenious & profound
views. But waving all common utility-
all vulgar applications, there is something
in knowing & understanding the applications
of nature,- some pleasure in contemplating
the order & harmony of the arrangements
belonging to the terrestrial system of things
there is no absolute utility in poetry; but
it gives pleasure, refines & exalts the mind.
Philosophic pursuits have likewise a noble
& independent use of this kind, & there

[page]46||dnp14b042pp|92018314[/page]
is a double reason offered for pursuing them
for whilst in their sublime speculation they
reach to the heavens, in their application
they belong to the earth; whilst they
[insertion]exalt the intellect they[/insertion] provide food for our own common wants &
likewise minister to the noblest appetites
& most exalted views belonging to our
nature. The results of this science are
not like the temples of the ancients in which
statues of the Gods were placed, where incense
was offered & sacrifices were performed, &
which were presented to the adoration of
the multitude, founded upon superstitious
feelings; but they are rather like the palaces
of the moderns, to be admired & used; &
where the statues which in the ancients
raised feelings of adoration and awe, now produce
only feelings of pleasure & gratify a
refined taste. -

[page]47||dnp14b043pp|92018315[/page]
43
It is surely a pure delight to know how
& by what processes this earth is clothed
with verdure and life: how the clouds,
mists & rain are formed: what causes
all the changes of this terrestrial system
of things; & by what Divine laws, order
is preserved amidst apparent confusion
It is a sublime occupation to investigate
the cause of the tempest & the volcano &
to point out their use in the economy of
things. To bring the lightning from the
clouds & make it subservient to our
experiments; to produce as it were a
microcosm in the laboratory of art; &
to measure and weigh those invisible atoms
which by their motions & changes according
to laws impressed upon them by Divine
intelligence, constitute the universe of things.

[page]48||dnp14b044pp|92018316[/page]
The true chemical philosopher sees good
in all the diversified forms & appearances
of the external world. Whilst he
investigate the operations of infinite power
guided by infinite wisdom, all low
prejudices, all mean superstitions disappear
from his mind. He sees man an atom
amidst atoms fixed upon a point in
space & yet modifying the laws that act
around him by understanding them &
gaining as it were a kind of dominion
over time & an empire in material space
& exerting on a scale infinitely small, a
power, seeming a sort of shadow or
reflection of a creative energy, & which
entitles him to the distinction of being
made in the image of God laminated
by a spark of the Divine Mind.

[page]49||dnp14b045pp|92018317[/page]
45
Whilst chemical pursuits, exalt the
understanding, they do not depress the
imagination or weaken genuine feeling.
Whilst they give the mind habits of
accuracy by obliging it to attend to
facts, they likewise extend its analogies
& though conversant with the minutest
forms of things, they have for their
ultimate end the great & magnificent
objects of nature. They regard the formation
of a chrystal, the structure of a pebble,
the nature of a clay or earth, & they apply
to the causes of the diversity of our
mountain chains, the appearances of the
winds, thunderstorms, meteors, the earthquake
the volcano, & all those phenomena which
offer the most striking images to the
fact & the painter. They keep alive

[page]50||dnp14b046pp|92018318[/page]
that unextinguishable thirst after knowledge
which is one of the grandest characteristics
of our nature: for every new discovery
opens a new field for investigation: every
new acquisition of facts & news as the
imperfection of our theories. It has justly
been said, that the greater the circle of
light, the greater the boundary of darkness
by which it is surrounded. This strictly
applies to chemical enquiries, & hence they
are wonderfully suited to the progressive
nature of the human intellect - which by
its unceasing efforts to acquire a higher
kind of wisdom & a state in which
truth is fully & brightly revealed, seems
as it were to demonstrate its birthright
to immortality.
[deletion]Policixxx[/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] I am glad that my opposition

[page]51||dnp14b047pp|92018319[/page]

has led you to so complete a vindication
of your favourite science: I want no
further proofs of its utility; I regret

As our friend has so fully convinced us
[deletion]convinced me of its importance. I hope[/deletion]
of the importance of Chemistry. I hope
he will descend to some particulars as
to its real nature, its objects, its
instruments. I would willingly have a
definition of Chemistry & some idea of
the qualifications necessary to become
a chemist; & of the apparatus essential
for understanding what has been already
done in the science & for pursuing new

[page]52||dnp14b048pp|92018320[/page]
enquiries
[deletion]Philo[/deletion] [insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] There is nothing more difficult
than a good definition; for it is scarcely
possible to express in a few words the
abstracted view of an infinite variety
of facts. D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black has defined
Chemistry to be that science which treats
of the effects of heat & mixture; but
this definition is in my opinion much
too limited. Another author has defined
Chemistry to be that science which treats
of the changes produced in bodies by motions
of their ultimate particles or atoms; but
this definition is hypothetical, for the
ultimate particles or atoms are mere
creations of the imagination. I will give
you a definition which will have the
merit of novelty, & which is probably

[page]53||dnp14b049pp|92018321[/page]
49
[unclear]general[/unclear]in its application. [underline]Chemistry[/underline]
[underline]relates to those operations by which the[/underline]
[underline]intimate nature of bodies is changed, or[/underline]
[underline]by which they acquire new properties.[/underline]
This definition will not only apply to
the effects of mixture, but to the phenomenon
of electricity &in short to all the changes
which do not merely depend upon the
motion or division of masses of matter.
[deletion]you will have many opportunities of[/deletion]

 will not name as many as Athaeneus
for a Cook; who he says ought to be a

[page]54||dnp14b050pp|92018322[/page]
mathemetician, a theoretical musician
a natural philosopher, a natural historian
& though you had a disposition just
now to make Chemistry merely subservient
to the uses of the [underline]kitchen[/underline]; but I will
seriously mention some of the studies
fundamental to the higher departments
of this science. A man may be a
good practical chemist perhaps without
posessing them; but he never can
become a great chemical philosopher.
The person who wishes to understand
the higher departments of chemistry or
to pursue them in their most interesting
relations to the economy of nature, ought
to be well grounded in elementary
mathematics. He will [deletion]have[/deletion] oftener
have to refer to arithmetic than algebra

[page]55||dnp14b051pp|92018323[/page]
51
& to Algebra than to Geometry, but
all these sciences lend their aid to
Chemistry. Arithmetic in determining
the proportions of analytical results
& the relative weights of the elements
of bodies. Algebra in ascertaining
the laws of the pressure of elastic fluids
the force of vapours as dependent upon
temperature; & the effects of masses
& surfaces on the communication &
radiation of [underline]heat[/underline]. The applications of
Geometry are principally limited to the
determination of the chrystalline forms
of bodies, which form the most important
type of their nature, & often offer important
hints for analytical researches respecting
their composition. The first principles
of natural philosophy & general physics

[page]56||dnp14b052pp|92018324[/page]
ought not to be entirely unknown to
the Chemist. As the most active agents
are fluids, elastic fluids, heat, light,
& electricity; he ought to have a general
knowledge of mechanics, hydrodynamics
pneumatics, optics & electricity. Latin
[insertion]& Greek[/insertion] amongst the dead, & French amongst
the modern languages are necessary &
as the most important after French -
German. [insertion]& Italian[/insertion] In natural history & in
literature, what belongs to a liberal
education, such as that of our universities
is all that is required. Indeed a young
man who has performed the ordinary
course of college studies, which are
supposed fitted for common life &
for refined society has all the preliminary
knowledge accessory to commence the study

[page]57||dnp14b053pp|92018325[/page]
53
of Chemistry. The apparatus [insertion]essential[/insertion] [deletion]necessary[/deletion]
[insertion]to[/insertion] [deletion]for[/deletion] the modern [deletion]chemist[/deletion] [insertion]Chemical Philosopher[/insertion] is much less bulky
& expensive than that used by the ancients
An air pump, an electrical machine
a voltaic battery, (all of which may
be upon a small scale) a blowpipe
apparatus, a beloows & forge, a mercurial
& water gas apparatus, cups & basins of
platina & glass & the common reagents
of chemistry are what are required.
All the implements absolutely necessary
may be carried in a small trunk:
& some of the best & most refined
researches of modern chemists have been
made by means of apparatus which
might with ease be contained in a
small travelling carriage, & the expense
of which is only a few pounds.

[page]58||dnp14b054pp|92018326[/page]
The facility with which chemical enquiries
are carried on, & the simplicity of the
apparatus, offer additional reasons to
those I have already given for the
pursuit of this science. It is not
injurious to the health. The modern
Chemist is not like the ancient one who
passed the greater part of his time exposed
to the heat & smoke of a furnace & the
unwholesome vapours of acids, alkalies
& other menstrua, of which for a single
experiment be consumed several pounds.
His processes may be carried on in the
drawing room, & some of them are no
less beautiful[deletion]than[/deletion] in appearance than
satisfactory in their results. It was
said by an Author of the last century
of alchemy, that its beginning was

[page]59||dnp14b055pp|92018327[/page]
55
deceit, its progress labour, & its end
beggary. It may be said of modern
chemistry that its beginning is pleasure
its progress knowledge, & its objects truth
& utility.
I have spoken of the scientific attainments
necessary for the chemical philosopher
I will say a few words of the intellectual
qualities necessary for discovery, or for the
advancement of the science, Amongst
them, patience, industry & neatness in
manipulation, & accuracy & minuteness
in observing and registering the phenomena
they present, are essential. A steady
hand & a quick eye are most useful
auxiliaries, but there have been very
few great chemists who have preserved
these advantages through life; for the

[page]60||dnp14b056pp|92018328[/page]
business of the laboratory is a service
of danger & the elements like the refractory
spirits of romance, though the obedient
slaves of the magician yet sometimes
escape the influence of his talisman &
endanger his person & life. Both the
hands & the eyes of others however may
be [deletion]often [/deletion][insertion]sometimes [/insertion]advantageously made use of
By often repeating a process or an
observation, the errors connected with
hasty operations or imperfect views are
annihilated, & provided the assistant
has no preconceived notions of his own
& is ignorant of the object of his employer
in making the experiment, his simple
& base detail of facts will often be the
best foundation for an opinion.
With respect to the higher qualities of

[page]61||dnp14b057pp|92018329[/page]
57
intellect necessary for understanding &
developing the general laws of the science
[deletion]as you know my opinion respecting[/deletion] the
[deletion]universality of those powers connected[/deletion]
[deletion]with genius - that is[/deletion] [insertion]I believe that the same[/insertion] [deletion]that the same[/deletion]
talents are necessary for making advances
in every department of human knowledge
I need not be very minute. The [deletion]investigation[/deletion] [insertion]imagination[/insertion]
must be active and brilliant in seeking
analogies, yet entirely under the influence
of the judgement in applying them.
The memory must be extensive & profound
rather however calling up general views of
things than minute trains of thought,
The mind must not be like an [underline]Encyclopaedia[/underline]
- a burthen of knowledge, but rather a critical
Dictionary, which abounds in generalities
& points out where more minute information

[page]62||dnp14b058pp|92018330[/page]
may be obtained, In detailing the
results of experiments & in giving them
to the world, the chemical philosopher
should adopt the simplest style & manner
He will avoid all ornament, as something
injurious to his subject & should bear
in mind that saying of the first King
of Great Britain respecting a sermon
which was excellent in doctrine, but
overcharged with poetical allusions &
figurative language, that the tropes &
metaphors of the speaker were like the
brilliant white flowers in a field often
- very pretty but which did very much
hurt the corn. -
In announcing even the greatest &. most
important discoveries, the true philosopher
will communicate his details with

[page]63||dnp14b059pp|92018331[/page]
59
modesty & reserve. He will rather be
a useful servant of the public, bringing
forth a light from under his cloak when
it is needed in darkness than a charlatan
exhibiting fine works, & having a
trumpeter to announce their magnificence.
I see you are smiling, & think what
I am saying in bad taste; yet
notwithstanding I will provoke your
smiles still further, by saying a word
or two on his other moral qualifications.
That he should be humbleminded
you will readily allow & a diligent
searcher after truth, & neither diverted
from this great object by the love of
transient glory or temporary popularity
looking rather to the opinion of ages
than to that of a day, & seeking

[page]64||dnp14b060pp|92018332[/page]
[deletion]rather[/deletion] to be remembered & named [insertion]rather[/insertion] in the
epochas of historians than in the
columns of newspaper writers [insertion]or Journalists[/insertion]. He
should [deletion]remember[/deletion] [insertion]resemble[/insertion] the modern geometrician
in the greatness of his views & the
profoundness of his researches & the
ancient alchemists in industry & piety
I do not mean that he should affix
written prayers & inscriptions of
recommendations of his processes to
Providence as was the custom of
[underline]Peter Wolfe[/underline] the last of the Alchemical
school, & who was alive in my early
days; but his mind should always
awake to devotional feeling; & in contemplating
the variety & the beauty of the external
world & in developing its scientific
wonders he will always refer to that

[page]65||dnp14b061pp|92018333[/page]
61
infinite wisdom through whose beneficence
He is permitted to enjoy knowledge,
& in becoming wiser he will become better
he will rise at once in the scale
of intellectual & moral existence & his
increased sagacity will be subservient
to a more exalted faith; & in proportion
as the veil becomes thinner through
which he sees the causes of things,
he will admire more the brightness of
the light by which they are made visible

Dialogue 3.
Scene Vesuvius, Bay of Naples
Subject. on the powers which act
upon matter & produce Chemical changes
P. It is difficult to say whether
there is more of sublimity or beauty
in the scene before us; Nature appears
at once smiling & frowning, - in activity &
repose. How tremendous is the Volcano!
How magnificent the great laboratory of
Nature in its unceasing fire. - its
subteraneous lightnings & thunder; its
volume of smoke; its showers of stones
& its rivers of lava! How contracted
is the darkness of the lava, the ruins
& the desolation around the crater, with

[page]68||dnp14b064pp|92018336[/page]
the scene below! - The rich field covered
with flax or maize or millet, & interested
by rows of trees which serve as the
standards of the vine [deletion]tree[/deletion]. The orange
& lemon glow in the sheltered glen;
the olive tree rises on the hills, Islands
purple in the beams of the setting Sun
are scattered over the sea in the west,
tinted with red which softens into the
brightest azure. The distant mountains
still retain a part of the snow of winter,
but it is now melting, & it absolutely
seems to melt under the setting Sun,
glowing as if on fire. And man seems
emulous of nature; for the city below
is full of activity: the nearest part
of the bay is covered with boats

[page]69||dnp14b065pp|92018337[/page]
65
multitudes crowd the Strand. We
may see at the same time, house
building, ship building, rope making,
iron manufactured, agricultural processes
& a number of the arts belonging to
civilised society going on. We see not
only the life & activity of men at percent
existing; but we may pass into the
very bosom of antiquity, & as it were
life with the dead. These small
square buildings scarcely visible are
of the Greek Colonists of the
country; & those rows of buildings which
seem as if newly erecting, constitute
a Roman town restored from its ashes
that for centuries remained as if it had
been swept from the face of the earth

[page]70||dnp14b066pp|92018338[/page]
When you study it in detail, you
will hardly avoid the Museum of
believing that it is a rising city. You
will almost be tempted to ask where
are the workmen, so perfect are the walls
of the houses, so bright & uninjured the
paintings upon them, so fresh the marble
of the columns of its Temples; Hardly
any thing is wanting to make this
scene a magnificent epitome of all that
is most worthy of admiration in nature
& art: had there been in addition to
the other objects a fine river & a waterfall
the epitome had been complete
Philo.[superscript]s[/superscript] The scene in its present state
gives examples of almost all the changes

[page]71||dnp14b067pp|92018339[/page]
67
which belong to nature & art. The mountain
of Somma affords an example of marine
deposits, & of lava that has risen through
them. Though no cataract is visible, yet
there is a small river in the valley
fed by the dissolving snows. The dews
are now beginning to fall in consequence
of the cooling of the surface from radiation
& vegetation seems as it were to become
fresher in the cool of the evening.
Pol. Whilst we are waiting for what
is said to be one of the most magnificent
spectacles on earth - the rising of the sun
on Vesuvius, we must ask Philochemicus
to give us as he promised his first
chemical instructions on the active powers
which produce chemical changes: with

[page]72||dnp14b068pp|92018340[/page]
such an infinite variety of chemical phenomena
before our eyes, we can hardly long want
illustrations
[underline]Philo[/underline][superscript]S[/superscript] I shall most willingly go
through a lecture of this kind; & the
nature of the subjects by which I have
an opportunity of demonstrating the
general principles, may perhaps render the
development of these principles less tedious
[underline]P.[/underline] We are attentive
[underline]Philo.[/underline][superscript]s[/superscript] Whether we look at the heavens
or the earth, we percieve the general
series of changes which proceed with
tranquillity, occasionally interrupted by
extraordinary phenomena which at first
view appear independent of the great

[page]73||dnp14b069pp|92018341[/page]
69
laws of the system of the universe. Now
the fixed stars always retain the same
features, & planets & satellites the same
movements; whilst comets & meteoric bodies
appear to belong to a different order of
nature. And on our globe, whilst the
regular minds keep the atmosphere [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]& the tides[/deletion] & the ocean [insertion]in[/insertion] motion, & whilst
by the exposure [insertion]exposure[/insertion] of the earth to the sun
it is supplied with heat & moisture
Tempests, earthquakes & volcanic eruptions
seen to interfere with the harmony
of things; yet in fact both in the
Celestial [deletion]or[/deletion] [insertion]or[/insertion] terrestrial the great order
is the same. The comet & the meteor,
as our investigations become more refined
appear to be governed by the same

[page]74||dnp14b070pp|92018342[/page]
laws of attraction as the planets &
obey a similar impulse or movement
originallly impressed upon them. In the
terrestrial system of things, analogous
laws of chemical change [deletion]which[/deletion] causes
the sea water to deposit its contents
in the regular forms of chrystals, [deletion]in[/deletion]
[deletion]evaporation, or [insertion]or[/insertion][/deletion] occasion[deletion]ing[/deletion] the deposition
of the dew in a clear sky,- produce[deletion]s[/deletion]
the fixation of the lava from the volcano,
& the formation of the hailstorm.
I begin with these observations, because
as some of our instances will be drawn
rather from extraordinary than common
phenomena, I wish to impress upon your
minds, that the principles deduced from
the one will apply to the other, No if

[page]75||dnp14b071pp|92018343[/page]
71
I select rather striking & novel, than
ordinary & familiar illustrations, it is
not for the sake of creating difficulties,
but rather to give facilities: for not only
will they admit of similar explanations
but the general principles from being
associated with brilliant appearances or
striking phenomena are more likely to be
strongly impressed on the memory.
The forms of matter known to us are
solids, fluids & elastic substances or gases
& we may add radiant or ethereal
substances - those which by their rapid
motion or agency in space produce these
phenomena of heat, light, & electricity
To the three first, [deletion]as they are capable[/deletion]
[deletion]of being compiled[/deletion] we can apply the

[page]76||dnp14b072pp|92018344[/page]
test of weight; the last we know
only by their effects. The most
important power belonging to matter, is
attraction. this in the systems of
the universe preserves the parts of the
fixed stars, the sun & the [deletion]fixed[/deletion] planets
in their relative positions, & it is the
prince cause or governing principle of
all our terrestrial changes. When it
acts in masses, as you well [insertion]aware[/insertion] know, it is
known by the name of [underline]gravitation[/underline];
when it preserves the [deletion]structure[/deletion] [insertion]composition[/insertion] of a solid
or [deletion]the composition[/deletion] of a fluid, it is
called [underline]chemical attraction.[/underline] It is the
same power whether it unites alkaline
earth together in glass, or causes the
solution of salt or sugar in water.

[page]77||dnp14b073pp|92018345[/page]
73
or occasions charcoal when burning to
disappear in an invisible state in the
air.
[underline]Pol.[/underline] Why have you adopted the name
[underline]attraction[/underline] rather than [underline]affinity[/underline], which I
have often heard applied to this power
[underline]Philo.[/underline] [underline]Affinity[/underline] is a word founded
upon a mistaken view of the phenomena
The ancient chemists supposed that there
was a certain analogy or resemblance between
the substances [insertion][deletion]which[/deletion][/insertion] that unite[deletion]d[/deletion] together
chemically, which is not necessarily the
case; - indeed this property of matter
is exerted with most energy between
bodies that are most unlike each other
in their properties; the word [underline]affinity[/underline]

[page]78||dnp14b074pp|92018346[/page]
therefore, decidedly improper; besides
chemical [underline]attraction[/underline] has the merit of
expressing the nature of the power, &
is therefore unexceptionable.
[underline]Pol.[/underline] I am sorry I interrupted you
by so insignificant a question respecting
the meaning of a word when you were
developing to us the more important
relations of things.
[underline]Philo.[/underline] The chain of discussion is easily
resumed. Whenever two or more substances
whatever be their nature after coming in
contact, or after being mixed together, lose
the properties which distinguished them, &
actually become a new body; or when
they blend with each other so intimately

[page]79||dnp14b075pp|92018347[/page]
75
that not the smallest particle of either
of the original bodies can be perceived
or recovered by the finest mechanical
division, the result is one of chemical
attraction. Thus the definition will apply
to all the instances to which I have
already referred, & to every kind of chemical
action which is expressed by the term
combination.
Chemists have been accustomed to
express certain ideas respecting chemical
combination in a formal manner under
the name of laws or axioms,- such as
that chemical union only takes place
between different kinds of matter; that
bodies do not act upon each other unless
at least one of them is fluid or aeriform

[page]80||dnp14b076pp|92018348[/page]
but the correctness of many of these
propositions as they are usually detailed
may be questioned; & they present rather
a vague than an accurate manner of
expressing the results of observations. Minute
division & an approach to contact must
always precede the exertion of chemical
attraction; & the two most important
circumstances respecting it are, that it
generally unites bodies in certain uniform
or definite proportions, & that it is exerted
by different bodies with different degrees
of force; so that one body is capable of
attracting another from a compound, & of
separating the original facts of the combination
Pol. Will you be so good as to illustrate
these circumstances?

Phil.[superscript]s[/superscript] Willingly. If iron &
sulphur are mixed together & heated to
redness, in whatever quantities they
are mixed together, the compound will
always contain the same proportions
of iron & sulphur. If the sulphur
in the original mixture exceeds the
of iron, it will be drawn off
by the heat; if the iron exceed the
of sulphur, some of it will
be found in the centre of the mass in
its unaltered state.
Take another instance. If sulphuric
acid be poured upon lime & the result
be strongly heated, it will always be
found that the relation in which they
unite will be parts of lime to

[page]82||dnp14b078pp|92018350[/page]
parts of acid; & by no [insertion]known[/insertion] process can
any [deletion]substance[/deletion] [insertion]compound[/insertion] be formed from these
bodies containing any other [insertion]proportions,[/insertion] properties,
Again; You saw this evening round
the edge of the Crater of Vesuvius a
white incrustation which is principally
Sal Ammoniac. This salt may be
made from its elements by mixing together
1 volume of muriatic acid gas, & 1 volume
of [insertion]ammonia[/insertion] or volatile alkaline gas: if
either of the gasses be added in greater
proportion, the excess above the volume
remains unaltered. The whole extent of
chemical experience offers similar examples
& though I announced the proposition by
saying that bodies [underline]generally[/underline] combine in
definite proportions, yet it may be

[page]83||dnp14b079pp|92018351[/page]
79
questioned whether it might not be said
universally, & whether the exceptions are
not merely apparent, - depending upon
the [insertion]mixture of[/insertion] different definite combinations with
each other.
[underline]Pol.[/underline] You stated that sulphur & iron can
be only made to combine in the proportion
of parts to parts; yet surely I have
heard of a sulphuret of iron or pyrites, in
which there was a different proportion:
& all the elementary works contain descriptions
of various oxides, sulphurets & of the
same metal.
[underline]Philo.[/underline][superscript]s[/superscript] I was about to enter upon
this part of the subject when you spoke.
Sulphur & iron can only be made to combine
in one proportion in the method to which
I alluded

[page]84||dnp14b080pp|92018352[/page]
but there is found in nature, & there
may be formed by other methods, another
sulphuret,- The one to which you refer; &
in this likewise the proportions of the
elements are definite, & it contains exactly
twice as much sulphur as the other; &
there are numerous instances of bodies
combining in more than one proportion
two, three, but rarely four, & still more
rarely five or six, which seems to be
almost the limit. But in these varied
combinations there is always a relation of
the many properties; [insertion]proportions[/insertion] they are always
some multiples of or division of the first
proportion, - twice, or three times, or half or
one third & Thus the red oxide
of iron contains more oxygen than the
black oxide in the proportions of 3 to 2

[page]85||dnp14b081pp|92018353[/page]
81
The yellow oxide of lead contains exactly
half as much more oxygen than the white
oxide; the oxygen in one being
that in the other. In consequence
of these facts, the proportions in which
each decompounded body combines may
be expressed by a number; & by these
numbers all possible combinations may
be represented. Thus parts of oxygen
combine with one of sulphur, & one of
sulphur with of iron; & of iron
as you have heard with of
oxygene, & so on in all other cases;
& a beautiful simplicity is given to
Chemistry, which no longer appears a
vague collection of indefinite facts, but
as an exact science to which weight &
number may be applied, & of which the

[page]86||dnp14b082pp|92018354[/page]
results may be submitted to calculation
The fact of the combination of bodies
in definite proportions has led to the revival
of that ancient doctrine of the Greek
School attributed to Democritus, that
the real elements of bodies are certain
indestructible particles or atoms, from the
arrangements of which in various forms
& combinations all the varieties of matter
result. This doctrine which in its
application to Chemistry has been called
the [underline]atomic doctrine[/underline], or theory, has been
embraced by several modern Chemists;
but the development of it is owing to
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton, who seems to have been the
first person to generalize the facts of
Chemistry relating to definite proportions
& to draw this inference from them.

[page]87||dnp14b083pp|92018355[/page]
83
[underline]Pol.[/underline] If I am not mistaken, [underline]Newton[/underline]
in his optics, has given a view of this kind
& most of the great mechanical philosophers
seem to [insertion]have[/insertion] entertained some similar notions
[underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript][/underline]You are in the right; but until
lately, the idea was more a metaphysical
generalization than a probable influence
from facts; & all the arguments supporting
it are derived from the modern discoveries
in Chemistry. I shall often have occasion
to refer to this part of the subject, & I
will proceed in offering you examples
of the second important circumstances, namely
that [deletion]bodies[/deletion] [insertion]bodies[/insertion] combine with different degrees
of force; & in consequence that the [insertion]separation[/insertion] separation
of certain elements may be effected by
the attraction of other elements. If
[unclear]xx[/unclear] magnesia be dissolved in an acid

[page]88||dnp14b084pp|92018356[/page]
& lime whether solid or in solution in
water be added to the compound, the
lime will take [insertion]the[/insertion] place of the magnesia
& the magnesia will be [deletion]xx[/deletion]precipitated.
If to Sal ammoniac a little potash
be added, or vegetable alkali, & they
are rubbed together, the ammonia or
volatile alkali will fly off in the
elastic state the + the potash will unite
with the acid: Instances of this kind
may be multiplied to any extent; but
the simplest & the best belong to the
metallic substances. The common experiment
of lead thrown down in a chrystalized
form from its solution in vinegar is of
this kind. There likewise in the Mona
mine in the island of Anglesea, almost

[page]89||dnp14b085pp|92018357[/page]
85
all the Copper there obtained is by
precipitation from its native solution
in Sulphuric acid by iron [insertion]and[/insertion] knowing
the relative number representing the
chemical elements, it is easy to determine
exactly how much of one body will be
required to separate a given proportion
of another body. Thus of lime
will always separate of
Magnesia, whatever may be the nature of
the acid in which it is dissolved; &
of potassa will always cause
the evolution of of ammonia, &
of Zinc will always separate
of lead. The same difference
of chemical attraction which produces [insertion]the[/insertion]
decomposition of a compound by a single
decomposition of a compound by a single
of chemical attraction which produces [insertion]the[/insertion]

[page]90||dnp14b086pp|92018358[/page]
substance, likewise produces new
arrangements, of the parts of two
compounds when they are mixed together
& occasions the phenomenon known by
the name of complex attraction, or
double affinity. Then when two solutions,
[insertion]one[/insertion] of the compound of Sulphuric acid &
Magnesia, [insertion]is[/insertion] one of Nitric acid & lime,
are mixed together, the result will be
a compound of Sulphuric acid & lime
which for the most part, will be
thrown down in a solid form, &
a compound of nitric acid & lime that
for the most part will remain in solution
and by dividing, or as they have been
called, [unclear]divellant[/unclear] attractions of this kind,

[page]91||dnp14b087pp|92018359[/page]
87
substances that cannot be separated
from each other by any powers of
simpe attraction, may be made to
form new combinations: Thus sulphuric
acid & the alkali called Baryta
form a compound united with a
force which no known substance
is capable of overcoming at common
temperatures: yet by heating this
compound in powder with a solution
of vegetable alkali combined with
carbonic acid, the sulphuric acid
unites with the vegetable alkali, &
the baryta with the carbonic acid.
Of course in all instances of complex
as [deletion]in[/deletion] of simple attraction, the result

[page]92||dnp14b088pp|92018360[/page]
may be known by calculation; for
the different substances must always
separate & unite in [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] relative proportion
in which they exist in the compound
These in carbonate of potassa & sulph
of baryte consist respectively of alkali
& acid; & sulphate of potassa consists
of acid & alkali, & carbonate of barys
of acid & alkali. Indeed the demonstration
of this by Richter may be said to
have laid the foundation of definite
proportions, & however Dalton may be
considered as reviver of the atom
system, the author of the application of
the hypothesis to this doctrine, & the
illustrat[deletion]ion[/deletion][insertion]or[/insertion] of it by the example of the

[page]93||dnp14b089pp|92018361[/page]
89
multiples, where bodies combined in
more than 1 proportion, while a prior
claim belongs to Richter, who by
determining the law of the relations
of the proportions in all the compounds
of the same body, must be considered
as the founder of true definite
chemistry.
Pol. I am rather surprised that in
all you have said on the subject
of chemical attraction you have not
yet referred to an opinion of M.
Berthollet, which in the only course of
chemical lectures I ever attended was
considered as of primary importance, & whose
by supporting the dependence of chemical

[page]94||dnp14b090pp|92018362[/page]
attraction for the mass or quantity of
acting matter, seems to invalidate
if it be correct this newer doctrine
of definite proportions.
[underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript][/underline] Whatever is advanced by Berthollet
even when it is not correct is entitled
to discussion, & his name always commands
respect. It was always my intention to have
entered immediately on this subject
If by the effect of mass it be meant
that when one body is combined with
two or three, or more, proportions of
another, it is less readily acted upon
by a third body having a chemical
attraction for it rather than when it is
combined with one proportion, there [unclear]xx[/unclear]
be no doubt of the fact this [unclear]xxx[/unclear]

[page]95||dnp14b091pp|92018363[/page]
91
double combination of sulphur & iron
is not [deletion]attracted[/deletion] [insertion]acted on[/insertion] by diluted muriatic 
acid, though the iron is readily
separated from the sulphur by this
means in the single sulphruet: And
when one proportion of oxygen is
combined with one proportion of azote
as in nitrous gas, it is much more
readily attracted from it by combustible
bodies than when it is combined with
two proportions, as in nitrous oxide
a portion of lime from [unclear]Sulphosphate[/unclear] of
lime, or earth of bones, but is incapable
Separating the whole of the lime, so
as to leave the acid free; & there remains
a definite acid compound of lime & phosphoric
acid.

[page]96||dnp14b092pp|92018364[/page]
[unclear][underline]Phuseus[/underline][/unclear], If decomposition can be prevented
by agencies of this kind, may it not
be likewise produced?
[underline]Phil[superscript]s[superscript][/underline] I was about to state this;
but always according to the laws
definite proportions. Thus decomposition
may be affected to form binary or
ternary compounds, which could not
be effected to form single compounds,
& consequently quantity must be necessary
for the effect. In both these cases the
expression is correct; but if it be supposed
that by applying a large quantity of a
substance having a weak affinity for
another, the combination between another
& a third body may be destroyed to form
a combination in which no definite

[page]97||dnp14b093pp|92018365[/page]
93
proportions can be assigned, the idea
of M Berthollet is erroneous. He has
it is true adduced various experiments
which he considers as proving the
Circumstance, but all of them are capable
of other interpretations, & and in general his
explanations are partial accounts of
phenomena in which agents have been
concerned that he does not take into
the account. For instance, he finds that
sulphuric [insertion]acid[/insertion] exists in Solution of potassa
after it has been boiled in Carbonate
of Baryta; hence he concludes that a
large quantity of potassa is capable of
attracting Sulphuric acid from Baryta.
Whereas the true explanation of the phenomenom

[page]98||dnp14b094pp|92018366[/page]
may be, that the solution of potassa [deletion]must[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion]
capable of dissolving a small quantity
of Sulphate of Baryta: this view
Cannot be admitted even if he shews
that an [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] excess of Baryta remains
in the Sulphate; for then it may be
a phenomenon of double decomposition
in which water quits the hydrate of
potassa, to form with Sulphuric acid
& Baryta, a hydrate subsulphate of Baryta
& one portion of Sulphuric acid quits
the baryta to form a Subsulphate of
potassa. It cannot even be imagined
that chemical agents exert their attractive
powers at a distance, & when decomposition
take place in fluid menstrua, they usually
depend upon very complicated causes

[page]99||dnp14b095pp|92018367[/page]
95
The relations of the attractive powers of
the water itself must be always taken
into the account, & certain saline
bodies have their solubility in water
increased by the presence of other
Saline bodies, & the contrary. To prove
really that there are any phenomena in
chemical affinity, the same as that
which is the most important circumstance
of gravitation, it should be proved that
though a small plummet of lead has
no action on a Solution of Zinc, yet
that this plummet when forming a mass
weighing [insertion]many[/insertion] hundred weight; readily
produced its decomposition, which is
known not to be the case. I shall
weighing [insertion]many[/insertion] hundred weight, readily

[page]100||dnp14b096pp|92018368[/page]
Now after this discussion resume the
Subject of the circumstances under
which chemical attraction is exerted.
It might be supposed that when 1
[insertion]quantify it a[/insertion] body can unite with 2, 3, or 4 different
quantities of another, that its attraction
for it must be strong; yet this
does not appear to be necessarily the
case, & azote & oxygene & chlorine which
unite in more than one proportion, form
very loose combinations: whereas Zinc
& oxygene & potassium & chlorine which
combine only in one proportion unite
with a great degree of force. In general
the condensation of the bodies after [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
afford a pretty certain indication of the
forces that unite them: The metals

[page]101||dnp14b097pp|92018369[/page]
97
potassium & Sodium become actually
heavier by uniting with oxygene &
chlorine, & pure fluoric acid & water
form a substance much heavier than
its two constituents. Chemical action
however is very much influenced by the
[underline]forms[/underline] in which bodies exist, & when
gasses are con[deletion]s[/deletion][insertion]c[/insertion]erned, the same circumstances
do not apply as to fluids & solids: thus
oxygene becomes lighter by dissolving
one portion of charcoal when the attraction
may be supposed strongest, & heavier
by dissolving two portions when the attractive
powers must be diminished. In these
instances, it is probable that agents
which cannot be weighed are concerned
& which are only known by their effects
its two constituents. Chemical action

[page]102||dnp14b098pp|92018370[/page]
Phus. May not even the instance
which you just now quoted of the
Bisulphuret of iron not being acted
upon by diluted sulphuric acid, be
explained from a mechanical effect,
that the particles of the iron being [unclear]defend[/unclear]
by a larger quantity of sulphur are
not so much exposed to the contact
of the acid.
[unclear][underline]Phhi[/underline]l[/unclear]. Possibly the true solution of
all the phenomena of chemistry may
ultimately be mechanical, or be dependent
upon the primary attractive powers of
the corpuscles of matter influenced by
their forms & masses: but so simple
a mechanical [deletion]a[/deletion] solution of the problem
as that you have given will not

[page]103||dnp14b099pp|92018371[/page]
99
apply: a smaller expanse of surface
might diminish the velocity of action,
but would not destroy the action altogether
If iron filings be mixed with [underline]20[/underline] or [underline]30[/underline]
times is volume of [deletion]powdered[/deletion] sulphur
[insertion]in powder[/insertion]
the agency of an acid upon it will
be diminished, but not prevented:
the fact therefore must be considered
as a chemical & not a mechanical
phenomenon.
[underline]Phuseus.[/underline] You have destroyed my
vague notion; but in destroying
it you still seem to allow of the
possibility of a mechanical solution
of chemical appearances & consequently
the possibility of the effect of mass or
quantity [insertion]in influencing[/insertion] in influencing combination wherever
it can act.
the fact therefore must be considerd

[page]104||dnp14b100pp|92018372[/page]
[underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript],[/underline] You are right: I admit it
wherever it can act; but I do not
think this action depends upon the
quantities that are mechanically mixed
together. 1000 parts of one substance
having a weak affinity for another
will not separate another substance
having a strong affinity for it, It
must be supposed on the atomic hypotheses,
that for the exertions of those attractions
which produce chemical union the
[underline]particles[/underline] must be extremely near
& the proximity required may bear the
same proportion of the smallest
mechanical distance which we can
measure by the eye or even to appear
intact, that the distance of the fixed
stars

[page]105||dnp14b101pp|92018373[/page]
101
that our system bears to the distance
of the moon to the earth; & we know
that these immense [insertion]vast[/insertion] masses distributed
through the immensity of space have
no sensible effect on the motions of the
planets round the sun: And to
select an analogy still more striking
the motion of the moon round the
earth is comparatively little influenced
by the attraction of the sun
P. In developing the Atomic System
You have mentioned only the names of
Dalton & of Richter; Now I remember
some years ago hearing a gentleman
lay claim to this doctrine, M[superscript]r[/superscript] W[superscript]m[/superscript]
Higgins, Professor of Chemistry to the
by the attraction of the sun.

[page]106||dnp14b102pp|92018374[/page]
Dublin Society; & he referred to a
book published at least ten years
before M[superscript]r[/superscript] Daltons papers, & I believe
even before Richters papers, called
[underline]A Comparative view &c[/underline].
[underline]Philo![/underline] You are perfectly right; the
claim has been urged, & the book
Certainly contains views which support
it: but M[superscript]r[/superscript] W Higgins appears to have
had only some loose ideas of particles
Combining with particles, without any
profound views of the quantity being
unalterable; & there is a good reason
for thinking that these ideas as he
expresses them, were gained from another
source - Dr Bryan Higgins, who many
years before supported the notion that

[page]107||dnp14b103pp|92018375[/page]
103
the chemical substances were formed of
molecules, either Simple or Compound,
surrounded by an atmosphere of
heat; this views though not developed
with precision, approach nearer to those
of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dalton than those of his Cousin
But neither of these gentlemen attempted
any statistical expressions; & to Richter
& Dalton belong the exclusive merit
of having made the doctrine practicable
as a theoretical view, other Authors
have a claim to it, & the earlier
followers of Newton, such as Keel,
Hartly & Mazzuci all attempted
a corpuscular chemistry, founded upon
figure, weight, & attractive power of the
ultimate particles of matter; but

[page]108||dnp14b104pp|92018376[/page]
this Chemistry was of no real use
& had no other foundation than in the
imagination - Indeed in my opinion
M[superscript]r[/superscription] Dalton is too much of an [underline]Atomic[/underline]
[underline]Philosopher[/underline]; & in making atoms arrange
themselves according to his own
hypothesis, he has often indulged in
vain speculation; & the essential &
truly useful part of his doctrine,
the expression of the quantities in [unclear]ways[/unclear]
bodies combine, is perfectly independent
of any views respecting the ultimate
nature either of matter or its elements.
[underline]Pol[/underline] Pardon me for the observation;
but I expected some illustration of the
doctrine respecting attraction by the
grand phenomena by which we all

[page]109||dnp14b105pp|92018377[/page]
105
surrounded, & almost all your instances
have been drawn from analytical
processes.
Phil[superscript]s[/superscript] I have chosen these & given
them in the introduction of the subject
because they are more simple & are
within our power; but it was & is
my intention, to apply the principles &
facts I have developed to some of
the grand changes now surrounding
us; but you must not expect me
to launch out at this time upon the
hypothetical part of the subject - the
Causes of volcanic phenomena: this
discussion must be reserved for a more
advanced period of our scientific intercourse
the principal effects that we witness

[page]110||dnp14b106pp|92018378[/page]
are owing to elastic fluids which
press or throw out of the bowels of
the earth matter fused or altered
by subterraneous fire: & these produced
are no sooner deposited in our
atmosphere than they undergo various
changes which offer illustrations of the
the laws of attraction. The white
fumes that you see are owing
principally to Muriatic acid gas
which is combining with the invisible
moisture forming a part of the
elastic air, & which falls with it
in a fluid form. The white efflorescence
or incrustations which in so many places
cover the recently cooled lava are
saline substances which are separated
from the strong matter by the attack

[page]111||dnp14b107pp|92018379[/page]
107
of water & carbonic acid. And the
lavas themselves which present externally
a mere vitreous or amorphous structure,
internally examined when they have
cooled slowly, will be found to have
obeyed the laws of chrystalisation, &
their elements have separated in definite
compounds & in regular forms. Some
lavas have already crumbled into soils
from the attraction of substances in the
atmosphere for the iron, lime, alkali
& other matter found in them: And
living nature asserting her empire is
covering the more recent ones with lichens
& mosses; whilst certain of the more
ancient ones are the bases of the vineyard
or the cornfield. I might multiply these

[page]112||dnp14b108pp|92018380[/page]
applications of Science to a considerable
extent; but they are less instructive
though perhaps more entertaining than
the facts which we can command, &
which offer more accurate [unclear]demonstra[unclear]
of science.
Pol. [deletion]One mountain has brought [unclear]for[/unclear][/deletion]

was slightly affected

[underline]Philalethes.[/underline] [insertion]What you say is[/insertion]
[deletion]the antiquity of the globe. The[/deletion]
[insertion]perfectly true[/insertion] [deletion]animals contained in these caverns[/deletion]
[deletion]certainly offer a very curious subject[/deletion]
[deletion]of physiological [deletion]research[/deletion][/deletion], & I shall
gladly communicate such particulars
as I have learnt respecting[deletion] them[/deletion];
[insertion]the proteus anquinus[/insertion] & as we have the specimens under our
eyes, we can judge how far the history
given of their habits & reorganization is
correct. At first view the Proteus
might be supposed to be a lizard,
but it has the motions of a fish, &
its head, the lower part of its body
& its tail, bear a strong resemblance
to those of the eel; but it has no
fins & its bronchial organs are not

[page]133||dnp14b129pp|92018401[/page]
129
like the gills of fishes, but are external
[deletion]& as I have been informed by Mr [unclear]Schreiber[/unclear][/deletion]
they may be removed without occasioning
the death of the animal, who is
likewise furnished with lungs; with
this double apparatus for inspiration
it can live either in air or in
water. Its for feet resemble hands
but they have only three claws or
fingers, & are too feeble to be of use
in grasping & supporting the weight
of the animal. The hinder feet have
only two claws or toes; & in the largest
animals, are found so imperfect, as
to be almost obliterated. It has
small points in the place of eyes

[page]134||dnp14b130pp|92018402[/page]
as if to preserve the analogy of nature
It is of a fleshy whiteness & transparency
in its natural state, but becomes
darker by long exposure to light. It
has teeth; from which it may be
concluded that it is an animal of
prey; yet in [deletion]its[/deletion] a confined state it
has never been known to eat; & it
has been kept alive for years without
changing except in colour.
[deletion]Phil[/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] Has it been found only in this
one situation?
[underline]Philal.[/underline] For a long while the cave
of Adelsborough was the only place
in which it was found; but lately
it has likewise been discovered in a

[page]135||dnp14b131pp|92018403[/page]
131
similar situation at [unclear]Silich[/unclear], about
25 miles to the east; & probably
when minute researches are made, it
will be found in other places
amongst limestone mountains; [deletion]for[/deletion]
[deletion]it can hardly be supposd only to[/deletion]
[deletion]belong to two spots on the surface[/deletion] [insertion]Indeed I have likely heard it has[/insertion]
[deletion]of the globe. One of your questions[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]has[/unclear] recently found in Sicily. -[/insertion]
[deletion][unclear]Phuseus[/unclear], was whether it is born in[/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes. Do you think this grotto[/insertion]
[deletion]the place where it is found. To this[/deletion] [insertion]is its [unclear]return[/unclear] place.[/insertion]
[deletion]it appears to me the reply ought to[/deletion] [insertion]Phil. I think [unclear]not[/unclear][/insertion]
[deletion]be in the negative. - [/deletion] The probability
is that [deletion]its native place[/deletion] [insertion]it really belongs[/insertion] to a great
interior lake which communicates by
small passages with the grotto [deletion]that[/deletion]
[deletion]we have just seen.[/deletion] [insertion]in what we now are.[/insertion] They are seldom

[page]136||dnp14b132pp|92018404[/page]
found [deletion]in the grotto[/deletion] [insertion]here [deletion]water[/deletion] in dry [insertion]seasons[/insertion] [deletion]weather[/deletion]
but after great rains & when the quantity
of water is considerably increased,
they are numerous; & it is evident
that the mud which covers the bottom
of this grotto is brought in by the water
& at the same time these animals
seem removed from this natural
situation. There have been no large
ova ever found in them; from which
it is probable that the individuals
we see are not mature, & that the
adult animal is much larger; & as
the communication with the interior
must be by very narrow crevices or
apertures, it is probable that the larger
animals cannot pass them. Another

[page]137||dnp14b133pp|92018405[/page]
133
argument in favour of this opinion
is that the animal is extremely
sensible to the changes of weather
& in stormy & rainy weather always
remains at the bottom of the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
in which it is kept; & if there be
mud, endeavours to hide itself as if
in its natural situation [deletion][unclear]securing xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
it had the habit of doing so, [deletion]as if[/deletion] to avoid
of the danger of being carried into
[deletion]light, & into[/deletion] a place unfitted for
its existence [deletion]by floods[/deletion].
[deletion]Phil.[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]Eubathes[/unclear][/insertion] May it not be the lava
of some large & unknown animal?
Its feet do not seem intended for its
present organisation, & were they removed
it would have all the characters
of a fish

[page]138||dnp14b134pp|92018406[/page]
[underline]Philo.[/underline][insertion]s[/insertion] There is I believe, in nature
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear]no[/deletion] instance of a [unclear]larva[/unclear] having feet
& losing them in its new state of
existence: no instance of a transition
from a more perfect into a less
perfect animal. The tadpole has
a resemblance to a fish before it
becomes a frog. The caterpiller & the
maggot gain not only more perfect
powers of motion on the earth in
their new state; but acquire [underline]organs[/underline]
by which they inhabit a new element.
This animal may [deletion]increase in size[/deletion] [insertion]be larger than we[/insertion]
now see it
in its native places, but it is extremely
improbable that it changes in its [insertion]state[/insertion] [deletion]nature[/deletion]
& it adds one [underline]instance[/underline] more to the
number already known, of the wonderful

[deletion][underline]Phuseus[/underline]. When you finished your[/deletion]

[page]140||dnp14b136pp|92018408[/page]
instructions respecting vegetable
Chemistry, you promised to give us
a general view of what was known
respecting animal chemistry: there
cannot be a better opportunity than
the present, for the singular appearance
& the peculiarity of origin, habits
& functions of the animal we have
been just examining, requires some
elucidation, from Animal Chemistry
& its [unclear]name[/unclear] might serve as a title
for a dissertation on the Science of
animated nature. For the Proteus
of antiquity may be considered as an
allegory relating to the various chemical
changes of matter in assuming

[page]141||dnp14b137pp|92018409[/page]
137
organized forms, & to the impossibility
of submitting to experiment, or binding
in chains the divine principle which
is the cause of animation.
[underline]Philo[/underline][superscript]s[/superscript] I shall pursue the same
order as I adopted in considering
vegetable chemistry. I shall first
speak of the organization & composition
of animated beings, then of their
functions, & lastly of their decay &
reproduction. Throughout living
nature, from the polypus or the
earthworm, - from the least perfect
& most grovelling creature to man,
the miracle of terrestial creation,
there is a decided analogy or similarity

[page]142||dnp14b138pp|92018410[/page]
of parts, functions & elements; & in
consequence it is not difficult to
develope general views of the subject
of animal chemistry. In the exterior
organization there is a [underline]skin[/underline], or
something analogous, covered by a
cuticle & abundantly supplied with nerves
& which is the [insertion]seat[/insertion] of the general sensation
of touch & heat. Parts of this organ
are interrupted by distinct organs of
sensation: the eye furnished with nerves
capable of receiving specific impressions
connected with a knowledge of the
presence & distance of objects, or of
some important qualities of them.
These nerves which in their collected

[page]143||dnp14b139pp|92018411[/page]
139
state are like white strings or cords
communicate impressions to a common
sensorium, from which other news
pass connected with certain bundles
of fibres or muscles, placed beneath
the skin, & which are locomotive, &
which are themselves attacked by
membranes to certain hard & solid
organs, situated internally as bones,
or externally as shells or cases, &
which give strength & solidity &
powers of motion to the animal.
The heart or arteries or something
similar constitute another set of
contractile pores by which a fluid
is propelled to every part of the body

[page]144||dnp14b140pp|92018412[/page]
& returned to its original source after
having been partly extended in various
secretions & uses. These secretions are
performed by involutions of vascular
parts [insertion]furnished with nerves[/insertion] of which the most essential
are the liver, the kidneys, & the organs
of secretion connected with the reproduction
of the species. The organs of nutriment
consist of a stomach or stomachs
in which digestion is performed & a
long series of delicate membranes
through which the food passes, & in
which its nutritive parts are collected
by the extremities of [deletion]male[/deletion] [insertion]small[/insertion] vessels
called lacteals & carried into the blood
The organs of respiration consist either
of bronchi or lungs by which the blood

[page]145||dnp14b141pp|92018413[/page]
141
is exposed to the influence of are
either in its elastic state or dissolved
in water. From these solid & fluid
parts there may be obtained by different
processes of chemistry various animal
substances such as gelatine or glue
which combined with water constitutes
jelly, albumen or fluid substance
capable of being rendered solid by
heat; & which is the same as the white
of egg; fibrine, which is insoluble in
water, Urea lithic acid, & various other
substances, many of which may be
considered rather as the products of our
experiments, than as really existing in
the states in which they are procured in

[page]146||dnp14b142pp|92018414[/page]
the animal organs; & which, though
differing extremely in their appearances
& properties consist of very nearly the
same elementary matter.
As the great end of all the arrangement
of our terrestial system seems the
production & conservation of living beings
it might be expected that the elements
which compose the animal creation
would be numerous; & this is really
the case, but they are pretty nearly
the same as those of vegetables, & the
great difference is this: that animal
matter abounds in azote & contains
less carbon than vegetables; & that the
only earthy substances formed in animal
matter, are lime & magnesia: the

[page]147||dnp14b143pp|92018415[/page]
143
constituents consequently are azote,
oxygene, hydrogene, chlorine, phosphorus
sodium, sulphur, potassium, calcium
magnesia & iron, which are arranged
in such an infinite number of
combinations as to baffle the power
of analysis or description. The earthy
matter principally exists in the bones
tendons & ligaments; the muscular
fibre abounds in azote; the
composition of the nerves does not
appear very different from that
of the muscles; the skin is for
the greatest part gelatinous: the
blood contains all the elements found
in every other part of the system;
its fluid part is principally water, & red

[page]148||dnp14b144pp|92018416[/page]
parts float in it coloured by a
peculiar [insertion]combination of iron[/insertion] [deletion]matter[/deletion].
[underline]Phus.[/underline] WIll you not give us a
few more particulars upon the different
animal solids or fluids. I had
always supposed the blood coloured
by [insertion]subphosphate of[/insertion] iron, & that this colouring matter
had ever been imitated.
[underline]Philo[/underline][superscript]s[/superscript] To detail the properties &
the analyses of the different animal
substances, would in any opinion be
a very tedious & useless labour: & it
would be impossible to carry away
in the memory any accurate view of
a number of combinations distinguished
only by small difference; each organ
is composed of so many parts that

[page]149||dnp14b145pp|92018417[/page]
145
a mechanical or anatomical division
is very difficult; & to attempt to
define the quantities of gelatine,
fibrine, albumen, mucus & in a
piece of nerve or muscle would be of
no use; for the analysis of an organ
commonly resembles that of a whole
small animal. The most interesting
part of animal chemistry & the only
satisfactory part, must be detailed
like that of vegetable chemistry in its
connection with physiology & with the
functions & uses of the organs: & in this
department of Science there are very
beautiful & happy illustrations.
With regard to your observations on
the colouring matter of the blood

[page]150||dnp14b146pp|92018419[/page]
I have not to correct my statement
the latest researches have proved that
the observations which were supposed
to demonstrate that the colour was
owing [deletion]to iron[/deletion] (the sub phosphate) are
inexact; [deletion]& the[/deletion] [insertion]nature of the compound[/insertion] red particles are found
similar in their [insertion]in whole unknown[/insertion] composition to the soft
solid parts.
[underline]Pol[/underline]. I am very glad you have
taken this method of treating your
subject; for in this other way can
it be made interesting: & to have
given us the history of a great society
of analyses of animal substance & organs
without reference to their functions
& use would be almost as absurd &
useless as to attempt to teach a

[page]151||dnp14b147pp|92018420[/page]
147
language to the student who had
not yet acquired a word of it,
passages from its classical Authors
[underline]Philo.[superscript]s[/superscript][/underline] I cannot say that I think
your comparison quite correct; but
be this as it may I will not interruopt
the progress of our discussion If any
adventitious criticisms or comments.
One of the important functions &
which under different modifications
is exerted by every class of animated
beings is nutrition. There is no
insect, no zoophite, however imperfect
who has not some organ analagous
to a stomach, or which some process
analagous to digestion is not performed
The parts of vegetables or animals
macerated

[page]152||dnp14b148pp|92018421[/page]
by the teeth or ground by the
gizzard & mixed with some fluids
secreted in the organs which purpose
them for nourishment are dissolved by the
peculiar solvent in the stomach &
the fluid & finer parts are absorbed
by the lacteals & carried into the
thoracic duct, & the superabundant
solid part evacuated in faeces. The
gastric juice seems analogous in its
composition to some of the vegetable
poisons, which have a strong affinity
for the constituent parts of animal
matter: thus it dissolves fibrin or
albumen or glutine in the same manner
as oil dissolves soap; & when these
absorbed

[page]153||dnp14b149pp|92018422[/page]
149
parts of vegetable or animal matter
are brought into a state of fluidity
principally saccharine or parts which are
become readily soluble in the water
which is always taken into the
stomach. The substances taken
up from the flood by the lacteals
is extremely similar to milk, which
myself is the first nourishment of a
great tribe of animated beings: &
the yolk of the eggs is a substance
if the same kind for those beings
where incubation is performed, &
where the offspring is formed out
of the body. After the nutritious
matter is carried into circulation

151
[deletion]be regarded, if would appear as if
the only use of respiration were to
free the blood from a certain quantity
of carbonaceous matter; but it is
probable that this is only a secondary
object, & that the change produced
by respiration upon the blood is of
[deletion]a much more important kind[/deletion]
[deletion]heat we know is generated whenever[/deletion]
[deletion]charcoal is combined with oxygene[/deletion]
[deletion]& it has been supposed by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black[/deletion]
[deletion]that the animal heat is essential[/deletion]
to life was derived from the functions
[deletion]of respiration, as a sort of effect of[/deletion]
[deletion]slow combustion. D[superscript]r[/superscript] Crawford[/deletion]
[deletion]brought forward another doctrine; He[/deletion]
[deletion]imagined that the oxygene gas in[/deletion]

[page]156||dnp14b152pp|92018425[/page]
[deletion]combining with the blood, did[/deletion]
[deletion]not evolve its heat, but carried it[/deletion]
[deletion]into the arterial blood; & that there[/deletion]
[deletion]heat was evolved in the system[/deletion]
[deletion]owing to the conversion of arterial[/deletion]
[deletion]into venous blood. This opinion of[/deletion]
[deletion]Dr Crawford's has been experimentally[/deletion]
[deletion]controverted by Dr Davy, who has[/deletion]
[deletion]shewn that there is no sensible[/deletion]
[deletion]difference between the specific heat[/deletion]
[deletion]or capacity for heat, of venous blood[/deletion]
[deletion]& arterial blood: & he adopts the[/deletion]
[deletion]opinion that animal heat is the[/deletion]
[deletion]result of respiration, & that as the[/deletion]
[deletion]principle change is the disappearance [/deletion]
[deletion]of oxygen & the introduction of carbonic[/deletion]
[deletion]acid, & as heat is always evolved[/deletion]

[page]157||dnp14b153pp|92018426[/page]
153
[deletion]when carbonic acid is formed[/deletion]
[deletion]from charcoal & oxygen, that it[/deletion]
[deletion]is a fair inference that it is[/deletion]
[deletion]likewise produced in the lungs.[/deletion]
[deletion]It may however certainly be doubted[/deletion]
[deletion]if respiration be so simple a process[/deletion]
[deletion]as is imagined the venous blood gives[/deletion]
[deletion]off carbonic acid gas under the[/deletion]
[deletion]exhausted receiver of the airpump;[/deletion]
[deletion]& this carbonic acid may not be[/deletion]
[deletion]formed in the lungs, but in living[/deletion]
[deletion]action in the circulation & evolved[/deletion]
[deletion]at the same time that oxygene[/deletion]
[deletion]is absorbed. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Brodie has[/deletion]
[deletion]endeavoured to show that animal[/deletion]
[deletion]heat is a result of living action not[/deletion]

[page]158||dnp14b154pp|92018427[/page]
connected with respiration. & that
it depends upon the nerves; & he
states that an animal may be
kept alive when the thoracic nerves
are divided by producing respiration
artificially; & that in this case its
animal heat goes on gradually
diminishing: but it may be questioned
whether in this case the same quantity
of oxygene gas is absorbed, or whether
the same changes take place in the
arterial blood.
[underline]Pol.[/underline] I know you yourself have
made may experiments on the function
of respiration & you must have formed
an opinion of the nature of this
important process. Will you favour

155
us with your sentiments on the
subject
[deletion][underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript].[/underline] Most Willingly.[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] Oxygene
in its elastic state has properties
which are very characteristic: it gives
out [deletion]heat & light[/deletion] [insertion]light[/insertion] by compression which
is not the case with any other
elastic fluid except [deletion]chlorine & the[/deletion]
[deletion]other elastic fluids[/deletion] [insertion]those[/insertion] into which oxygene
has entered without undergoing combustion
& from the fire that it produces in
certain cases, & from the manner in
which it is separated by positive electricity
in the gaseous state from its combination
it is not easy to avoid the supposition
that it contains besides its ponduable
element some very subtle matter which

[page]160||dnp14b156pp|92018429[/page]
is capable of assuming the form of
heat & light. My idea is, that the
[deletion]oxygene gas of the[/deletion] common air inspire
enters into the venous blood [insertion]enter[/insertion] in a
static of dissolution, carrying with
it its subtile or etherial part, which
in ordinary cases of chemical change
is given off, it expels from [insertion]the blood[/insertion] it carbonic
acid gas: [insertion]& azote[/insertion] & that in the course of
the circulation its etherial part & its
ponderable part undergoes changes
which belong to laws that cannot
be considered as chemical - the etherial
part [insertion]probably[/insertion] producing animal heat & [deletion]probably[/deletion]
other affects; & the ponderable part
[deletion]producing[/deletion] [insertion]contributing to form[/insertion] the carbonic acid. The
arterial blood is necessary to all

[page]161||dnp14b157pp|92018430[/page]
157
the functions of life, & is no less
connected with the [unclear]irritability[/unclear] of
the muscles & sensibility of the nerves
than with the performance of all
the secretions. a
[deletion][underline]Phus.[/underline] I beg your pardon for
interrupting you but I cannot help
mentioning an analogy which seems
to me contrary to your supposition
& in favour of the idea that the
carbonic acid is formed & not
evolved in the respiration. The venous
blood is black & it becomes brighter
in respiration: would it not appear
from this that it actually lost
carbon?[/deletion]

[page]162||dnp14b158pp|92018431[/page]
[deletion][underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript].[/underline] A mere change of colour is[/deletion]
[deletion]no proof of the nature of a chemical[/deletion]
[deletion]change[/deletion]; It would not follow if carbon
were liberated from the blood that it
must necessarily become brighter sulphur
in combining with [deletion]iron[/deletion] [insertion]charcoal[/insertion] becomes a clear
fluid; & a black oxide of copper
becomes red in writing with a substance
which abounds in Carbon, - [deletion]Prussic gas[/deletion]
[deletion]or Cyanosene It was the loose analogy[/deletion]
[deletion]of the change of colour of the protoxide[/deletion]
[deletion]of iron by the action of oxygen which[/deletion]
[deletion]led to the rude chemical idea of the[/deletion]
[deletion]colour of the blood depending upon iron[/deletion]
[deletion]& its oxygenation.[/deletion] No change in sensible
qualities can ever indicate with precision
the nature of a chemical change,

[page]163||dnp14b159pp|92018432[/page]
159
[deletion]& the same substance which in one[/deletion]
[deletion]case seems to develope or produce[/deletion]
[deletion]acid qualities, in another case[/deletion]
[deletion]occasions or developes alkaline ones[/deletion]
[deletion]& a small quantity of a body gives[/deletion]
[deletion]a black colour to a white metal[/deletion]
[deletion]& a larger quantity renders it bright[/deletion]
[deletion]red or vermillion[/deletion]: I shall resume
my view which I cannot be said
to have fully developed. When I
said that carbonic acid was formed
in the venous blood in the process of
respiration, I meant merely to say
that this blood in consequences of
certain changes become capable of
giving off carbonic acid & oxygen in

[page]164||dnp14b160pp|92018433[/page]
union with each other: for the
moment inorganic matter enters into
the composition of living organs, it
obeys new laws, - we can no longer
reason upon the changes it undergoes
as chemical changes. The action of
the gastric juice is chemical & it
will only dissolve dead matters, & it
dissolves [underline]them[/underline] when they are in tubes
of metal, as well as in the stomach
but it has no action upon living matter
Respiration is no more a chemical process
than the absorption of chyle; & the
changes that take place in the lungs
though they [underline]appear[/underline] so simple, may
be very complicated: It is as little
philosophical to consider it as a mere

[page]165||dnp14b161pp|92018434[/page]
161
combustions of carbon, as to consider
the formation of muscle from the
arterial blood as chrystalization.
There can be no doubt that all the
powers & agencies of matter are employed
in the purposes of organization; but
the phenomenon of organization can
no more be referred to chemistry
than those of chemistry to mechanics
As oxygene stands in [insertion]electrical[/insertion] relation to the
other elements of animal matter which
[deletion]I have called electroposition[/deletion] [insertion]has been called [unclear]electroportive[/unclear][/insertion], it may be
supposed that some electrical function
is exercised by oxygen in the blood,
but this is mere hypothesis. An
attempt has been made founded
upon the experiments on the decomposition

[page]166||dnp14b162pp|92018435[/page]
of bodies by Electricity to explain
secretion by weak electrical powers
& to imagine the glands electrical
organs [insertion]& even to imagine the action of the nerves[/insertion]. These like all other notions
of the same kind appears to me
very little refined: if electrical effects
be the exhibition of certain powers
generally belonging to matter [insertion]which is a [unclear]fine[/unclear][/insertion] [deletion]as I have[/deletion]
[deletion]supposed[/deletion] [insertion]supposition[/insertion], then no change can take place
without their being more or less concerned
[deletion]in it; but there seems no occasion for[/deletion] [insertion]but to apply the word electricity[/insertion]
[deletion]an electrical combinations to effect[/deletion] [insertion]to solve phaenomena the rationalle[/insertion]
[deletion]what may be produced without it;[/deletion] [insertion]of which is unknown is merely to[/insertion]
[deletion]& indeed there is no evidence of these[/deletion] [insertion]substitute one undefined word[/insertion]
[deletion]organs being of this nature.[/deletion] [insertion]for another[/insertion] In some
animals electrical organs are found
but then they furnish the artillery

[page]167||dnp14b163pp|92018436[/page]
163
of the animal, & means of [deletion]attack[/deletion]
&[insertion]seizing its prey & its[/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] defence; & speculations of this kind
must be ranked with those belonging
[insertion]dependent upon electricity[/insertion]
to the followers of the Newtonian
philosophy, who explained the properties
of animated nature by mechanical
powers; & muscular action by the
expansion & contraction of elastic [unclear]bladders[/unclear]
Man in this stage of philosophy was
[insertion]imagined[/insertion] a species of hydraulic machine
When the pneumatic chemistry was
invented, he became a laboratory in
which combinations & decomposition
produced all the effects of living
{insertion]when muscular contraction was supposed as [unclear]exple[/unclear] &[/insertion]action: & now that the progress
of electrical science has opened new
& extraordinary views in [insertion]the[/insertion] phyisical
formation of blood from chyle [deletion]a chem[/deletion][insertion]as a [unclear]xxxx xxxxxx[/unclear][/insertion] 

[page]168||dnp14b164pp|92018437[/page]
[deletion]science[/deletion], these views are not unnaturally
applied to solve some of the mysteries
& recondite phenomena of organized
beings
[deletion]Phus.[/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] I conclude from what you
have last said, that though you are
inclined to believe that some unknown
[unclear]subtile[/unclear] matter is added to the organizing
system by respiration, yet you would
not have us believe that this is electricity
or that there is any reason to believe
that electricity has a peculiar & especial
share in producing the functions of life
Philo[superscript]s[/superscript] [insertion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion], I wish to guard you against
the adoption of any hypothesis on
this recondite & abstruse subject; but
however difficult it may be to refine

[page]169||dnp14b165pp|92018438[/page]
165
the exact nature of [deletion]the chemical[/deletion]
[deletion]process[/deletion] of respiration; yet the effect
of it & its connections with the functions
of life are sufficiently shocking. By
the action of air on the blood it
is fitted for the purposes of life
& from the moment that animation
is marked by sensation or volition
this function is performed. The [underline]functions[/underline]
saliens in the ovum seems to receive
as it were the breath of life in the
influx of air; [deletion]& the scripture term
giving up the Ghost, is [unclear]merely[/unclear] a forcible
expression of ceasing to breathe.[/deletion]
In the economy of generations one of
the most important circumstances is the
aeration of the ovum; when this is

[page]170||dnp14b166pp|92018439[/page]
not performed from the blood of the
mother, as in the mammalia by the
placenta, there is a system for
aerating as in the ova [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] viparous
reptiles or fishes, which enables the air
freely to pass through the receptacles
in which the eggs are deposited,
or the egg itself is aerated out of the
body through its coat or shells.
In the eggs of birds the air penetrates
through the shell; & when the air is
excluded, incubation or artificial
heat has no effect. Fishes which
deposit their eggs in water which
contains only a limited portion of air
make combinations which would seem
about the result of scientific knowledge

[page]171||dnp14b167pp|92018440[/page]
167
or reason [deletion]rather than instinct, for[/deletion] [insertion]though depending upon a more [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/insertion]
principle, their instinct for
preserving their offspring. These fishes
that spawn in spring or the beginning
of summer which inhabit deep
or still waters, as the carp, bream
pike, tench &c, deposit their eggs
upon aquatic vegetables, which by
the influence of the solar light
constantly preserve the water in
a state of aeration. The trout,
salmon [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] & others of the Salmo
genus, which spawn in the beginning
or end of winter & which inhabit
rivers fed by cold & rapid streams
that descend from the mountains, deposit
their eggs in shallow heaps of gravel

[page]172||dnp14b168pp|92018441[/page]
[deletion]as near as possible to the source
of the stream where the water is
fully combined with air; & to
accomplish this purpose they travel
for hundreds of miles against the current
& leap over cataracts & dams. Thus
the [underline]Salmo Salai[/underline] ascends by the Rhine
Switzerland; & the huco by the Danube
the Drave, & the Save[/deletion] - passing through
the lakes of Illyria & [deletion]Carniola[/deletion] [insertion]Styria[/insertion] to the
highest [deletion]alpine[/deletion] torrents of the [deletion]syrah,[/deletion]
[unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] & [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] Alps. -
[deletion]Illyria & Carinthia[/deletion]
P. As a very small part - only of
the solid materials of the globe are [unclear]useful[/unclear]
in organized life; so in the atmosphere

[page]173||dnp14b169pp|92018442[/page]
169
the great constituent part appears
inert. You have dwelt - so much
upon & considered so much the harmony
of the system of the Globe, that
perhaps you can find some reason
for this.
[deletion][underline]Pol,[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]Eubath[/insertion] I was about to make a
similar observation. Why could
not the whole of our planet have
been formed of compounds of the
same kind as those formed in vegetables
or animals, & the atmosphere have
been entirely composed of oxygen. Why
could it not have supplied nourishment
to myriads of millions of inhabitants
in the same manner as a Cheshire
Cheese supplies food to mites; & of

[page]174||dnp14b170pp|92018443[/page]
what use are its profound rocks,
its desarts of siliceous sand, its
elevated heaps of granite, & its glaciers
unconnected with any of the necessities [insertion]uses[/insertion]
of life, & unhaunted by any of its forms
Phil.[superscript]s[/superscript] That there may be in the
infinity of combinations or circumstances
belonging to things a world composed
entirely of matter capable of being
organized, is extremely probable; but
it must be a world very different
from ours, which is intended as a
theatre of action: for man is a most
intellectual being, - a being who
requires space to move in, matter to
modify, difficulties to overcome; whose
eyes are made to see, whose hands

[page]175||dnp14b171pp|92018444[/page]
171
to labour, who from the profound
luck, produces metal by which he
builds houses, cities, & ships, and
materials for investigating the nature
of the universe; who is capable of
improving even a desart of sand, which
sometimes marks on exhausted soil
the result of his indolence or his
avarice. But even the desart & the
mountain have their uses; both
produce those inequalities of temperature
by which the parts of the atmosphere
are blended together by winds. In
a globe revolving round the sun,
organized life such as it is formed in
our system, could not have existed
without unorganised matter; and when

[page]176||dnp14b172pp|92018445[/page]
rising in the atmosphere in a balloon
or sailing on the ocean, or penetrating
into space by optical inventions &
measuring worlds which he can never
reach, is in my opinion an object
somewhat nobler, than ten millions of
maggots, - even supposing them colossal,
feeding on mountains of cheese; or than
an universe of flies, feasting & propagating
upon carrion. A life in which no
faculties are employed but those [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
or generating, would approach to that
of an [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] [deletion]or[/deletion] polypus, or even a fungus
& it is only to suppose a simple kind
of perception concealed with the arrangement
of new parts, & the growth & seeding of a
flower, or the aggregation of a [unclear]chrystal[/unclear]]

[page]177||dnp14b173pp|92018446[/page]
173
would be the kind of being which
you seem to require for a perfect system
[deletion][underline]Pol[/underline][/deletion][insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] It is to me very doubtful whether
the dignity of intellectual enjoyment
renders it more desirable than mere
sensual pleasure; & if the oyster
could make a scale of pleasures &
perceive that of the man, it is
possible that it might prefer its
own existence.
[underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript].[/underline] The oyster never can make
the scale; the human being can.
He can compare the pleasure he
derives from the eye with that he
derives from the ear & the palate.
Who is there that would not give up

[page]178||dnp14b174pp|92018447[/page]
smell rather than taste, taste rather
than hearing, hearing rather than
sight; & if it could be imagined
possible, his resigning the ideal or
intellectual life, or that of appetite
& sense; Who would not prefer
imagination, hope & desire to sensations
- [unclear]even[/unclear] organic feelings & movements.
[underline]Poet.[/underline] This part of your argument
recalls to my mind what I had
intended to mention before,- One of the
most important subjects connected
with the historical destiny of Man as
an intellectual being. Does any thing
belonging to the phenomenon of  respiration
the dependence of life upon such sligh

[page]179||dnp14b175pp|92018448[/page]
175
natural causes offer any argument
in favour of materialism, which supposes
thought a result of organization, &
not dependent upon any peculiar
immaterial necessarily sentient principle?
[deletion][underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript].[/underline][/deletion][insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] If by materialism you mean
[deletion]that doctrine which supposes that[/deletion] the supposition that
any number of molecules , atoms or
finely divided matter, not in themselves
possessed of the power of perception
can derive that power from their
division, arrangements, or juxta position
nothing can appear to me more absurd
than such a doctrine; & there is
nothing in any of the [deletion]chemical[/deletion] facts
belonging either to organized or unorganized

[page]180||dnp14b176pp|92018449[/page]
matter which offers the least support
to such a gratuitous hypothesis. In truth
Matter itself, the external world, is to
us nothing but a heap or cluster of
sensations; & in examining the history
of our being we find one principle
constantly associating itself, first with
a particular class of sensations called
organs, which themselves bring in trains
of other sensations, deriving from these
[insertion]new[/insertion] sensations moving as it were in [deletion]a[/deletion]
circles of [insertion]identical[/insertion] existence, quitting for a time
Some trains to return to others, but
always sentient. We can fix no beginning
to its operations; we can place no limit
to them; we sometimes lose the beginning
& end of a dream & recollect the middle

[page]181||dnp14b177pp|92018450[/page]
177
of it, & one dream has little or no
connection with another; yet we
are conscious of an infinite variety
of dreams: and there is the same
analogy for believing an infinity of
past existences, which must have had
connection though we cannot trace
it: indeed it is in the nature of
our present existence, that its past or
former being should be forgotten,
as the earliest part, or the useless part
of its present being, when the child
was in the womb of its mother.[insertion]or in the nascent or early infant state[/insertion]. That
the operations of mind may prepare it
after it has quitted the aggregate of
sensations called organs & matter & this
terrestrial universe for its new state

[page]182||dnp14b178pp|92018451[/page]
of existence is extremely probable &
according to the analogy of nature;
but the [deletion]nature[/deletion][insertion]kind[/insertion] of this existence we can
never know from reason; & revelation
teaches us to expect something of a
more ethereal & diffusive kind, in which
sensations will be produced by something
analogous to the harmony of sounds
perhaps a pure kind of intellectual
life which may prepare [insertion]us[/insertion] for something
still more exalted.
[deletion][underline]Pol:[/underline][/deletion][insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] I do not see the correctness of
the analogy which you endeavour to
establish between dreams & a variety of
independent existences: though dreams
have no connections with each other, yet
they evidently are related to the state

[page]183||dnp14b179pp|92018452[/page]
179
of our mind & organs, & are mere
repetitions or new combinations of ideas
gained during our waking existence
If we even had a new sense in dreaming
your analogy would be correct; but even
the visions of Mahomet & other pretended
prophets gave us only monstrous
Combinations of Sensations or thoughts
belonging to common life: & all that
has been learned respecting the nature of
heaven from the visions of these pretended
Confidants of providence, might have
been acquired by a dream or a drunken
fit on earth.
[deletion][underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript][/underline][/deletion] [insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] Our language represents only
thoughts which belong to the objects of
our daily existence, therefore a being

[page]184||dnp14b180pp|92018453[/page]
who had new senses or new perceptions
could never be understood; & if he
invented a language to express them,
his language likewise would be
unintelligible; [deletion]so that the expression[/deletion]
[deletion]"The eye hath not seen, nor the ear heard[/deletion]
[deletion]nor has entered into the heart of[/deletion]
[deletion]Man to conceive the joys that He[/deletion]
[deletion]has prepared for those that love him"[/deletion]
[deletion]may be considered as a strictly logical[/deletion]
[deletion]expression of a state of existence entirely[/deletion]
[deletion]new, & to which none of our analogies[/deletion]
[deletion]or experience can apply[/deletion] [insertion]but[/insertion] There is probably
no person who has not had in the course
of his life sensations which were quite
indescribable; of this kind are the sensation
produced in some persons by opium,

[page]185||dnp14b181pp|92018454[/page]
181
[deletion]& in many by the inhalation of the[/deletion]
[deletion]nitrous oxide.[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]Pol.[/underline][/deletion][insertion]Eu[/insertion] It appears to me rather
[deletion]unfortunate for your train of argument[/deletion]
[deletion]that such sensation should be always[/deletion]
[deletion]produced by some [deletion]un[/deletion]known physical[/deletion]
[deletion]agent, & not by any of those unknown[/deletion]
[deletion]& extraordinary acts of the mind when[/deletion]
[deletion]it might be seeking new intellectual[/deletion]
[deletion]combinations.[/deletion]Besides if you allow
a peculiar principle necessary to [deletion]sensation[/deletion]
[insertion]intelligence[/insertion] it must exist throughout animated
nature. The elephant approaches nearer
to man in intellectual powers than
the oyster does to the elephant, & a
link of sensitive natures may be traced

[page]186||dnp14b182pp|92018455[/page]
from the polypus to the philosopher
Now in the polypus the sentient principle
is divisible, & from one polypus or one
earthworm may be formed two or three
all of which become perfect animals
& have perception & volition: therefore
at least the sentient principle has
this property in common with matter
that it is divisible. Again; there
was a period when the greatest
philosopher or poet or statesman or hero
that ever existed was a mere living
atom,- an organised form with the
powers of feeling: & the combinations
that a Newton formed before birth
perhaps were little superior to those of
an oyster. There is not the slightest

[page]187||dnp14b183pp|92018456[/page]
183
proof of any habits, associations
or ideas, derived from a former state
of existence; & it is difficult or
perhaps impossible to decide, whether
the living principle slumbers in
the ovum of the female, & is awakened
by some influence from the male; or
whether the spark of life is
introduced in the semen of the male
in either case, it must have remained
dormant for years in the ovarium
of the one or the testicles of the other
or it must have been introduced
into the system in nourishment
which had no character of life,-
which had been digested in the stomach
& circulated in the blood. Or

[page]188||dnp14b184pp|92018457[/page]
Do you suppose that the first [unclear]Men[/unclear]
Contained all the germs of Sentient
beings afterwards to people the earth
Or will you recur to the monstrous
supposition that the Soul is introduced
into the body at some particular period
of gestation. Again, add to all
these difficulties, [deletion]the still greater one[/deletion]
[deletion]of the gradual elevation & decay of[/deletion]
[deletion]the thinking powers, with the exaltation[/deletion]
[deletion]& decline of the corporeal ones - the[/deletion]
[deletion]imbecility of infancy, the energy of youth[/deletion]
[deletion]the strength of manhood, & the feebleness[/deletion]
[deletion]& dotage of old age;[/deletion] the dependace of
all the higher faculties of the mind
upon the state of the brain; the suspension
of animation [insertion]as in the case of our friend[/insertion] [deletion]for hours in which there[/deletion]

[page]189||dnp14b185pp|92018458[/page]
185
[insertion]when[/insertion] are no signs of life, & in which
there is not the slightest recollection
of any thing but the accident which
occasioned the suspended animation;
the return of life with the return
of organic action;- take, I say, all
these circumstances & they appear to me
[insertion]in favour of the idea that thought[/insertion] [deletion]to amount almost to a demonstration[/deletion]
[deletion]as far as a physical reasoning can apply[/deletion]
[deletion]of the dependence of the thinking powers[/deletion]
[insertion]depends[/insertion] upon the organization of the body.
[deletion][underline]Philo[superscript]s[/superscript][/underline][/deletion] [insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] You have collected or
[unclear]reinserted[/unclear] most of the strong arguments
in favour of materialism, that have been
current from the time of Lucretius to
that of Priestly. It appears to me

[page]190||dnp14b186pp|92018459[/page]
that the advantages the immaterialists
have given to their opponents have
depended principally upon their not
allowing the force of these arguments,
& in waving them by enveloping the
subject in mystery & absurdity, rather
than meeting them boldly. It appears
to me necessary to allow that the process
of thought, or that our trains of sensations
ideas, pleasures, & pains, depend upon
or to use a more proper phrase, are
connected, with that class of sensations
Called organs; & that with the dissolution
of our organization that kind of life
which we have been accustomed to
will cease: but because the connections

[page]191||dnp14b187pp|92018460[/page]
187
of thoughts have ceased, it does not
follow that the principle which
perceived these thoughts can be
annihilated. It is supposed that
at atom of light strikes upon the
retina & occasions a sensation of
vision; but this is expressing nothing
more than that the sensation of vision
is connected with certain other sensations
The sensation itself I suppose to be
composed of indestructible parts, which
in their aggregate produce the effects.
I appears to me absurd to talk of
something which is not thought producing
thought; for in fact we are secure of
the existence of nothing but thought, or
if we chuse to call it so - spirit: &

[page]192||dnp14b188pp|92018461[/page]
what is called organization is nothing
more than a system in which thought
& feeling are constantly in action. The
existence of something independent of
intellectual existence is quite uncertain
It may be said that a chair,- a
table, or the whole of this visible universe
would still be in being even there
was no intellectual [insertion]nature[/insertion] to perceive it; but
the only reasonable supposition is that
its existence is derived from & entirely
dependent upon the mind: All that
man can ever do is such inquiries is
to give an history of his own intellect
He supposes by analogy that the universe
will exist when he perceives it no
more, because he knows from the

[page]193||dnp14b189pp|92018462[/page]
189
experience of others, that certain
sources of sensation are common to
all sentient beings. With respect
to your first argument the [deletion]division[/deletion]
indivisibility of the sentient principle
you can in no wise prove it by
the instance you have brought
forward, than you can prove it to
be divisible by the circumstance of
an animal producing young ones;
but even allowing this, it does not
shew its mortality or destructibility
That from one sentient being can be
formed two sentient beings does not
demonstrate either the creation or the
annihilation of sensation by arrangements
of matter. It is contrary to all the

[page]194||dnp14b190pp|92018463[/page]
principles of sound logic to endeavour
to prove the nullity or non-existence
of a quality by proving that it can
be multiplied or increased. X -
having answered your argument drawn
from the pretended divisibility of the
sentient principle, I shall now reply
to that founded upon the growth, [unclear]increase[/unclear]
maturity, & decay of the intellectual power
with the growth, increase, maturity &
decay of the [deletion]intellectual powers [/deletion][insertion]body As[/insertion] what
you call body represents the sensations
Called organs, it is evident that in
a system like ours, if the sensations
are altered their corresponding ideas must
be likewise altered; & when the sense
of vision is affected the ideas now

[page]195||dnp14b191pp|92018464[/page]
191
received must correspond to the
primary sensation, & to expect the
same vivacity of sensation in an old
man & a youth, would be to expect
to see equally well through a clear
glass & one covered with smoke;
but there is still the one [underline]sentient[/underline]
[underline]principle[/underline]. To suppose that because
the organs are affected, this is likewise
diminished, would be to suppose that
a man maimed in battle & deprived
of his eyes & half his limbs, was maimed
in soul - was deprived of half his soul
That is all the [deletion]operations & powers of the [/deletion][insertion] ideas belonging to the Mind[/insertion]

[deletion]called organs, it is impossible[/deletion] [insertion]called organs[/insertion] to deny

[deletion]mathematical truths depend upon the[/deletion]
[deletion]signs which express them; but these[/deletion]
[deletion]signs themselves are not the truths[/deletion]
nor are the organs the mind. The

[deletion]of change, but change according to a[/deletion]

[deletion]only of these changes which are useful [/deletion]
[deletion]to us, or connected with our future[/deletion]

[deletion]what happened to it in the womb; all[/deletion]
[deletion]the recollections of the infant are lost,[/deletion]
[deletion]because they would be useless to an[/deletion]

[deletion]is as it were falling asleep to awake[/deletion]

[deletion]to its nature as a percipient monad[/deletion]
[deletion]that it should change its organs[/deletion]

[deletion]Were the human being to be immortal[/deletion]
[deletion]with its present frame, it would in fact[/deletion]

[deletion]the derangement of the intellectual powers[/deletion]

me to have far inferior relations to

metals of our electrical machines, have
to the charge. A Leydn jar cannot
be charged, if the smallest communication
be made between the inner & outer
coatings; but the law of the mechanism
of the charge is quite independent of
these coatings. From the rapidity -
the infinite variety of the phenomena of
perception, it seems that even these
material proximate instruments which
form its machinery, must be a nature
far more subtile than any thing
found by observation or experiment in
the brain & nerves: & the finer & more
etherial kinds of matter which are produced

or act in the organs, may bear the
same relations to heat, light & electricity
that these refined modes or forms of
matter bear to the gasses. The brain
may be a machine producing by
some unknown functions combinations
of etherial matter sensible to mind
& possessing powers unknown to us, in
the same manner as the plates & fluids
of a galvanic battery produces a
peculiar circulation of electricity,
known by its chemical electrical &
magnetic effects, & which cannot be
considered as having any more relation
to metals & fluids, than thought has
to the brain.

[underline]Pol.[/underline] Your doctrine approaches to mi
for with the exception of a sentient
principle which you allow may sleep
or cease to be sentient; you make every
thing else dependent upon organs, & you
allow the new state of existence to be
entirely independent of this, as this was
of the last, so that all feelings, thoughts
habits, gained in this earth are lost for
heaven; & if we forget our past existence
we are in fact new beings; & unless
I remember that I was P. here, I might
as well be the soul of Caesar or Alexander
Moreover, as organs give powers, so they
give virtues or infirmities, & I cannot
imagine why the sentient principle
should be punished [deletion]for[/deletion] or rewarded for
what it could not command or avoid

[page]203||dnp14b199pp|92018472[/page]
199
A particular organization of the [deletion]penis[/deletion]
[deletion]or ovarium[/deletion][insertion]parts intended for reproduction [/insertion]gives Sensual pleasure
which becomes inordinate & occasions
immorality: This is not the fault
of the sentient principle, any more
than its chastity depending upon
feeble generative organs is a virtue, &
that organization is hereditary is certain
& the sin in Adam seems metaphorical
of this.
[underline]Philo[/underline][superscript]s[/superscript] what Divine wisdom considers

laws in Nature by which they are

[insertion]friend[/insertion]the goodness to give[insertion] to give[/insertion] us some ideas
[insertion]in his character of Chemical [unclear]Philosopher[/unclear][/insertion] on this subject. If human science
has discovered the principles of the
decay of things, it is possible that

[page]206||dnp14b202pp|92018475[/page]
human art may supply some
means of conservation, & bestow an
immortality on some of the works
of future ages.
[deletion]Philo[/deletion][superscript]s[/superscript][insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] I shall willingly communicate
to you my views of the operation of
Time, [deletion]chemically[/deletion][insertion]philosphically[/insertion]considered, but as
a great Philosopher has said, Man
can in no otherwise command Nature
but in obeying her laws; & in these
laws the principle of change is a
principle of life: without decay there
can be no reproduction; & every
thing belonging to the earth, whether
in its primitive state or modified by
human hands, is submitted to certain

[page]207||dnp14b203pp|92018476[/page]
203
& immutable laws of destruction &
renovation as permanent & universal
as those which produce the planetary
motions. The property which as
far as our experience extends [unclear]universally[/unclear]
belongs to matter, [underline]gravitation[/underline], is the
first & most general cause of change
in our terrestrial system: & whilst
it preserves the great mass of the
globe in an uniform state, its
influence is continually producing
changes upon its surface. If water
raised in vapour by the Solar heat
is precipitated by the cool air in the
Atmosphere, it is carried down by
gravitation to the surface & gains

[page]208||dnp14b204pp|92018477[/page]
its mechanical form from this law
whatever is elevated above the surface
by the power of vegetation, or animal
life, or by the efforts of man, by
gravitation constantly tends to the[insertion][unclear] common[/unclear][/insertion]
Centre of attraction; & the great
reason of the duration of the Pyramid
above other forms is, that it is the
most fitted to resist the force of
gravitation. The arch, the pillar, &
all perpendicular constructions are liable
to fall when a degradation from
Chemical or mechanical causes takes
place in their inferior parts. The forms
upon the surface of the globe are
preserved from the influence of

[page]209||dnp14b205pp|92018478[/page]
205
gravitation, by the attraction of
cohesion, or by chemical attraction
but if these facts had freedom of
motion, they would all be levelled
by this force, & the globe would
appear as a plain & smooth oblate
spheroid, flattened at the poles
The attraction of cohesion, or chemistry
is not capable of being destroyed
by gravitation. This power only
assists the agencies of other causes
of degradation, Attraction of whatever
kind tends as it were to produce
rest - a sort of eternal sleep in nature
The great antagonist power is [underline]heat[/underline].
By the influence of the Sun the globe

[page]210||dnp14b206pp|92018479[/page]
is exposed to great varieties of
temperature: an addition of heat
expands bodies; & an abstraction of
heat causes them to contract. By
variations of heat, certain kinds of
matter are rendered fluid or elastic
& changes from fluid into solids, or [insertion]from[/insertion]
solids [deletion]in[/deletion]fluids into elastic substances
& vice versa, are produced; & all these
phenomena are connected with [unclear]altera[/unclear]
in solid matter. It is not probable
that the mere contraction or expansion
of a solid, from the subtraction or
addition of heat would tend to
loosen its parts; but if water exists
in these parts, then its expansion either
in becoming vapour or ice, tends not

[page]211||dnp14b207pp|92018480[/page]
207
only to diminish their cohesion,
but to break them into fragments
I have explained to you on a former
occasion that very remarkable
property of water, its expansion by
Cooling, & [deletion]by[/deletion] at the time of becoming ice
& this is a great cause of destruction
in the northern climate, for when
ice forms in the crevices or cavities of
Stones, or when water which has
penetrated into cement has frozen
its expansion acts with the force
of the lever or the screw [insertion]screw[/insertion] in destroying
or separating. The mechanical power
of water as rain hail or snow in
descending from the atmosphere are not
entirely without effect; for in acting

[page]212||dnp14b208pp|92018481[/page]
upon the projecting points of solids
drops of water, or particles of snow, &
still more of hail have a power of abrasion
and a very soft substance by its mass
assisting gravitation, may break a
much harder one. The glacier by its motion
grinds into powder the [insertion]surface of the[/insertion] granite rock
& the alpine torrents that have their
origin under glaciers are always
turbid from the destruction of the
rocks on which the glacier is formed
The effect of a torrent in deepening its
bed well shews the mechanical
agency of fluid water, though this
effect is infinitely increased & sometimes
almost entirely dependent upon the solid
matters which are carried down by it

[page]213||dnp14b209pp|92018482[/page]
209
An angular fragment of stone in
the course of ages moved in the cavity
of a rock, makes a deep round
excavation, & its[insertion]2[/insertion]elf is [insertion]1[/insertion]worn into a
spherical form. A torrent of rain
flowing down the side of a building
carries with it the siliceous dust
or sand, or matter which the wind
has deposited there, & acts upon a scale
infinitely more minute, but according
to the same law. The buildings of
ancient Rome have not only been
liable to the constantly operation of
the [insertion]rain courses or minute[/insertion] torrents produced by rains; but
even the Tiber, swollen with the floods
of the Sabine Mountains & the Apennines

[page]214||dnp14b210pp|92018483[/page]
[insertion]has [/insertion]often entered into the City; & a
winter seldom passes away in which
the [insertion]area[/insertion] area of the Pantheon has not
been filled with water, & the reflection
of the Cupola seen in a smooth lake
below.- The monuments of Egypt
are perhaps the most [insertion]ancient &[/insertion] permanent; *
[insertion]of these belonging to the earth and[/insertion][deletion]when their antiquity is considered, have [/deletion] 
[deletion]suffered least of all those belonging[/deletion]
[deletion]to our globe;[/deletion] & in that country rain
is unknown. And all the causes
of degradation connected with the
agency of water act more in the
temperate climates than in the hot
ones, & most of all in those countries
where the inequalities of temperature are

[page]215||dnp14b211pp|92018484[/page]
211
greatest. The mechanical effects
of air are principally in the
action of winds in assisting the
operation of gravitation , & in abrading
by dust, sand , stones, & atmospheric
water, Their effects unless it be
in the case of a building blown
down by a tempest, are imperceptible
in days, or even years; yet a gentle
current of air carrying the silicious
Sand of the desert or the dust of
a road for ages against the face
of a structure must ultimately tend
to injure it; for with infinite [insertion]or[/insertion] unlimited
duration, an extremely small cause
will produce a very great effect

[page]216||dnp14b212pp|92018485[/page]
|_The mechanical agency of Electricity
is very limited : the effects of lightning
have however been witnessed even in
[insertion]some of the great monuments[/insertion][deletion]the very building in which we now[/deletion]

first considered them separately & then
their joint effect.
underline][deletion]Phil[/deletion][/underline][insertion]The Unknown[/insertion] The order that I have adopted
is not very remote from this; but
I was perhaps wrong in treating first
of the agency of gravitation, which
owes almost all its power to the
operation of other causes [insertion]In consequence of your hint I shall alter[/insertion]. [deletion]I shall[/deletion]

[page]218||dnp14b214pp|92018487[/page]
Electricity.
In every species of Chemical change,
temperature is [deletion]considered [/deletion][insertion]concerned [/insertion]; but unless
the effects of Volcanos & earthquakes

[insertion]but [/insertion] its [deletion]effects[/deletion][insertion]operations[/insertion], which are the most important
belonging to the terrestrial cycle of
Changes, are blended with, or bring
into activity those of other agents
One of the most distinct & destructive
agencies of water depends upon its
[underline]solvent[/underline] powers, which are usually greatest
when its temperature is highest. Water
is capable of dissolving in larger or

[page]219||dnp14b215pp|92018488[/page]
215
smaller proportions, most compound
bodies; & the calcareous & alkaline
elements of stones are particularly liable
to this kind of operation, When water
holds in solution carbonic acid
which is always the case when it
is precipitated from the atmosphere
its power of dissolving carbonate
of lime is very much increased:
& in the neighbourhood of great
cities, where the atmosphere contains
a larger proportion of this principle
the solvent powers of rain upon the
marble exposed to it must be
greatest. Whoever examines the
marble statues which have been

[page]220||dnp14b216pp|92018489[/page]
removed from the Parthenon, will
be convinced that they have suffered
from this agency ; & an effect distinct
in the pure atmosphere & temperate
climate of Greece, must be upon a
greater scale in the vicinity of great
European Cities, where the consumption
of fuel produces carbonic acid in
large quantities.-
Metallic substances, such as Iron,
Copper, [insertion]Bronze[/insertion] Brass, Tin & Lead, whether they
all exist in stones or are used for
support or connection in buildings
are liable to be corroded by water
holding in Solution the principles of
the Atmosphere; and the rust &

[page]221||dnp14b217pp|92018490[/page]
217
corrosion which are made poetically
qualities of time, depend upon the
oxydating powers of water; which
by supplying oxygene in a dissolved
or condensed state, enables the metals
to form new combinations.
All vegetable substances exposed to
water & air are liable to decay;
& even the vapour in the air, attracted
by wood, gradually reacts upon its
fibres & assists decomposition, or
enables its elements to take new
arrangements: hence it is that
none of the [underline]roofs[/underline] of ancient buildings
remain, unless it be those constituted
of stone, such as [insertion]those [deletion]that[/deletion]of[/insertion] the Pantheon of Rome

[page]222||dnp14b218pp|92018491[/page]
[deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]& of [/insertion] the tomb of Theodoric at Ravenna
the cupola of which is composed of
a single block of Marble. The
pictures of the Greek masters which
were painted on [insertion]the wood of [/insertion] the Abies [insertion]or pine of the mediterranean[/insertion] likewise
as we are informed by Pliny, owed
their [deletion]change or[/deletion] destruction, not to a
[deletion]the[/deletion] change in the colours - not to
the alteration of the [insertion]calcareous ground[/insertion] on which
they were painted, but to the decay
of the tablets of wood on which the
intonaco [insertion]or stucco[/insertion] [deletion]or plaister[/deletion] was laid.
Amongst the substances employed in
building, wood, iron, tin & lead are
most likely to decay from the operation
of water, then marble, when it it is

[page]223||dnp14b219pp|92018492[/page]
219
exposed to its influence in the
fluid form. Brass, Copper, granite
Sienite & porphyry are more durable
but in stones, much depends upon
the peculiar nature of their [deletion][unclear]peculiar[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]conxtituent [/unclear][/deletion][insertion]constituent [/insertion]parts. When the feldspar
of the granite rocks contains little
alkali or calcareous earth, it is a
very permanent stone; but when in
granite, porphyry or Sienite, either
the feldspar contains much alkaline
matter, or the mica, shoerl, or
hornblende, much protoxide of iron,
the action of water containing carbonic
acid on the alkaline ingredients, & of
water containing oxygen & carbonic

[page]224||dnp14b220pp|92018493[/page]
acid on the ferruginous elements
tend to produce the disintegration of
of the stone. The [underline]red granite,[/underline] black
Sienite, & red porphyry of Egypt,
which are seen at Rome in pyramids
Columns, & sarcophagi, are amongst
the most durable compound stones,
but the grey granite of Corsica or
Elba are extremely liable to undergo
alteration the feldspar contains
much alkaline matter; & the mica
& shoerl, much protoxide of iron.
A remarkable instance of the decay
of granite may be seen in the
hanging tower at Pisa: whilst the
marble pillars in the basement remain

[page]225||dnp14b221pp|92018494[/page]
221
scarcely altered, the granite ones
have lost a considerable portion
of their surface, which falls off
Continually in scales, & exhibits
everywhere stains from the formation
of peroxide of iron.
The Kaolin or clay used in
most countries for the manufacture
of fine porcelain or china is generally
produced from  the feldspar of
decomposing granite in which the
cause of decay is the dissolution &
separation of the alkaline ingredients
[deletion][underline]Po[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]Eubathes[/insertion]. I have seen Serpentines, basalt
& lavas which internally were dark
& which from their weight I should

[page]226||dnp14b222pp|92018495[/page]
suppose must contain oxide of iron
superficially, brown or red [insertion]&[/insertion] decomposing
Undoubtedly this was from the action
of water impregnated with air upon
their ferruginous element.
[deletion][underline]Philo[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]The Unknown.[/insertion] You are perfectly right-;
there are few compound stones possessing
a considerable specific gravity which
are not liable to change from this
Cause, & oxide of iron amongst the
[underline]metallic substances anciently known[/underline]
is the most generally diffused in Nature
& most concerned in the changes which
take place on the surface of the globe,
The chemical action of [insertion]carbonic[/insertion] acid is so much
connected with that of water as must

[page]227||dnp14b223pp|92018496[/page]
223
be evident from what I have
often said, that it is scarcely
possible to speak of them separately
but the same action which is
exerted by the elements of the acid
dissolved in water is likewise
exerted by them in their elastic
State; & in this case [deletion]the quantity[/deletion]
[deletion]&[/deletion] the facility with which the
quantity is changed, makes up for
the difference of the degree of
condensation. There is no reason
to believe that the azote of the
Atmosphere has any action in producing
changes on the surface; the aqueous
vapour, the oxygene, & the carbonic

[page]228||dnp14b224pp|92018497[/page]
acid gas are however constantly
in activity, & above all the oxygene
And while [deletion]this[/deletion] [deletion]principle[/deletion] [insertion]Water[/insertion] combining
its effects with those of carbonic
acid tends to disintegrate the parts
of stones, the oxygen acts upon all
vegetable matter: and this great
Chemical [deletion]principle[/deletion] [insertion]agent[/insertion] is at once necessary
in all the processes of life, & in all
those of decay, in which Nature as
it were takes to herself those
instruments, organs, & powers which had
for a while been borrowed [insertion]and employed[/insertion][deletion]or occupied[/deletion]
for the purposes [deletion]of[/deletion][insertion]or[/insertion] the Wants of the
living principle. Almost every
thing effected by rapid combinations

[page]229||dnp14b225pp|92018498[/page]

in combustion, may also be effected
slowly, & gradually by the absorption
of oxygene; & though the production
of the animal & vegetable kingdom
are much more submitted to the
power of Atmospheric agents than
those of the mineral kingdom, yet
as in the instances which have
just been mentioned, oxygene gradually
destroys the equilibrium of the
elements of stones & tends to reduce
into powder & to render fit for
Soils even the hardest aggregates
belonging to our globe.
Electricity as a chemical agent
may be considered not only as producing

[page]230||dnp14b226pp|92018499[/page]
an infinite variety of changes; but
likewise as influencing all that take
place. There are no two substances
on the surface of the globe that
are not in different electrical relation
to each other; & chemical attraction
itself seems but to be a peculiar
form of the exhibition of electrical
attraction: & whenever the atmosphere
or water or any part of the surface
of the earth, gains accumulated
electricity of a different kind from
the contiguous surface, the tendency
of this electricity is to produce new
arrangements of the part[insertion]s[/insertion] of those
surfaces: thus a positively electrified

cloud acting upon a moistened
surface of stone, [deletion]by its electrical[/deletion]
[deletion]powers[/deletion] tends to attract its [deletion]oxy[unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion][unclear]oxygency[/unclear][/insertion]
or acidiform or acid ingredients:
& a ) negatively electrified cloud has
the same effect upon its earthy
alkaline, or metallic matter; &
the silent & slow operation of
electricity is much more important
in the economy of nature than its
grand & impressive operation in
lightning & thunder. The chemical
[deletion]operations[/deletion][insertion]agencies[/insertion] [insertion]agencies[/insertion] of water & air are assisted
by [insertion]those of[/insertion] electricity [deletion]& by heat[/deletion]; & their joint
effects combined with [deletion]heat, of[/deletion] of[/deletion][insertion]those of[/insertion]
gravitation & [deletion]the & agencies[/deletion][insertion]the mechanical ones[/insertion] [deletion]the agencies[/deletion]

[page]232||dnp14b228pp|92018501[/page]
[insertion]I first described[/insertion] are sufficient to account for the
[deletion]effects[/deletion] [insertion]results[/insertion] of time. But the physical
powers of nature in producing decay
are assisted likewise by certain
agencies or energies of organized beings
A polished surface of a building or
a statue, is no sooner made rough
from the causes that have been referred
to, than the seeds of lichens & mosses
which are constantly floating in
our atmosphere make it a place of [insertion]repose, grow & increase[/insertion]
[deletion]repose[/deletion]; [insertion]& from[/insertion] & their [insertion]death[/insertion] decay & decomposition
[deletion]gradually deposits[/deletion] carbonaceous matter
[insertion]is produced[/insertion] & at length [insertion]a[/insertion] [deletion]soiled[/deletion] [insertion]soil[/insertion] is formed in which
grass can fix its roots. [deletion]i[/deletion][insertion]I[/insertion]n the crevices
of walls where this soil is washed down

[page]233||dnp14b229pp|92018502[/page]
229
even the seeds of trees [deletion]can[/deletion] grow,
& gradually as a building becomes more
ruined, ivy & other parasitical plants
cover it. Even the animal creation
lends its aid to the work of
destruction, when man no [insertion]no[/insertion] longer labours
for the conservation of his works.
The fox burrows [insertion]burrows[/insertion] amongst ruins; bats
& birds nestle in the cavities in walls,
the snake & the lizard likewise
make [insertion]them[/insertion][deletion]here[/deletion] their habitation[insertion]s[/insertion]. Insects
act upon a smaller scale; but
by their united energies sometimes
produce greater effects. The ant
by establishing h[deletion]is[/deletion][insertion]er[/insertion] [insertion]colony[/insertion] & forming
h[deletion]is[/deletion][insertion]er[/insertion] magazine[insertion]s[/insertion] often saps the foundations

[page]234||dnp14b230pp|92018503[/page]
of the strongest building; & the
most insignificant insects triumph
as it were over the grandest works
of man. Add to these [unclear]sure[/unclear] &
slow operations, the devastations of
war, the effects of the destructive
zeal of bigotry, the predatory fang
of barbarians seeking for concealed
wealth under the foundations of
buildings, & [unclear]leaving[/unclear] from them every
metallic substance; & it is rather
to be wondered that any of the works
of the great nations of antiquity are
still in existence.
[deletion]P.[/deletion] [insertion][underline]Philolethes[/underline][/insertion] Your view of the causes of
devastation really is a melancholy

[page]235||dnp14b231pp|92018504[/page]

one; nor do I see any remedy.
The most important causes will
always operate; yet supposing the
constant existence of a highly civilized
people, the ravages of time might
be repaired; & by defending the
finest works of art from the
external atmosphere, [deletion]these[/deletion] [insertion]their[/insertion] changes
would be scarcely perceptible
[deletion]Pol.[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]The Unknown[/deletion] Eubathes[/insertion] I doubt much whether it is
for the interests of a people that
its public works should be of a
durable kind. One of the great causes
of the decay of the Roman Empire
was, that the people of the Republic
& of the first empire, left nothing

[page]236||dnp14b232pp|92018505[/page]
for their posterity to do. Aqueducts
Temples, Forums,- every thing was
supplied & there were no objects to
awaken activity, no necessity to
stimulate their inventive faculties,
& hardly any wants to call forth
their industry.
[deleton][underline]Philo[/underline][/deletion].[insertion][deletion]Philolethes[/deletion] The Unknown[/insertion] At least you must allow the
importance of preserving objects of the
fine arts. Almost every thing we have
worthy of admiration is owing to
what has been preserved from the
Greek school; & [deletion]these[/deletion][insertion]the[/insertion] nations who
have not had [insertion]possessed[/insertion] these works as models
have made [insertion]little or[/insertion] no progress [insertion]towards perfection[/insertion]: nor does it
seem that a mere imitation of
Nature is sufficient to produce

[page]237||dnp14b233pp|92018506[/page]
233
the beautiful or the perfect; but
[deletion]that[/deletion] the climate, the manners &
customs [insertion]the dress[/insertion] of the people, its genius
its taste all cooperate. Such
principles of conservation as [insertion]Philalethes[/insertion][[deletion][unclear]Poetius[/unclear][/deletion]
no works of excellence ought to
be exposed to the atmosphere; &
it is a great object to preserve
them in apartments of equable
temperature & extremely dry. The
roofs of magnificent buildings should
be of materials not likely to be
dissolved by water or [deletion]oxidated[/deletion][insertion]changed by air[/insertion].
Many electrical conductors should
be placed so as to prevent either

[page]238||dnp14b234pp|92018507[/page]
the slow or the rapid effects of
atmospheric electricity.
In painting lapis lazuli, or coloured
[deletion]hard[/deletion][insertion]hard[/insertion] glasses in which the oxides were
not liable to change should be used;
& the painting should be on marble
or [deletion]stucco set in[/deletion][insertion]or stucco encased in[/insertion] stone & no animal
or vegetable substances except pure
Carbonaceous matters should be used
either in the pigments or in the
varnishes.
[deletion][underline]Pol.[/underline][/deletion][insertion]Eubathes[/insertion] Yet when all is done that
can be done the work of conservation
is only producing a difference in the
degree of duration; & from the
statements that [unclear]Chemicus[/unclear][insertion]our friend[/insertion] has made

[page]239||dnp14b235pp|92018508[/page]
235
it is evident that none of the
works of a mortal being can
be eternal [insertion]as[/insertion] none of the combinations
of a limited intellect [insertion]can be[/insertion] infinite.
[deletion]Chemicus has shewn that[/deletion] the
operations of Nature when slow are
no less sure,[deletion]& that[/deletion] however man
may for a time usurp dominion
over her, she is sure of recovering
her empire. He converts her rocks
her stones, her trees, into the forms
of [insertion][deletion]Temples[/deletion]palaces[/insertion] houses & ships, He employs the
Metals found in the bosom of
the earth as instruments of
power, & the sands & clays which
constitute its surface as ornaments

[deletion]of his[/deletion][insertion]& instruments[/insertion] of luxury. He imprisons air
by water & tortures water by fire,
to change or modify or destroy the
natural forms of things; But in
Some lustres or olympiads his

few centuries they decay & are
destroyed: & his mighty temples
framed as it were for immortal
& divine purposes, & his bridges formed
of granite & ribbed with iron;
& his walls for defence & the

endeavoured to give eternity [insertion]even[/insertion] [deletion]even[/deletion]
to his perishing remains [deletion]& to his[/deletion]

generation of creature powers
of that which [underline]is living[/underline]
& which only spring from [insertion]life[/insertion]
[deletion]which was living[/deletion].-
I saw in all the powers

prepared[superscript]1[/superscript] to receive it [superscript]3[/superscript]

The - insensate seed,

The desire of glory of

be other than symtoms

Phil. From an observation
you just now made [deletion]I[/deletion]
[deletion]conclude[/deletion] that looking for
the functions of living things
[deletion]was[/deletion] in the properties of
inorganic matter was
seeking the living amongst
the dead, I conclude as
indeed I should from other
reflections I have heard
from your mouth, that
your views are altogether
hostile to materialism
or to those doctrines
in which thought is supposed
the result of the organization
of the body. Yet I have often

[page]289||dnp14b287pp|92018559[/page]
287

[page]290||dnp14b288pp|92018560[/page]
But the analogy is too
remote & incorrect. The [deletion]powers[/deletion][insertion]sources[/insertion]
of life cannot be grasped
by such machinery -[deletion]That[/deletion]
[deletion]which sees will not be[/deletion]
[deletion]visible that which touches[/deletion]
[deletion]will not be[/deletion] to look for them
in the power & agencies
of electrochemistry is
seeking the living amongst the
dead. That which touches
will not be felt: that
which sees will not be
visible that which
commands sensations
will not be their slave.

& the degrees of their temperature
are fitted to the circumstances
under which they live: & those
animals the life of which
is most active possess most
heat which may be [insertion]the[/insertion] result
of general actions & not
a particular effect of respiration
Besides a distinguished physiologist
has [deletion]shewn[/deletion] [insertion]rendered it probable[/insertion] that the  animal
animal heat depends more upon
the [deletion]funct[/deletion] functions of the nerves
than any upon any result
of respiration.
[deletion]Your a[/deletion] The argument
from the charge of colour
in perfectly delusive

[page]292||dnp14b290pp|92018562[/page]
Another argument in favour of
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Blacks opinion is the change
of colour [deletion]from black[/deletion] in blood
from black to red which seems
to shew that it loses [underline]carbon[/underline] -
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. With the
highest respect for the memory
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black & for the opinions
of his disciple, I shall answer
the arguments I have just heard
I will not allow any facts or
laws from the action of dead
matter to apply to living structures
The blood is a living fluid & of
this we are sure that it does
not[deletion]burn[/deletion] in respiration. -
The terms warm & cold
as applied to the blood of
animals are improper in
the sense in which they have
been just used. All animals
are in fact warm blooded

[page]293||dnp14b291pp|92018563[/page]
291
I could mention a thousand
instances from the combustion
of wood or spirits of wine
to the fermentation of fruit
or the putrefaction of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
animal matter. This general
fact which may be almost
called a Law is in favour
of the view of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black . -
Another circumstance in favour
of it is that those animals
which possess the highest temperature
consume the greatest quantity
of air : & under different
circumstances of action & repose
their heat is in great measure
proportional to the quantity
of oxygene consumed. Then
those animals which consume the
smallest quantities of air are
cold blooded. -

Bathes.
No one can be more
fully concerned than I am
of the very limited extent
of our knowledge in chemico
physiology & when I say
not having been a disciple
& friend of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black I am
still disposed to prefer
his ancient view to your
new one, I wish merely
to induce you to pause
& to hear my reasons, they
may appear insufficient to
you but I wish to explain
them. -
