In the system as it now exists the
powers of vegetation in decomposing
carbonic acid and those of animals
in forming it seem to be in equilibrio
and in countries where sea coal is
largely consumed as in England the
system of cultivation necessarily
raises a larger quantity of vegetable
food.
Nothing more curious than the manner
in which the productive and decomposing
powers are balanced in the Lago de
Solfatera. The travertine marble is
no sooner deposited from the water
by the destruction of the carbonic
acid which held it in solution
by vegetable life than it is discovered
by confervae, these confervae are de-
composed rapidly in the warm water
and they carry away with them the
marble which they were the means
of forming so that there is as it were
a constant struggle between life and
death.
