The spines of the upper dorsal fin
exceedingly hard & bony. The
stomach small and entirely sur=
-rounded by fat in larger quantity
than I ever saw in any other
fish & which at first I mistook for
melt & which explains the mistake
of Caviolini with respect to the
Spigula which is precisely a con-
-generous fish. One of the eyes
was milky, the other clear,
from which I think it probable
that blindness is a common disease
with these fishes, a peculiar defect
which is considered by Bloch as
a character. This fish had pro-
bably spawned or was too young
to be prepared for spawning and
The fishermen say the time of
spawning is in March -.
The Huco they say spawns here at
Christmas.
