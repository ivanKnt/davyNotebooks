22 To my old haunt
[insertion]Wurzen[/insertion]
Wurzen - Which is sublime
in the majesty of Alpine
grandeur, the snowy peaks
of the Noric Alps rising
above thunder clouds which
spring in all its bloom
& beauty is below. - Its
buds & blossoms adorning
the face of Nature under
a frowning canopy of dark
clouds.- - Like some
polite beauty of Italy
A Tranteverne brow &
eye & a mouth of
Venus and the [underline]Graces[/underline] -
