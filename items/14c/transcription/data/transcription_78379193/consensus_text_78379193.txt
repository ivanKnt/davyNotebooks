which runs out of the
Milstadtler See & caught
7 trout. 5 of them
not much under 3/4 of a
Pound.
Came after to Gmunden
where I slept.
28. - Obliged to wait for
[underline]post horses[/underline] in the morning. -
The char is made like a trout
but its habits are very different.
it lives in still waters & much
at the bottom, yet it has not
the compressed abdomen, & seems
though in cold waters not
infested by leeches, which seem
to adhere to fish in winter
this is probably because there
is no mud in the lakes that it
inhabit. The quails are now abundant
