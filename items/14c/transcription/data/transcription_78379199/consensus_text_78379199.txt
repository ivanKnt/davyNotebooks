Caught six trouts in excellent
season - Had one for dinner
which was redder and better
than a char.-
The fisherman says he has
seen a fish one out of 500
char which has the fins &
which he believes a cross
between the char & trout
Is it an ombre Chevalier?
He says except in colour
it is exactly like the char
& of the same size - Saw
a char this day which was
at least a pound -
Eel pout spawns in February
