11: - A fine day went to
the Traun and caught 16 fish
[deletion]6[/deletion] 8 graylings and I think expt
Trout. They took principally
a very small fly. There was
no large fly in & they
exhibited the same habits
as those fish I caught last
year; it was a cool
dark day. Thermometer at
my return 60 in window
Moist 55 pulse at a little
before 4 T 8 - 
The fish were in the still
pools by the sides of the
river, out of the rapid water
in places where they might not
be expected to be [deletion]worked[/deletion]
& where they could not be worked
