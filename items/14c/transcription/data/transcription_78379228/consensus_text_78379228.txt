invincible and eternal
Yet the absolute progress
[underline]instincts[/underline], [underline]wars[/underline] loves
is seen - 
profounder associations are
all of the same kind
but all tending to improvement
& the [deletion]only[/deletion] difference between
a field of battle now
& in the time of the
Assyrians, is that there
is more smoke in the
modern field & rather
[underline]less slaughter[/underline] -
He is then carried
through the heavens
where the system of
progression is of the
same kind.
