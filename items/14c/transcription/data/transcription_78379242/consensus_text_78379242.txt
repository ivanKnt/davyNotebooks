As it is in Alaric
marching legions of Savages
for some gross view of plunder
or ambition as an instrument
in divine hands for a
purpose which He is wholly
ignorant of - He is carrying
a strong race into [deletion]an[/deletion]
bitter country & giving strength
to a worn out population
& the deserts He makes will
become in another age [unclear]a less[/unclear]
field; & the solitude
He produces will be replaced
by [underline]a powerful[/underline] & healthy population
