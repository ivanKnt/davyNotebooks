in the primitive world proved
by the immense masses of [misc]misc_339|Pitcoal[/misc]
found in the secondary strata
which were for the most part
the results of vegetation, this seems
to show that the first atmosphere
contained a much larger proportion
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] and vegetable
life seems to have existed a pre-
-cessity before and animal and a di-
minution of the quantity of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] by the influence of the vegetable
kingdom probably prepared the
system for even the inferior races
of animated beings -
The rapidity with which [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
is decomposed is shown in the [place]place_849|lago[line]de Solfatera[/place] where [misc]misc_271|Coufervae[/misc] grow
rapidly in the water saturated with
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical], and their decomposition
is almost as quick as their growth
and their decomposition forms as it
were little floating islands of a
species of imperfect peat or coal
which are continually floating down
the stream issuing from this extra

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11403-000-00004|dnp14c02pp|78379150[/page]
-ordinary source.
In the system as it now exists the
powers of vegetation in decomposing
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] and those of animals
in forming it seem to be in equilibrio
and in countries where sea coal is
largely consumed as in [place]place_121|England[/place] the
system of cultivation necessarily
raises a larger quantity of vegetable
food.
Nothing more curious than the manner
in which the productive and decomposing
powers are balanced in the [place]place_849|Lago de[/place]
[place]place_849|Solfatera[/place]. The [misc]misc_105|travertine[/misc] marble is
no sooner deposited from the water
by the destruction of the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] which held it in solution
by vegetable life than it is discovered
by [misc]misc_271|confervae[/misc], these [misc]misc_271|confervae[/misc] are de-
composed rapidly in the warm water
and they carry away with them the
marble which they were the means
of forming so that there is as it were
a constant struggle between life and
death.

that was caught in the [place]place_251|Wernitz[/place] near its
junction with the [place]place_217|Danube[/place] the place
remarkable for two great victories
of [person]person_233|Marlborough[/person], [place]place_250|Schellenberg[/place] being a
hill just above the [place]place_251|Wernitz[/place] & the
field of [place]place_252|Blenheim[/place] being a little
on the other side of the upper
[place]place_217|Danube[/place]. The fish was in good season
& not unlike the best crimped cod
in taste. The spines and the fins
were as follows.

1. Dorsal 15. Teeth - 4 Inscisores

   Caudal 15 one on the lower

than I ever saw in any other

of [person]person_234|Caviolini[/person] with respect to the
[misc]misc_306|Spigula[/misc] which is precisely a con-
-generous fish. One of the eyes
was milky, the other clear,
from which I think it probable
that blindness is a common disease
with these fishes, a peculiar defect
which is considered by [person]person_235|Bloch[/person] as
a character. This fish had pro-

to be prepared for spawning and
