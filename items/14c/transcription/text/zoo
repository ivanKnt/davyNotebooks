The rapidity with which Carbonic acid
is decomposed is shown in the Lago
de Solfatera where Coufervae grow
rapidly in the water saturated with
Carbonic acid, and their decomposition
is almost as quick as their growth
and their decomposition forms as it

which are continually floating down

In the system as it now exists the
powers of vegetation in decomposing
carbonic acid and those of animals
in forming it seem to be in equilibrio
and in countries where sea coal is
largely consumed as in England the
system of cultivation necessarily
raises a larger quantity of vegetable
food.
Nothing more curious than the manner
in which the productive and decomposing
powers are balanced in the Lago de
Solfatera. The travertine marble is
no sooner deposited from the water
by the destruction of the carbonic
acid which held it in solution
by vegetable life than it is discovered
by confervae, these confervae are de-
composed rapidly in the warm water
and they carry away with them the

of forming so that there is as it were

was milky, the other clear,

that blindness is a common disease
with these fishes, a peculiar defect
which is considered by Bloch as
a character. This fish had pro-
bably spawned or was too young
to be prepared for spawning and
