how contrasted the darkness of
the scoria the ruins and the
desolation round the crater
with the scene below, there
we see the rich field covered
with flax or maize or millet
and intersected by rows of trees
which support the green and
graceful festoons of the vine;
the orange & lemon tree co-
-vered with golden fruit ap-
-pear in the sheltered glens,
the olive trees cover the lower
hills, islands purple in the
beams of the setting sun
are scattered over the sea
in the west & the sky is tinted
with red softening into the
brightest & purest azure;
the distant mountains still
retain a part of the snows
of winter but they are ra-
-pidly melting & they abso-
-lutely seem to melt reflecting
the beams of the setting
sun, glowing as if on fire:
and man appears emulous
