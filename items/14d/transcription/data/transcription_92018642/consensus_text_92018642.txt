is full of activity, the near-
-est part of the bay is covered
with boats, busy multitudes
crowd the strand, and at the
same time may be seen
a number of the arts be-
longing to civilised society
in operation, house building
ship building, rope making
the manipulations of the
smith & of the agriculturist
& not only the useful arts
but even the amusements
& luxuries of a great metro-
 -polis may be [deletion]seen[/deletion] [insertion]witnessed[/insertion] from the
spot on which we stand,
that motley crowd is collect

& those smaller groups [insertion]that surround[/insertion] [deletion]round[/deletion]
the stalls are employed in
enjoying the favourite food
& drink of the Lazaroni.
