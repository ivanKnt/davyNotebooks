most painful and oppressive but
when the weakness consequent to
the exhaustion came on, & when the
probability of death seemed to my
physicians greater than that of life

[underline]Philalethes[/underline]. No such thing I was pas-

object of my affection was a lady
with black hair dark eyes & pale
complexion: this spirit of my vision
on the contrary had brown hair,
blue eyes & a bright [insertion]rosy[/insertion] complexion,

=like any of the amatory forms
which in early youth had so
often haunted my imagination.
