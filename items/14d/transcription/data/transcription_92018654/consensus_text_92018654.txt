[underline]Ambrosio[/underline]. With such a tendency Phil-
-alethes as you have shown to believe
 in something like a supernatural,
or divine influence on the human
mind I am astonished that there should
be so much scepticism belonging to
your vision in the Colosaeum: [insertion]And[/insertion] & your
view of the early state of man,
after his first creation is not only
incompatible with revelation but
likewise with reason & of every thing
that we know respecting the history
or traditions of the early nations of
antiquity.
[underline]Philalethes[/underline]. Be more distinct and
detailed in your statements Ambrosio
that I may be able to reply to them.
