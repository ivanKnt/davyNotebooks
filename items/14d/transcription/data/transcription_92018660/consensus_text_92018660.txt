=menia in which Paradise is
supposed to have been placed
The early civilization of this
race could only have been in
consequence of their powers
and instincts having been of
a higher character than those
of  savages. They appear to have
been small families, a state not
at all fitted for the discovery
of arts by the exercise of the
mind & they professed the most 
sublime form of religion, the
worship of one supreme in-

a thousand years of civilization
was with difficulty attained
by the most powerful  effort
of reasoning by the greek sages
It appears to that in the
history of the jews nothing can
be more in conformity to our
ideas of [deletion]right reasoning and[/deletion]
just analogy than this series
of events. Our first parents
were created with every thing
