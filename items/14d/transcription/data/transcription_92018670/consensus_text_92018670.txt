have adopted are not un-
-common amongst young men
of very superior talents
who have only very slightly
examined the evidences of
revealed religion, but I am
glad to find that you have
not adopted the code of
 infidelity of many of the
 French revolutionists and of an
english school of sceptics
who find in the ancient as-
=tronomy all the germs of
the worship of the Hebrews
who identify the labours of
Hercules with those of the
Jewish heroes and who find
the life, death, & resurrec-
-tion of the Messiah in the
history of the solar day. You
at least allow the existence
of a primitive religious in-
-stinct or as you are pleased
to call it superstition
