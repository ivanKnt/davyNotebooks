the church to which
I belong and indeed
I may say the whole
christian church al-
-lowed visible images
pictures [deletion]& reli[/deletion] statues
& relics as the means
of awakening the
stronger devotional
feelings, We have
been accused of
worshipping merely
inanimate objects
but this is a very
false notion of
the nature of our
faith, we regard
them merely as vivid
characters [deletion]of spirit[/deletion]
