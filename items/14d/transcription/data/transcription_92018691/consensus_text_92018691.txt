There can be no doubt that
this belief has existed in the
human mind, & the belief
constitutes the vital part
of the religion. We know
nothing of the generation
of the human being in
the ordinary course of
nature how absurd then
to attempt to reason
upon the acts of the divine
mind, nor is there more
difficulty in imagining
the event of a divine
conception than of a
divine creation. To God
the Infinite little & great
as measured by human
powers are equal, a
creature of this earth
