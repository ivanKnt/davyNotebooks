as from sacred history
that man is a recent
animal on the globe
& that this globe has un-
=dergone one considerable
revolution since the
creation, by water & we
are taught that it is to
undergo another by fire
preparatory to a new
& glorified state of exis
-tence of man. but this
is all we are permitted
to know & as this state
is to be entirely different
from the present one
