orange grove in that
sheltered glen on which
the sun is now beginning
to shine & of which the
trees are at the same
time loaded with sweet
fruit & balmy flowers,
Such objects may well
portray a state in
which hope & fruition
become one eternal
feeling .
[underline]Onuphrio.[/underline] This glorious
sunrise seems to have
made you both poetical
tho' with the darkest &
most gloomy mind
