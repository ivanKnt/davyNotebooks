[underline]Dialogue the Second[/underline]
Scene: Vesuvius
and the [place]place_704|Bay of Naples[/place]
Subject. Discussions
connected with [insertion]the[/insertion] Vision
in the [underline][place]place_199|Colasaeum[/place].[/underline]
The same friends [person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person]
and [person]person_108|Onuphrio[/person] who were my
companions at [place]place_155|Rome[/place] in the 
winter accompanied me in
the spring to [place]place_156|Naples[/place]. Many
conversations occurred in the
course of our journey which
were often to me peculiarly
instructive and from the 
difference of their opinions
generally animated and often
entertaining.
I shall detail one of those
conversations which took
place in the evening on
the  summit of Vesuvius,
& [insertion]the remembrance of[/insertion] which from its connection
with my
vision in [place]place_199|[underline]the Colasaeum[/underline][/place]

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00006|dnp14d004pp|92018639[/page]
has always a peculiar in-
-terest for me.
We had reached with some
labour the edge of the crater
& were admiring the wonder-
-ful scene around us.
I shall give the conversation
in the words of the person-
-ages of the drama.
[person]person_102|Philalethes[/person]. It is difficult to
say whether there is more
of sublimity or beauty
in the scene before us.
Nature appears at once
smiling & frowning, in ac-
-tivity & in repose, how tre-
-mendous is the volcano,
how magnificent this great
laboratory of nature in its
unceasing fire, its subterra-
-neous lightnings & thunder,
its volumes of smoke,
its showers of stones and
its rivers of ignited lava;

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00007|dnp14d005pp|92018641[/page]

how contrasted the darkness of
the [misc]misc_791|Scoria[/misc] the ruins and the
desolation round the crater
with the scene below, there
we see the rich field covered
with flax or maize or millet
and intersected by rows of trees
which support the green and
graceful festoons of the vine;
the orange & lemon tree co-
-vered with golden fruit ap-
-pear in the sheltered glens,
the olive trees cover the lower
hills, islands purple in the
beams of the setting sun
are scattered over the sea
in the west & the sky is tinted
with red softening into the
brightest & purest azure;
the distant mountains still
retain a part of the snows
of winter but they are ra-
-pidly melting & they abso-
-lutely seem to melt reflecting
the beams of the setting
sun, glowing as if on fire:
and man appears emulous

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00008|dnp14d006pp|92018642[/page]
of nature for the city below
is full of activity, the near-
-est part of the bay is covered
with boats, busy multitudes
crowd the strand, and at the
same time may be seen
a number of the arts be-
longing to civilised society
in operation, house building
ship building, rope making
the manipulations of the
smith & of the agriculturist
& not only the useful arts
but even the amusements
& luxuries of a great metro-
 -polis may be [deletion]seen[/deletion] [insertion]witnessed[/insertion] from the
spot on which we stand,
that motley crowd is collect
-ed round policninello
& those smaller groups [insertion]that surround[/insertion] [deletion]round[/deletion]
the stalls are employed in
enjoying the favourite food
& drink of the Lazaroni.
[person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person] - We see not only
power and activity of man
as existing at present &

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00009|dnp14d007pp|92018643[/page]

of which the highest [deletion]pointer[/deletion] [insertion]example[/insertion]
may be represented by the
steam boat which is now de-
-parting for [place]place_1159|Palermo[/place], but we
may likewise view scenes
which carry us into the
very bosom of antiquity
& as it were, make us live
with the [deletion]dead[/deletion][insertion]generations of past ages[/insertion], those small
square buildings scarcely 
visible in the distance are
the tombs of distinguished
men amongst the early
greek colonists of the country
& those rows of houses
without roofs which ap-
-pear as if newly erecting
constitute a roman town
restored from its ashes that
remained for centuries as if
it had been swept from the 
face of the earth, when you
study it in detail you
you will hardly avoid the illusion
of believing that it is a rising
city: you will almost be 
tempted to ask where are
the workmen so perfect
square buildings scarcely

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00010|dnp14d008pp|92018644[/page]
are the walls of the houses
so bright and uninjured the
painting upon them hardly
anything is wanting to make
this scene a magnificent
epitome of all that is
most worthy of admiration
in nature & art, had these
been in addition to the other
objects a fine river & a
waterfall the epitome
would I think have been
absolutely perfect -
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person] - You are most
unreasonable in imagining
additions to a scene which
it is impossible to embrace
in one view & which pre-
sents so many objects to
the memory & to the ima-
gination yet there is a
river in the valley between
[place]place_156|Naples[/place] and Castel del Mare
you may see its silver
thread & the white foam
of its torrents in the

distance & if you [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]were[/insertion] geologists
you would find a number
of sources of interest which
have not been mentioned [insertion]in the scenery surrounding us[/insertion]
[place]place_1169|Somma[/place] [insertion]which is before is[/insertion] [deletion]the oposite mountain[/deletion]
for instance affords a won-
-derful example of a
mountain formed of marine
deposits & which has been
raised by subterraneous
fire & those large and
singular veins which you
see at the base & rising thro
the substance of the [deletion]moun-[/deletion]
[deletion]-tain[/deletion] [insertion]strata[/insertion]are composed of vol-
-canic porphyry & offer
a most striking and
beautiful example of
the generation and structure
of mountain[deletion]s[/deletion] & [insertion]chains & mineral veins[/insertion]
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. As we passed through [place]place_413|Portici[/place]
[deletion]on[/deletion] on [insertion]the[/insertion] road to the base of Vesuvius
it appeared to me that I saw a
stone from which had an ancient ro-
-man inscription upon it and
which occupied the place of a
portal in the modern palace
of the Bourbons.
 [person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person]. This is not an uncom-

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00012|dnp14d010pp|92018646[/page]
-mon circumstance most of
the stones used in the modern
[deletion]buildings[/deletion] [insertion]palaces[/insertion] of [place]place_413|Portici[/place] had been
employed & more than 2000 years
before in [deletion]buildings[/deletion] [insertion]structures[/insertion] raised by
the ancient romans or greek
colonists & is not a little
remakable that the buildings
of [place]place_714|Herculaneum[/place] a town covered
with ashes, tuffa, & lava from
the first recorded eruption of
Vesuvius more than 1700 years
ago should have been constructed
of volcanic materials produced
[deletion]in some an[/deletion] by some antecdent
igneous action of the mountain
in times beyong the reach of
history; & that men should
have gone on for so many
ages making erections in
spots where their works have
been so often destroyed in-
-attentive to the voice of
time of the warnings of nature.
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. This last fact recalls
to my recollection an idea
which Philathetes started in the
remarkable dream which

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00013|dnp14d011pp|92018647[/page]
11
he would have us believe occur
-red to him in the [place]place_199|Colosaeum[/place].
namely that no important fact
[deletion]to which[/deletion] can be useful to society
is ever lost and that [insertion]like these stones which[/insertion] tho covered
with ashes or hidden by ruins it is
sure to be brought forward again
and made use of in some new form
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. I do not see the [insertion]justness of the[/insertion] analogy
 to which [person]person_108|Onuphrio[/person] refers: but there
are many parts of that vision on
which I should wish to hear the
explanations of Philathetes. I con
-sider it in fact as a sort of poeti-
-cal epitome of his philosophical
opinions & [deletion]consider that[/deletion] [insertion]regard[/insertion] the vision
or dream as a mere web of [deletion]im[/deletion] his
imagination in which he intended
to catch us his summer flies and
travelling companions. -
[underline]Philathetes[/underline]. Here [person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person] you do
me wrong, I will acknowledge if you
please that the vision in the [place]place_199|Colosaeum[/place]
is a fiction but the most impor-
-tant parts of it really occured to
me in sleep particularly that in
which I seemed to leave the earth
& launch into the infinite of
space under the guidance of
a tutelary genius. And the origin
and progress of civil sociey

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00014|dnp14d012pp|92018648[/page]
form likewise parts of another
dream which I had many
years ago & it was in the rever
-rie which happened when you
quitted me in the [place]place_199|Colosaeum[/place]
that I wove all these thoughts
together & gave them the form
in which I narrated them to
you -
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio.[/underline][/person] Of course we may
consider them as an accurate
representation of your waking
thoughts.
[underline]Philathetes.[/underline] I do not say that
they strictly are so for I am not
quite convinced that dreams are
always representations of the
state of the mind modified by
organic diseases or by associa-
-tions. There are certainly no
absolutely new ideas produced
in sleep yet I have had more
than one instance in the course
of my life of most extraordinary
combinations [deletion]produced[/deletion] [insertion]occuring[/insertion] in this state
which have had considerable in-
-fluence on my feelings, my
form likewise parts of another

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00015|dnp14d013pp|92018649[/page]

imagination & my health.
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. Why [person]person_102|Philalethes[/person] you are be-
-coming a visionary a dreamer of
dreams we should perhaps set you
down by the side of [person]person_935|Jacob Behman[/person] [insertion]or Emmanuel Swedenbourg[/insertion] and
in another age you might have been
a prophet of have ranked even with
[person]person_114|Mahomet[/person]; but pray give us one of
those instances in which such a mar-
-vellous effect was produced on your
imagination or your health by a
dream, that we may form some
judgement of the nature of your
second sight or inspirations and
whether they have any foundation
or whether they are not as I believe
really [insertion]unfounded creations of the fancy, dreams respecting dreams[/insertion] [deletion]visionary[/deletion]
[underline]Philalelthes[/underline]. I anticipate unbelief
and I expose myself to your ridicule
in the statement I am about to make
yet I shall mention nothing but a
simple fact. Almost a quarter of
a century ago as you know I contrac-
-ted that terrible form of typhus fever
know by the name at jail fever, I
may say not from any unprudence
of my own but whilst engaged in put-
-ting in execution a plan for ventilating 
one of the great prisons of the metro-
polis, My illness was severe and

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00016|dnp14d014pp|92018650[/page]
dangerous, as long as the fever con-
 -tinued my dreams or deliriums were
most painful and oppressive but
when the weakness consequent to
the exhaustion came on, & when the
probability of death seemed to my
physicians greater than that of life
there was an entire change in all
my ideal combinations I remained in
an apparently senseless or lethargic
state but in fact my mind was pe-
-culiarly active, there was always
before me the form of a beautiful
woman with whom I was engaged in
the most interesting and intellectual
conversation.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. The figure of a lady with
whom you were in love.
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person]. No such thing I was pas-
-sionately in love at the time but the
object of my affection was a lady
with black hair dark eyes & pale
complexion: this spirit of my vision
on the contrary had brown hair,
blue eyes & a bright [insertion]rosy[/insertion] complexion,
& was as far as I can recollect un-
=like any of the amatory forms
which in early youth had so
often haunted my imagination.

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00017|dnp14d015pp|92018651[/page]
15
Her figure for many days was so dis-
tinct in my mind as to form almost
a visual image: as I gained strength
the visits of my good angel for so I
called it [insertion]&[/insertion] became less frequent &
when I was restored to health they
were alltogether discontinued. -
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. I see nothing very strange
in this a mere reaction of the mind
after severe pain & to a young man
of 25 there are few more pleasurable
images than that of a beautiful [deletion]and[/deletion]
[deletion]blooming[/deletion] maiden with blue eyes
blooming cheeks & long nut brown
tresses -
 [person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person]. But all my feelings and
all my conversations with this vision
-ary maiden were pure and of an
intellectual & refined nature.
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. Yes I suppose as long
as you were very weak.
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person]. I will not allow you to
treat me with ridicule upon this
point till you have heard the
second part of the story. [deletion]Nine[/deletion]
[deletion]Fifteen[/deletion] [insertion]15[/insertion] years after that recovery from
this fever and when I had almost lost
the recollections of the vision it was
recalled to my memory by a very
blooming and graceful maiden of

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00018|dnp14d016pp|92018652[/page]
[insertion]14 or 15 years old[/insertion] that I accidentally met during my
travels in Ilyria but I cannot say
that the impression made upon
 my mind by this female was very
strong and had nothing approach-
-ing to love for at that time I was
[deletion]deeply[/deletion] enamoured with a person
of a character and [misc]misc_284|Physiognomy[/misc]
entirely different. Now comes the
extraordinary part [insertion]of the narration[/insertion] [deletion]Ten[/deletion] 8 years after
24 years after my first illness at
a time when I was exceedingly
weak from a severe and dangerous
malady which for many weeks
threatened my life, and when my
mind was almost in a desponding
state being in a course of travels
ordered by my medical advisers
I again met the person who had
appeared as the representative
my visionary female and to her
kindness and care & to the hopes &
feelings created by the interest such
a person seemed to take in my
welfare I belive I owe [insertion]what remains to me[/insertion] [deletion]my[/deletion]
of life: my despondency gradually
disappeared and tho my health
still continued weak life began

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00019|dnp14d017pp|92018653[/page]

to possess charms for me which I
had thought were forever gone &
I could not help identifying this
living angel with the vision which
appeared as my guardian genius
during the illness of my youth.
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. I really see nothing at all
in this fact whether [deletion]the first or[/deletion] I
regard the first or the second part of
the story beyond the influence of
an imagination excited by disease.
From youth even to age women are
our guardian angels our comforters
& I dare say any other handsome young
female who had been your nurse
in your last illness would have coinci-
-ded with your rememberance of the
vision even tho her eyes had been
hazle & her hair flaxen. Nothing
can be more loose than the images
represented in dreams following a
fever & with the nervous susceptibility
produced by your last illness allmost
any agreable form would have become
the representative of your imaginary
guardian genius. Thus it is that by
the power of fancy material forms
are clothes in [deletion]divine[/deletion] [insertion]supernatural[/insertion] attributes

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00020|dnp14d018pp|92018654[/page]
and in the same manner imaginary
divinities [deletion]are clothed in supernatural[/deletion]
[deletion]attributes[/deletion] have all the forms of mor-
-tality bestowed upon them. The
Gods of the pagan mythology [deletion]are[/deletion]
were in all their [insertion]characters[/insertion] [deletion]forms[/deletion] and attributes
exalted human  beings. - The demon of
the coward & the angelic [insertion]form that appeared[/insertion] [deletion]shape that to[/deletion]
[insertion]in the dreams[/insertion] [deletion]the fear [unclear]xxx[/unclear] & dreaming eye [/deletion] of some
maid smitten by devotion & who having
lost her earthly lover fixes her thoughts
on heaven are clothed in the character
and vestments of humanity changed
by the dreaminess of passion -
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. With such a tendency Phil-
-alethes as you have shown to believe
 in something like a supernatural,
or divine influence on the human
mind I am astonished that there should
be so much scepticism belonging to
your vision in the [place]place_199|Colosaeum[/place]: [insertion]And[/insertion] & your
view of the early state of man,
after his first creation is not only
incompatible with revelation but
likewise with reason & of every thing
that we know respecting the history
or traditions of the early nations of
antiquity.
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person]. Be more distinct and
detailed in your statements [person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person]
that I may be able to reply to them.

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00021|dnp14d019pp|92018655[/page]
19
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. You make man in his early
or first created state as savage
like those that now inhabit [place]place_685|New-[line]Holland[/place] or [place]place_1160|New Zealand[/place] acquiring
by the little use that they make
of a feeble reason the power of
supporting & extending life, now I
contend that if man had been so
created he must inevitably have
been destroyed by the elements or de-
--voured by savage beasts who [deletion]were[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion]
so infinetely his superiors in physical
force, he must therefore have been
[deletion]created[/deletion] [insertion]formed[/insertion] with various instinctive
faculties & propensities with a per-
-fection of form and a use of organs
fitting him to become the master
of the earth: and it appears to me
that the account given in genesis
of the first parents of mankind
having been placed in a garden filled
with every thing necessary for their exis-
-tence & enjoyment & ordered to increase
& multiply there, is strictly in harmony
with reason & accordant with all
just metaphysical views of the na-
ture of the human mind. Man as
he now exists can only be raised with
great care & difficulty from the in-
-fant to the mature state, all his

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00022|dnp14d020pp|92018656[/page]
motions are at first automatic
and become voluntary by association
he has to learn every thing by slow
and difficult processes, many months
elapse before he is able to stand
& many years before he is able to
provide for the common wants
of life. Without mother or the
nurse [insertion]in his infant state[/insertion] he would die in a few hours
& without the laborious discipline
of instruction and example he would
remain idiotic & inferior to most
other animals. His reason is only
acquired gradually & when in its
highest perfection is often un-
-certain in its results; he must
therefore have been created with in-
-stincts that for a long while sup-
-plied the want of reason & which
enabled him from the first moments
of his existence to [deletion]supply[/deletion] [insertion]provide for[/insertion] his wants
to gratify his desires & enjoy the
power & the activity of life.
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person] I acknowledge that your
objection has some weight but not
so much as you would attribute
to it. I will suppose that the
first created man or men had
certain powers or instincts
such as now belong to the

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00023|dnp14d021pp|92018657[/page]
21
 rudest savages of the southern
hemisphere. I will suppose them
created with the use of their
organs for defence and offence
and with [deletion]instincts[/deletion] other passions
and propensities enabling them
to [deletion]provide for and gratify their[/deletion][insertion]supply their[/insertion]
common wants: & I oppose the
 fact of races who are now actu-
-ally in this state to your vague
historical or tradi[insertion]ti[/insertion]onary records,
& their gradual progress or im-
-provement from this early state
of society to that of the highest
state of civilization or refinement
may I think be easily deduced
from the exertions of reason assis
-sted by the influence of other
moral powers & of physical cir-
-cumstances. Accident I conceive
must have had some influence
in laying the foundation of certain
arts & a climate in which la-
-bour was not too oppressive and in
which the exertion of industry
was required to provide for the
wants of life must have fixed

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00024|dnp14d022pp|92018658[/page]
the character of [insertion]the[/insertion]activity of the early
improving people. Where nature
 is too kind a mother man is
generally a spoilt child, where
she is severe and a step mother
his powers are usually withered
 or destroyed. The people of the
South & the North and those be -
tween the tropics offer even at this
day proofs of the truth of this
principle, and it is even possible
now to find on the surface of the
earth all the different gradations
of the states of society from that
in which Man is scarcely removed
above the brute, to that in which
he appears approaching in his nature
to a divine intelligence. Besides
reason being the noblest gift of
God to man I can hardly sup-
-pose that an infinitely powerful
and all wise creator would bestow
 upon the early inhabitants of
the globe a greater proportion
of instinct than was at first
 necessary to preserve their exis -
tence, and that he would leave
his powers are usually withered

[insertion]their great progress[/insertion] of their improvement to the development
[deletion]and ex[/deletion][insertion]and exaltation[/insertion] of their reasoning powers.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. You appear to me in
your argument to have forgotten
the influence that any civilized
race must possess over savages
and many of the nations which you
consider as in their original state
may have descended from nations
who were [deletion]originally[/deletion][insertion]formerly[/insertion] civilized: and
it is quite as easy to trace the
retrograde  steps of a people as
their advances: the savage hordes
who now inhabit the [place]place_1162|northern coast[line]of Africa[/place] are probably descended
from the opulent, commercial
& ingenious Carthaginians who
 once contended with [place]place_155|Rome[/place] for the
empire of the world & even near-
-er home we might find in southern
 [place]place_097|Italy[/place] & her islands proofs of a
 degradation not much inferior. -
What I contend for is the civilization
of the first patriarchal races
who peopled the east and who
passed into Europe from Ar -

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00026|dnp14d024pp|92018660[/page]
=menia in which Paradise is
supposed to have been placed
The early civilization of this
race could only have been in
consequence of their powers
and instincts having been of
a higher character than those
of  savages. They appear to have
been small families, a state not
at all fitted for the discovery
of arts by the exercise of the
mind & they professed the most 
sublime form of religion, the
worship of one supreme in-
-telligence, a truth which after
a thousand years of civilization
was with difficulty attained
by the most powerful  effort
of reasoning by the greek sages
It appears to that in the
history of the jews nothing can
be more in conformity to our
ideas of [deletion]right reasoning and[/deletion]
just analogy than this series
of events. Our first parents
were created with every thing

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00027|dnp14d025pp|92018661[/page]
25
necessary for their wants and their
happiness; they had only one duty
to perform. By their obedience to
prove their love & devotion to
their creator; In this they failed
& death or the fear of death
became a curse upon their
race but the father of mankind
repented and his intstinctive or
intellectual powers gained by re-
-velation were transmitted to
his offspring more or less altered
or modified by their reason
which they had gained as the
fruit of their disobedience.
One [deletion]race[/deletion][insertion]branch of his offspring[/insertion], however in whom faith
shone forth above reason re-
-tained their peculiar powers
& institutions & preserved
the worship of [misc]misc_509|Jehovah[/misc]
pure, whilst many of the
races sprung from their bre-
-thren became idolatrous &
the light of heaven was lost
seen thro' the mist of the senses
& that Being worshipped by the

 of the nations who lived in the

which it was suspended before
the end of the Roman Empire,

 the triumph of Christianity over
Paganism in the time of [person]person_955|Constantine[/person]
can I think hardly fail to acknow

truth of revealed religion as
founded upon the early history
of man & whoever acknowledges
this reasonableness & this truth
 must I think be dissatisfied
with the view which [person]person_102|Philalethes[/person]
 or his Genius has given of the
Progress of society, & will find
in it one instance amongst
many others that might be dis
-covered of the vague & erring
results of his [insertion]so[/insertion] much boasted
 human reason.
[person]person_108|Onuphrio[/person], I fear I shall shock
[person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person], but I cannot help
vindicating a little the philo
sophical results of human
reason which it must be
allowed are entirely hostile
to his ideas. I agree with
[person]person_102|Philalethes[/person] that it is the

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00030|dnp14d028pp|92018664[/page]
noblest gift of God to man
and I cannot think that Am-
-brosios views of the paradisai-
-cal condition & the fall of
man and progress of society
is at all in conformity
with the ideas we ought
to form of the institutions
of an infinitely wise and
powerful Being; besides
[person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person] himself speaks
of the reasonableness of
his own opinions of course
his notions of reason
must be different from
mine or we [deletion]must[/deletion] [insertion]have[/insertion] adopted
different forms of logic
I do not find in the biblical
history any idea of the su-

-formable to those of the

greek philosophers; on the
contrary. I find [misc]misc_509|Jehovah[/misc]
 everywhere described as a
powerful material being
endowed with organs, powers
& passions similar to those
of a great and exalted human
being; he is described as making
man in his own image, as walk-
-ing in the garden in the cool
of the evening, as being pleased
with sacrificial offerings, as
angry with Adam and Eve,
as personally cursing [person]person_956|Cain[/person]
for his crime of fratricide,
and even as providing our first
parents with garments to
hide their nakedness then he
appears a [deletion]visible image[/deletion] [insertion]material form[/insertion]
in the midst of flames,
thunder & lightning [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[misc]misc_509|Jehovah[/misc]

and was regarded by the Levites
as having a fixed residence in
the ark; he is contrasted thro-
-ughout the whole of the Old
Testament [insertion]with the Gods of the Heathens[/insertion] only as being more
powerful, and in the strange
scene which took place at
Pharaoh's court he seemed to
have measured his [deletion]power[/deletion][insertion]abilities[/insertion] with
those of certain seers or ma-
-gicians & to have proved his
superiority only by producing
greater and more tremendous
plagues. In all the early
history of the jewish nation
there is no conception ap-
-proaching to the sublimity
of that of [person]person_605|Anaxagoras[/person] who
called God the Intelligence
 or vous. He appears always
on the contrary like the [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc]
of Arabian romance, living

=tains, urging his chosen
people to commit the most
attrocious crimes, to destroy
all the races not professing
the same worship, and to
exterminate even the child
and the [insertion]unborn[/insertion] infant; then I find
in the old Testament no
promise of a spiritual
[person]person_951|Messiah[/person] but only of a
temporal king, who as the
Jews beleive is yet to come.
The serpent in Genesis has
no connexion with the prin-
=ciple of Evil but is described
only as the most subtle
beast of the field, and having
injured man there was to
be a perpetual enmity
between these races, the
serpent when able was to
bite the heel of the Man,

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00034|dnp14d032pp|92018668[/page]
and the man when an op-
-portunity occurred was to
to bruise the head of the
serpent. I will allow if
you please that an in-
-stinct of religion, or super-
-stition belongs to the hu-
 man mind and that the
 different forms which
this instinct assumes
depend upon various cir-
cumstances and accidents
of history & climate; but
I am not sure that the
religion of the Jews was
 superior to that of the
Sabaeans who worshipped
the stars, or the ancient
[place]place_873|Persians[/place], who adored the
Sun as the visible symbol
of Divine Power, or the

and energies of the divinity.
I feel like the ancient
Romans with respect to
 toleration. I would give a
place to all the Gods
 in my Pantheon but I
 would not allow the
followers of [misc]misc_568|[deletion]Vishnu[/deletion][/misc] [insertion][misc]misc_577|Brama[/misc][/insertion] or of

[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person] You have mis-
- taken me [person]person_108|Onuphrio[/person] if you
think I am shocked by your
opinions, I have seen too much
of the wanderings of human

by them, & the views you

have adopted are not un-
-common amongst young men
of very superior talents
who have only very slightly
examined the evidences of
revealed religion, but I am
glad to find that you have
not adopted the code of
 infidelity of many of the
 French revolutionists and of an
english school of sceptics
who find in the ancient as-
=tronomy all the germs of
the worship of the Hebrews
who identify the labours of
[misc]misc_573|Hercules[/misc] with those of the
Jewish heroes and who find
the life, death, & resurrec-
-tion of [otherwork]otherwork_244|the Messiah[/otherwork] in the

at least allow the existence
of a primitive religious in-

to call it superstition

belonging to the human
mind and I have hopes that
upon this foundation you
will ultimately build up
a system of faith not un-
- worthy a philosopher &
a christian /_Man with
whatever religious instincts
he was created was intended
to communicate with the
visible universe by sensa-
-tions and to act upon it
by his organs, and in the
earliest state of society
he was more particularly
influenced by his gross senses
Allowing the existence of a su-
-preme intelligence [deletion]in[/deletion] and his
benificent intentions towards
man, the ideas of his presence
which he might think fit
to impress upon the mind
either for [insertion]the[/insertion] purpose of vene-
-ration or of love, of hope

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00038|dnp14d036pp|92018672[/page]
or fear, must have been in
harmony with the general
train of his sensations.
I am not sure that I make
myself intelligible. The
same indefinite Power
which in an instant
could create an universe
could of course so modify
the ideas of an intellectual
being and so give them
that form and character
most fitted for his existence
 & I suppose in the early
state of created man,
he imagined that he
enjoyed the actual
prescence of the divinity
or heard his voice;
I take this to be the first
& simplest result of
religious instinct. In early
times amongst the
patriarchs I suppose

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00039|dnp14d037pp|92018673[/page]
37
these ideas were so vivid
as to be confounded
with impressions, but
as religious instinct
probably became feeb-
-ler in [deletion]after ra[/deletion] their
posterity the vividness
of the impressions di-
-minished and they then
became visions or dreams
which with the prophets
seem to have constituted
inspiration. I do not
suppose that the supreme
Being [deletion]reall[/deletion] ever made
himself known to man
by a real change in the
order of nature but that
the sensations of men
were so modified by their
instincts as to induce
the belief [deletion]of[/deletion] in his prescence.
That there was a Divine

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00040|dnp14d038pp|92018674[/page]
Intelligence continually
acting upon the race
of Seth and his chosen
people is I think clear-
-ly proved by the events
of their history, and that
the early opinions of a
small tribe in [place]place_1186|Judaea[/place]
should have formed the
foundations of the religions
of the most active &
civilized and powerful
nations of the world

Paganism even when
professed and supported
by the powers and phi-
=losophy of Julian, the
martyrs who subs-cribed
to the truth of Christi-
-anity by shedding their
blood for the faith, the
exalted nature of those
intellectual men by whom
it has been professed who
had examined all the
depths of nature and
exercised the profoundest
faculties of thought such
as [person]person_036|Newton[/person], [person]person_078|Locke [/person]& [person]person_018|Hart-[line]=ley[/person], all appear to me
strong arguments in fa-
=vour of revealed religion,
I prefer rather founding
my creed upon the
fitness of its doctrines
than upon historical

evidences or the nature
of its miracles. The
divine Intelligence
chooses that men should
be convinced according
to the ordinary train
of their sensations, &
on all occasions it ap-
-pears to me more natu-
-ral that a change
should take place in
the human mind than
in the order of nature.
The popular opinion of
the people of [place]place_1186|Judaea[/place] was
that certain diseases
were occasioned by devils
taking possession of a

lieved to be cured by

the [misc]misc_523|Gospel[/misc] is expressed

[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. But you have
not answered my objections
with respect to the cruelty
exercised by the Jews, under

& which appear to me in
opposition to all [deletion]other[/deletion]
[insertion]our[/insertion] views of divine justice
& mercy.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. I think even 
[person]person_102|Philalethes[/person] will allow
that physical & moral
diseases are hereditary
& that to destroy a per-
=nicious unbelief or de-
-moniacal worship it was
necessary to destroy the
whole race root and
branch; as an example
with respect to [unclear]the earthly [/unclear]

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00044|dnp14d042pp|92018678[/page]
I will imagine a cer-

-ease which is trans-
-mitted by parents to
children & which like
the plague is commu-
-nicated to sound per-
-sons by contact, to
destroy a family of
men who would spread
this disease over the
face of the whole

Besides I believe in

change of existence
& supposing the new
existence a superior
one is a gain. To
the supreme Intelligence 
the death of a million
of human beings is
the mere circumstance
of so many spiritual
essences changing
their habitations &
is analogous to the
myriad millions of
larvae that leave
their coats [insertion]& shells[/insertion] behind them
& rise into the atmos-

man measures the

I can comprehend your

they might and I

When Christianity took

There can be no doubt that
this belief has existed in the

constitutes the vital part
of the religion. We know
nothing of the generation

to attempt to reason
upon the acts of the divine

difficulty in imagining
the event of a divine
conception than of a

even that he was the [person]person_951|Mes-[line]=siah[/person], therefore as far as
prophecy is concerned
there is no ground for
admitting the truth
of the religion of Mah-

the fashion with a
particular sect of
infidels to praise the

what a contrast does
this morality present
to that of the [misc]misc_523|Gospel[/misc]
which inculcates charity
to all mankind and
orders benevolent actions
to be performed even
to enemies: & the purity

state of the [misc]misc_335|Mahometans[/misc]
how gross are all the
ideas how unlike the
promises of a divine
& spiritual being: their
Paradise is a mere
earthly garden of
sensual pleasure &
their [misc]misc_524|Houris[/misc] represent
the ladies of their own
Harems rather than
[deletion]the[/deletion] glorified angelic
natures: How different

how sublime [insertion]in[/insertion] its idea,

[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person] I confess your
answer to my last argu-

one but I cannot
[deletion]make[/deletion] [insertion]allow[/insertion] a question of
such extent & of such
a variety of bearings
to be decided by so slight

gained by this answer
I will now offer another
difficulty to you: the
law of the Jews you
will allow was establish-
=ed by God himself, &
delivered to [person]person_115|Moses[/person]
from the seat of his
glory amongst storms,
thunder & lightning on
Mount Sinai. Why should
this law if pure & divine
have been overturned
by the same divine
Being who establish-
-ed it, & all the rites &

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00068|dnp14d066pp|92018702[/page]
ceremonies of the Hebrews
have been abolished by
 the first Christians; -
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person] - I deny that
the divine law of [person]person_115|Moses[/person]
was abolished by [person]person_951|Christ[/person]
who himself says "I
came, to confirm the
 law & not to destroy
it, and the ten command=

see a design not merely
connected with the[deletion]ir[/deletion] re-

with their political eco-

as a proof of their

kind of test of [deletion]faith[/deletion] [insertion] devotedness[/insertion] &
obedience to the theo-

 [person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person] I have been
 attentively listening to
 to your discussion. The
views which [person]person_108|Onuphrio[/person]
has taken of Christianity
certainly throw a light
over it perfectly new to
me & I must say in
candour that I am

[page]76|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00076|dnp14d074pp|92018710[/page]
disposed to adapt
his view of the early
state of society ra-
=ther than that of my
Genius, I have always
been accustomed to
consid[insertion]er[/insertion] religious fee-
=ling as instinctive
but [person]person_101|Ambrosios[/person] argu-
ments have given me
something approaching to
a definite faith for an
obscure and undefined no-
=tion. I am willingly to
allow that man was
created not a savage

75
 as he is represented in
my vision but perfect
in his faculties & with
a variety of instinctive
powers & knowledge:
that he transmitted these
powers & knowledge to
his offspring but that
by an improper use
of reason in di[deletion]s[/deletion]sobedience
 to the divine will the
instinctive faculties of
most of his descendants
 became deteriorated &
at last lost: but that
these faculties were
preserved in the race

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00078|dnp14d076pp|92018712[/page]
of [misc]misc_582|Abraham[/misc] & David
& the full power again
bestowed upon or recovered
by [person]person_951|Christ[/person]. I am ready
to allow the importance
of religion in cultivating
& improving the world,
& [person]person_101|Ambrosios[/person] view appears
to me capable of being
referred to a general law
of our nature, & revelation
may be regarded not as a
partial interference but as a
constant principle belong
-ing to the mind of man,
and the belief in super-

77
natural forms & agency,
the results of prophecies
& the miracles, as one
only of the necessary
results of it -
Man as a reasoning
animal must always
have doubted of his
 immortality & plan of
conduct, & in all the results
of faith there is immedi
=ate submission to a
divine Will which we
 are sure is good. We
may compare the destiny
of man in this particular
to that of [insertion]a[/insertion] migratory bird

[page]80|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00080|dnp14d078pp|92018714[/page]
If a slow flying bird as
 a Landrail in the
[place]place_940|Orkneys[/place] in Autumn
had reason & could use
it as to the probability
of his finding his way
over deserts, across seas,
& [insertion]of securing[/insertion] his food in passing to
a warm climate as
[place]place_222|Africa[/place] 3000 miles off
he would undoubtedly
starve in Europe. Under
the direction of his instinct
he securely arrives there in
good condition. I have

[page]81|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00081|dnp14d079pp|92018715[/page]
79
allowed the force of your
objections to that part
of my vision relating
to the origin of society
but I hope you will ad-
=mit that the conclusion
of it is not inconsistent
with the ideas derived
from revelation respec-
 ting the future state of
[insertion]the[/insertion] human [deletion]nature[/deletion][insertion]being[/insertion].
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person] Revelation
has not disclosed to us
the nature of this state,
but only fixed its certainty.
[deletion]for[/deletion] We are sure from
geological facts as well

[page]82|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00082|dnp14d080pp|92018716[/page]
as from sacred history
that man is a recent
animal on the globe
& that this globe has un-
=dergone one considerable
revolution since the
creation, by water & we
are taught that it is to
undergo another by fire
preparatory to a new
& glorified state of exis
-tence of man. but this
is all we are permitted
to know & as this state
is to be entirely different
from the present one

of misery & probation
any knowledge respecting
it would be useless and
indeed almost impossible
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person]. My Genius has
placed the more exalted
spiritual natures in
cometary worlds & this
last fiery revolution may
be produced by the appulse
of a comet.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. Human fancy
 may imagine a thousand
manners in which it may
be produced, but upon
such notions it is absurd
to dwell. I will not

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00084|dnp14d082pp|92018718[/page]
allow your Genius the
slightest approach to
inspiration, & I can admit
no verisimility in a reverie
which is fixed on a founda-
=tion you now allow to be
so weak - But see
the twilight is beginning
to appear in the orient
sky, & there are some
 dark clouds on the hori
=zon apposite to the crater
 of Vesuvius the lower edges
of which transmit a
bright light showing the
sun is already risen
on the country beneath

83
them. I would say that
they may serve as an
image of the hopes of im
- mortality derived from
revelation, For we are
sure from the light reflected
in those clouds that the
lands below are in the
brightest sunshine but we
are entirely ignorant of
its surface & scenery
so by revelation the light
of an imperishable &
glorious world is disclosed
to us, but it is in eternity
& its objects cannot be
seen by mortal eye, or

[page]86|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00086|dnp14d084pp|92018720[/page]
imaged by mortal imagin
ation.
[person]person_102|[underline]Philalethes[/underline][/person], I am not so
well read in the scriptures
as I hope I shall be
at no very distant time
but I think the pleasures
of heaven are mentioned
more distinctly than you
allow in the sacred
writings, I think I remem-
ber that the saints are
crowned with palms &
amaranths & that they
are described as perpetu -
ally hymning & praying
God -
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. This is evidently

[page]87|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00087|dnp14d085pp|92018721[/page]
85
only metaphorical. Music
is the sensual pleasure
which approaches nearest
to an intellectual one
& probably may represent
the delight resulting
from the perception
of the harmony of things
& of truth seen in God
The palm as an evergreen
tree of the amaranth is
a perdurable flower
are emblems of immorta
-lity. If I am allowed
to give a metaphorical
allusion to the future
state of the blest I
should image it by the

[page]88|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00088|dnp14d086pp|92018722[/page]
orange grove in that
sheltered glen on which
the sun is now beginning
to shine & of which the
trees are at the same
time loaded with sweet
fruit & balmy flowers,
Such objects may well
portray a state in
which hope & fruition
become one eternal
feeling .

of the party I cannot
help feeling its influence,
I cannot help believing
with you that the
night of death will
 be succeeded by a bright
morning, but as in the
scene below us the objects
are nearly the same as
they were last evening
with more of brightness &
brilliancy with a fairer
prospect in [insertion]the[/insertion] east & more
mist in the west so I
cannot help believing
that our new state of

an analogy to the pre-

order of events will
not be entirely different.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person] Your view is
not an unnatural one,
 but I am rejoiced to
find some symptoms
of a change in your
opinions. -
[person]person_108|[underline]Onuphrio[/underline][/person]. I wish with
all my heart they were
stronger. I begin to
feel my reason a

a very heavy load.

all the views you
have develloped, tho
I really wish to do so.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio.[/underline][/person] Your wish if
sincere I doubt not
will be gratified. Fix
your powerful mind
upon the harmony of
the moral world as
you have long been
accustomed to do upon
the order of the phys

[page]92|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00092|dnp14d090pp|92018726[/page]
you will see the scheme

itself alike in both.

[underline][person]person_108|Onuphrio[/person].[/underline] You again
perplex me; I cannot
believe that the adorations

the decrees of omnipotence.
[person]person_101|[underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/person]. You mistake me
As to their influencing
or affecting the supreme
mind it is out of the ques

your own mind, they
perpetuate a habit
of gratitude & of obe-

the affections & keep

ever passes from utter

he cannot at first
distinguish objects
better in one than

at last the habit not

but of receiving delight
as well as instruction
from it. In the pious

at [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]3[/insertion][superscript]3[/superscript] in the morning
for the purpose of visiting

we found ourselves at about

the hill at [place]place_1032|Eboli[/place] towards
the plain which contains
these stupendous monu

Were my existence to be
prolonged thro ten cen-
=turies I shall never
forget the pleasure
I received on that de

alighted from our car
=riage [insertion]to take some refreshment[/insertion] & reposed upon
 the herbage under the
shade of a mangnificent
pine [deletion]&[/deletion] contemplating
the view [insertion]around &[/insertion] below us. On
the right were the green
hills covered with pines
& olive trees stretching
towards [place]place_711|Sale[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]rno[/place]

beyond them were the

=mity of [place]place_704|The bay of [deletion]Na-[/deletion][line][deletion]=ples[/deletion] [/place][place]place_1202|[insertion]Sorento[/insertion][/place]; immediately below
our feet was a rich &
cultivated country filled
with vineyards & abounding
in villas in the gardens
of which were seen
the orange & the cypress

memoralize how near
to each other are life
& death, joy & sorrow

stretching beyond the

in the full luxuriance
of vernal vegetation.
In the extreme distance
as if in the midst of a

from the south west
it was literally a Zephyr
& its freshness & strength
in the middle of the day
were peculiarly balmy &
delightful; it seemed a
breath stolen from the
spring by the summer.
I never saw a deeper
or brighter azure
than that of the waves
which rolled towards
the shore & which was
rendered more striking
by the pure whiteness
of their foam. The

extraordinary scene
we descended to the
ruins & having taken
 at a farm house a
person who acted as
guide or Cicerone we
began to examine
those wonderful re

We had been watching

[deletion]the[/deletion] round the temples
in the sunshine when
our guide represented
to us the danger that
there was of suffering

malaria for which as
is well known this
place is notorious &
advised us to retire
into the interior of the
temple of the Neptune,
we followed his advice
& my companions [deletion]even[/deletion]
began to employ them
selves in measuring
the circumference
of one of the Ionic
columns when they
suddenly called my
attention  to a

[page]110|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00110|dnp14d108pp|92018745[/page]
stranger who was
sitting on a camp
stool behind it, The
appearance of any
person in this place
at this time was
sufficiently remarkable
but the man who
was before us from
his dress & appearance
would have been re
markable anywhere
He was employed in
writing [insertion]in[/insertion] a memorandum

book when we first
saw him, but he
immediately rose
& saluted us by bend-
=ing the head slightly
tho gracefully, & thus
enabled me to see
distinctly his person
& dress. He was
rather above the
middle stature,
slender but with well
turned limbs; his [deletion]face[/deletion]
countenance was re-
markably intelligent
his eyes hazle but
full & strong, his

unwrinkled & but for
some grey hairs which
appeared silvering his
brown & curly locks he
might have been sup-
posed to have hardly
reached the middle age,
his nose was acquiline

He took up his [insertion]hat[/insertion][deletion]stool[/deletion]
and appeared to be
retiring to another
part of the building
when I apologized
for the interruption
we had given to his
studies begged him
to resume them &
assured him that our
stay in the building
would be only momen
=tary for I saw that
there was a cloud
over the sun The

113
brightness of which was
the cause of our re-
=tiring. I spoke in Ita
=lian, he replied in En-
=glish observing that
he supposed the fear
of contracting the
malaria fever had
induced us to seek the
shelter of the shade
but [deletion]he said[/deletion] it is yet
too early in the season
to have much reason-
=able fear of this insidi-
-ous enemy; yet he added
this bottle which you
may have observed
here at my heart,

I carry about me as
a supposed preventive
of the effects of mias-
=mata & as far as my
experience has gone
it is effectual. I
ventured to ask him
what the bottle
might contain as
such a benefit ought
to be made known to
the world. He replied
It is a mixture which
slowly produces the substance
[deletion]known to the[/deletion][insertion]called by[/insertion] chemists
[deletion]by the name of[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_303|chlorine[/chemical]

now came forward &
bowing to the stranger
said he took the liberty
as he saw from his fam-
iliarity with the Cicerone
that he was well acquain
=ted with [place]place_180|Pestum[/place] of asking
him whether the masses

[page]119|MS-DAVY-11404-000-00119|dnp14d117pp|92018754[/page]
117
of [misc]misc_105|travertine[/misc] of which
the cyclopian walls & the
temples were formed were
really produced by aqueous
deposition from the ri-
-ver [place]place_1203|Silaro[/place] as he had
often heard reported.
The stranger replied [deletion]that[/deletion]
they were certainly pro-
[underline]duced by[/underline] deposition from
water & such deposits
are made by the [place]place_1203|Silaro[/place]
but I rather believe [insertion]he said[/insertion]
that a lake in the im-
mediate neighbourhood

these stones were exca

if you like after you
have finished your ex-
=aminations of the temples
with your guide I will
accompany you to the
spot from which it is
evident that [deletion]the[/deletion] large
masses of the [misc]misc_105|travertine[/misc]
[chemical]chemical_363|Marmor Tiburtinum[/chemical] or
[chemical]chemical_148|calcareous tuffa[/chemical] have
been raised. We thanked
him for his attention

round the temples and
returned to our new ac-
quaintance who led
the way thro' the gate of
the city to the banks
of a pool or lake a
short distance off.
We walked to the borders
on a mass of calcareous
Tuffa & we saw that
this substance had even
encrusted the reeds on
the shore. There was
something peculiarly
melancholy in the

their thirst in it which
ran wildly away on

appeared to retire
into a rocky excava-

said the stranger, is
what I believe to be
the source of those
large & durable stones

this water rapidly
deposits calcareous

throw a stick into it
a few hours is suf-

and in that large ex -
cavation where you
saw the buffalos
dissappear you may
observe that immense

of art in remote times
The marble that remains
in the quarry is of the
same texture and
character as that
which you see in

ly possible to doubt
that the builders of
those extraordinary
structures derived a
part of their mater-
 ials from this very
spot. [person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person] gave
his assent to this
opinion of the stran-
=ger & I took the
liberty of asking him
as to the quantity
of the calcareous
matter contained
in solution in the

appeared to me that
for [insertion]so[/insertion] rapid & consider-
able effect [insertion]of deposition[/insertion] there
must be an unusual
quantity of solid
matter dissolved by
the water or some
peculiar circumstan
=ces of solution. The
stranger replied This
water is like many
I may say most of
the Sources which rise
at the foot of the Appen

ines, it holds [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] in solution which
has dissolved a portion
of the calcareous
matter of the rock
thro which it has
passed: this [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] is dissipated
in the atmosphere
& the marble slowly
thrown down assumes
a crystalline form
& produces coherent
stones. The lake be-
fore us is not par-

ticularly rich in the
quantity of calca-
reous matter that
it contains for as
I have found by ex-
=periment a pint of
it does not afford
more than 5 or 6 grains
but the quantity of
the fluid & the length
of time are sufficient
to account for the
immense quantities
of Tuffa & rock

of ages have accu-

situation [person]person_108|Onuphiros[/person]
curiosity was excited
by this statement
of the stranger and
he said may I take
the liberty of asking
[deletion]you[/deletion] if you have any
idea as to the cause
of the large quantity
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] which
[deletion]as[/deletion] you have been so

replied I certainly
have formed an opi

which I willingly
state to you. It
can I think scarcely
be doubted that [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
[insertion]there is[/insertion] a source of volcanic
