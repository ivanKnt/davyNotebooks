[underline]Dialogue the Second[underline]
Scene: Vesuvius
and the Bay of Naples
Subject. Discussions
connected with [insertion]the[/insertion] Vision
in the [underline]Colasaeum.[/underline]
The same friends Ambrosio
and Onuphrio who were my
companions at Rome in the 
winter accompanied me in
the spring to Naples. Many
conversations occurred in the
course of our journey which
were often to me peculiarly
instructive and from the 
difference of their opinions
generally animated and often
entertaining.
I shall detail one of those
conversations which took
place in the evening on
the  summit of Vesuvius,
& [insertion]the remembrance of[/insertion] which from its connection
with my
vision in [underline]the Colasaeum[/underline]

has always a peculiar in-
-terest for me.
We had reached with some
labour the edge of the crater
& were admiring the wonder-
-ful scene around us.
I shall give the conversation
in the words of the person-
-ages of the drama.
Philalethes. It is difficult to
say whether there is more
of sublimity or beauty
in the scene before us.
Nature appears at once
smiling & frowning, in ac-
-tivity & in repose, how tre-
-mendous is the volcano,
how magnificent this great
laboratory of nature in its
unceasing fire, its subterra-
-neous lightnings & thunder,
its volumes of smoke,
its showers of stones and
its rivers of ignited lava;

how contrasted the darkness of
the scoria the ruins and the
desolation round the crater
with the scene below, there
we see the rich field covered
with flax or maize or millet
and intersected by rows of trees
which support the green and
graceful festoons of the vine;
the orange & lemon tree co-
-vered with golden fruit ap-
-pear in the sheltered glens,
the olive trees cover the lower
hills, islands purple in the
beams of the setting sun
are scattered over the sea
in the west & the sky is tinted
with red softening into the
brightest & purest azure;
the distant mountains still
retain a part of the snows
of winter but they are ra-
-pidly melting & they abso-
-lutely seem to melt reflecting
the beams of the setting
sun, glowing as if on fire:
and man appears emulous

of nature for the city below
is full of activity, the near-
-est part of the bay is covered
with boats, busy multitudes
crowd the strand, and at the
same time may be seen
a number of the arts be-
longing to civilised society
in operation, house building
ship building, rope making
the manipulations of the
smith & of the agriculturist
& not only the useful arts
but even the amusements
& luxuries of a great metro-
 -polis may be [deletion]seen[/deletion] [insertion]witnessed[/insertion] from the
spot on which we stand,
that motley crowd is collect
-ed round policninello
& those smaller groups [insertion]that surround[/insertion] [deletion]round[/deletion]
the stalls are employed in
enjoying the favourite food
& drink of the Lazaroni.
Ambrosio - We see not only
power and activity of man
as existing at present &

of which the highest [deletion]pointer[/deletion] [insertion]example[/insertion]
may be represented by the
steam boat which is now de-
-parting for Palermo, but we
may likewise view scenes
which carry us into the
very bosom of antiquity
& as it were, make us live
with the [deletion]dead[/deletion][insertion]generations of past ages[/insertion], those small
square buildings scarcely 
visible in the distance are
the tombs of distinguished
men amongst the early
greek colonists of the country
& those rows of houses
without roofs which ap-
-pear as if newly erecting
constitute a roman town
restored from its ashes that
remained for centuries as if
it had been swept from the 
face of the earth, when you
study it in detail you
you will hardly avoid the illusion
of believing that it is a rising
city: you will almost be 
tempted to ask where are
the workmen so perfect
square buildings scarcely
