I could no longer bear the scorching rays
And when I looked again they were

not seen -

but in the brightness of the solar

blaze
Their memory left a type & a desire

[deletion]So should I desire[/deletion]

[insertion]So should I wish towards the[/insertion]

[deletion]Towards the immortal[/deletion] course of
light to rise.
Intending younger spirits to aspire

Where I could never reach amidst 

the skies
And joy [insertion]below[/insertion] to see them lifted higher

Seeking the light of purest glorys

prize -

[deletion]So would I look on light[/deletion][deletion]
[/deletion][deletion]what [unclear]x[/unclear]y dazzled[/deletion]

[deletion]to soar in [unclear]xx[/unclear] steadiness[/deletion]

So would I look on splendorous
brightest day
