To a Child; daughter of T.
and AB.
Sweet blossom of the early spring of life
Thy opening lineaments in the hope I view
And as I think on thy maturer age
I form a fairy dream and wish it true
I see thou cheeks now pale[deletion]d[/deletion] as are the clouds 

Which in the watered vale in Morning lie
Kindling with the rosy hues of happy [insertion]health[/insertion]
And glowing like the autumnal evening [insertion]sky[/insertion]
I see that hair [insertion]locks[/insertion] which now has [insertion]have[/insertion] scarcely reached
Thy foreheads smoothness & thy neck of snow
In darkest hues of beauty's contrast clad
In graceful ringlets down thy shoulders [insertion]flow[/insertion]
I see those eyes which now impassive gaze
Are filled with softness and unchanging light
Kindling with holy feelings, brilliant rays
And in expressions, liquid lightnings [insertion]bright[/insertion]

I hear the accents which thy infant [insertion]voice[/insertion]
