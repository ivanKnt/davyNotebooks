On the four Eagles 2 young & 2 old
Nature was richly clad in summer

dress
The heavens & earth were filled with 

loveliness

Bright was the azure of the sky above
The aerial minstrels warbled songs 

â€“ of love
I was soujourning on this lovely day

On the high hills where Luicharts 

waters spring

When far above the cataracts foaming spray
I saw four [underline]Eagles[/underline] soaring on the wing
Two were above the parents & the 

guides

Of the young aery that towards them rose

time

To that high temple where amidst

the stone

Ye made to breathe, ye stand alone
