Such as a Seraph spirit might ken;
Gave thee thy immortality,
And placed thee midst undying men.
Canova.
Thou wert a light of brightness in an age

When Italy was in the night of art
She was thy country; but the world 

thy stage
On which thou acted thy creative part
Blameless thy life. Thy manners playful 

mild

Master in Art yet Natures simplest

child.
Phidias of Rome like him thou 

stand sublime

And after artists shall essay to climb
[deletion]To that high temple [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] by [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]To that high temple where ye stand alone[/insertion]
Generous to all but most to serving 

Merit

By noble praise awakening the spirit
Yet all unconscious of the eternal flame

And light of glory circling round your name.
