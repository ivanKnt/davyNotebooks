Though grey thy hair, thine eye is bright
As in thy freshest youthful days:
It flashes intellectual light.
Thy mouth with smiles expresive plays,
Expressive of the cheery heart
Gentle, though strong; and warm though mild;
Smiles unconstrained and free from art,
Like those of the untutored child,
When after absence long he hears
His mothers voice, Smooth is thy brow
Unstained by passion or by cares.
Thy voice is full and sweet, tho' low
And chastened [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]Such[/insertion] its varied powers:
It haunts me in my very dreams,
In cities as in rural bowers;
Bringing back echoes of these themes
Where reason strong, and [unclear]xxx[/unclear]ing high
