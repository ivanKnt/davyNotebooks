Oh, let the breeze

[Horizontal rule]
Oh, let the breezes play upon my brow
Upon some wood clad hill
And let a gentle stream beneath me flow
A gently murmuring rill.
[Horizontal rule]
There let me feel with new born pleasure
The most exalted human pleasure;
Let health my feeble body bless
Health in all her loveliness!
[Horizontal rule]

There let recovery come
To fix my doubtful doom;
And let me, like the sportive boy
Feel life an everflowing well of Joy!

[Horizontal rule]
Written at the end of a fever which lasted
40 days
