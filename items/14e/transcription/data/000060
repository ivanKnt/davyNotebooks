Like the mild Zephyr of the full born [insertion]spring[/insertion]
Succeeding to the frosty northern blasts
She felt that nature had designed her [insertion]to perform[/insertion]
All soft and tender duties; to become
A Wife, a Mother: that her heart was [insertion]formed[/insertion]
Not for the dull inert and callous round
Of [deletion]earthly[/deletion] [insertion]courtly forms and[/insertion] ceremonies; but soft & filled
With [deletion]spirit[/deletion] [insertion]power[/insertion] and with passion to become
All natural sympathies; to interweave
Itself with other hearts; to glow with [insertion]rapture[/insertion]
At anothers joys; to melt in sorrows
At anothers woes: This was its Spring [insertion]time[/insertion]

After its winter frost;
A helpless innocent condemned to die
Gently flowed on the water as
The sun shone on them in full brightness
