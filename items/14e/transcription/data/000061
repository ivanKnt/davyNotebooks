Moisten[deletion]ing[/deletion] the lips of a dear [insertion]dying suffering[/insertion] infant,
There are aged man. One shout were
In adoration, all bent down & worshipped
Unawed with eyes upraised to heaven
And a living mind feeling the harmony
Of forms, the Prophet stedfast set
When murmuring as of the distant fall of [insertion]water[/insertion]
Came fall on his ear, and as the breezes [insertion]changed[/insertion]
[deletion]Changed[/deletion], now louder rose, now faintly [insertion]died away[/insertion]
More rapid rolled the stream impelled [insertion]in foam[/insertion]
Our rocky fragments, on the current still
The bank moved quickly on
O with what pleasure, with what strong [insertion]delight[/insertion]
Does nature long sub[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]dued, imprisoned long
By heavy custom and the cumbrous charm
Of earthly ceremony, assume his rights
