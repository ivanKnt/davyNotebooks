Sounds [insertion]of sadness[/insertion] and murmurings of deep contempt
Against their leader [insertion]Rose[/insertion], Where is the Lord
[deletion]Jehovah[/deletion] [insertion]]Where is[/insertion], the God of Israel, [insertion]they said[/insertion] Job
And have we left the fertile plains
And the eternal waters of the Nile
To die in agony, parched a nation lost
The shepherd spoke not, moved but in
The coldness of prayer in secret groaned, [insertion]long[/insertion]
Did he look toward heaven with sadness
When on a sudden brightened up his eye
With exhultation, [deletion]and in[/deletion] [insertion]& His[/insertion] loftiest tone
Filled each heart with hope & joy
"The Lord shall save," he cried.
O, who can paint the scene of joy
Of tumult and of hurried hope
Here was a Mother seen, to plunge her hand
Into the stream and from the moistened palm
