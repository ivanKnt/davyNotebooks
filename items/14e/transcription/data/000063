His temple is the Heavens whence His life
Flows into nature and is felt and seen
In sunbeams and in Cloud, and in the balm
Of evening breezes, and reviving dew
That clothes the earth [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] verdure. [insertion]He dwells not[/insertion]
Obscurely but [insertion]is[/insertion] through Universal being [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]visible[/insertion]
Each fleeting cloud the offspring of the [insertion][deletion]blast breeze[/deletion] breeze[/insertion]
Chilled by the bosom of the mountain chain

[Horizontal rule]

Fixed every eye. All looked with wistfulness 
Upon the unbroken surface of the sky
Its heavenly blueness made them sick at [insertion]heart[/insertion]
Each lip was parched the eye was dry & red
The tawny cheek burnt with unwholesome [insertion]fire[/insertion]
And slow and languidly their unwilling limbs

Performed their irksome functions [deletion]of sadness[/deletion]
