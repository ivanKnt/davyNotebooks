65

An attempt by the Priests
to imitate Moses.
High was the dome built of that mighty [insertion]rock[/insertion]
Over which the nile a foaming torrent pours
In Mountain Egypt. Carved on the wall
The symbols and the sensible imagery
Of Nature, and the natural forms of things 
Rose fresh as newly from the gravers hand
Though wrought in ages part
Ground in order regular [deletion]ar[/deletion]rayed & pomp
Or ornament, the embalmed bodies stood
Of those, the chiefs and nobles of the land
Who in the age of Shepherd kings had lived
Feeding their flock beneath the Palm tree [insertion]shade[/insertion]
Dwelling in tents, a family of love;
Breathing soft music o[deletion]f[/deletion][insertion]n[/insertion] the pastoral [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
Of those, a bolder race in after time
The conquerors of the east - those who went [insertion]forth[/insertion]

When the bold sceptered Hero led his hosts
