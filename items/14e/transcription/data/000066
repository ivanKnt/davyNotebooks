The Camel with dry nostrils
He stood alone, the shepherd; Over him [insertion]moved[/insertion]
The Simoom in its strength: He felt the [insertion]flush[/insertion]
As of a fever fit, but quick it passed,
And then he knew his life preserved, and [insertion]sacred[/insertion]
To [insertion]an[/insertion] Almighty purpose[deletion]s[/deletion] - to a glorious Ministry.
And, I have dwelt amidst the naked rocks
Beside the waste where no stream murmured
[deletion]And[/deletion] where no sounds [deletion]are heard[/deletion] [insertion]were heard[/insertion] save of the [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]blast[/insertion]

That with its sandy burthen wildly roared 

[deletion]are heard[/deletion][deletion]
