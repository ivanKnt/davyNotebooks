Of Nature in her noblest mountain garb

Came new upon his spirit.

[deletion]And[/deletion] [insertion]On[/insertion] the wild rock and on the palm[deletion]s[/deletion] cloathed [insertion]hill[/insertion]

[deletion]Even[/deletion] [insertion]And[/insertion] in the snowy mountain, pleasure [insertion]seemed[/insertion]

To fix her dwelling place; and music for [insertion]him moved[/insertion]

[insertion]for him in every torrent murmuring sound[/insertion]

And balmy sweetness dwelt in every [deletion]dell[/deletion] 

[insertion]breeze[/insertion]

And every sunbeam ministered to life

And he had wandered in the desart [insertion]skirts[/insertion]

Watching the median flocks that far had [insertion]strayed[/insertion]

Basking amidst the sunshine of the waste

When in the north, a dim and feeble light

Of purple hue appeared and onward moved

As if a blast of fire. Before it sunk

Each living thing: The bounding antelope

Whose swiftness rivals even the arabs shaft

Is prostrate trembling on the burning sod
