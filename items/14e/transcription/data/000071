And he had wandered by the pleasant side
Of silver Jordan, here a mountain stream,
A murmurer wild amidst the broken rocks,
Of ancient Horeb and the Cedars shade
Of Antilebanon, Matching the strange tints
That played upon the waters; in the sky
Tracing the fleecy clouds, that seemed to move
From heaven to earth, - now on the mountains [insertion]top[/insertion]
Resting on Canopy of purple light;
Now through the valley floating as a sea
Of undulating mist. Glad was his mind:
The loftiness of joy upraised his heart:
In nature and her mighty forms he saw
The plenitude of wisdom, and he felt this power
That moves invisible in energy,
At once the soul of each and life of all.
And soon his thoughts
Turned backward to his people, to the oppressed
The servants of the Living One, - the race [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

Of promise, the selected of from mankind;
