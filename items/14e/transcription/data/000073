To reach the earth. The eternal being
Preserve one glorious wise design;
Order amidst confusion flows
And all the system is divine
If [underline]matter[/underline] cannot be destroyed,
The [underline]living mind[/underline] can [underline]never die[/underline]:
If een creative when alloyed,
How sure its immortality.
Then think that intellectual light

Thou lovedsâ€™t on earth is burning still:
Its lustre purer and more bright,
Obscured no more by mortal will.

-
The things most glorious on the earth
Though transient & short lived they seem;
Have yet a source of heavenly birth
Immortal: not a fleeting dream.
