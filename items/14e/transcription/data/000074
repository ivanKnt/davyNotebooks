The massy pillars of the earth,
The inert rocks, the solid stones, 
Which give no power no motion birth,
Which are to Nature lifeless bones;

-
Change slowly; but this dust remains
And every atom measured, weighed,
Is whirled by blasts along the plains
Or in the fertile furrow laid.

-
The drops that from the transient shower
Fall in the noon-day, bright and clear
Or kindle beauty in the flower,
Or waken freshness in the air;

-
Nothing is lost. The ethereal fire
Which from the furthest star descends
Through the immensity of space, 
Its course, by worlds attraction bends.
