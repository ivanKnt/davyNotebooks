Reposing his gray silvery hairs 

If Upon a damsels knee who was

herself placing her bright locks

On a matrons lap had with 

fingers

Red [unclear]xx[/unclear] searched through her 

auburn locks

All seeking there [unclear]small cursed mites[/unclear]

That breed in happy heads.

Yet deem not this as idle occupation

Or low or mean.

For spirits are framed diversely 

some to scan

The vault of heaven & weigh the 

golden stars

Measure their distances & trace the laws

Which to Creationâ€™s wonders infinite,

Give the pure harmony of one design.

Others to wield the terrible machinery

Of War; And midst the shrieks of wounded 

men.
