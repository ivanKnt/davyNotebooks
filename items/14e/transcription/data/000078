In that fair clime where spring & 

summer reign
Alternate When the Carabus bright 

green

And the myrtles pleasant shade
And the golden fruit of the Hesperion

tree
Give to the plain a richness & 

a warmth

Which seems to mock the mountains 

poverty
And cloak of snow. Oft have I seen

Reposing on the rocks which fringe

the bright shores

Of that sapphire sea [unclear]without[/unclear] a tide

A multitude of [underline][unclear]grasses[/unclear][/underline] composed of
withered nature - of blooming [unclear]reed[/unclear]

And sporting children, springing from the water
Naked & wet [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] with sea foam from which
it seemed as if they spring [unclear]And have[/unclear]

[unclear]x xxx[/unclear]
