Since first the sense of beauty thrilled my nerves
Yet still my heart is sensible to thee,
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]As[/insertion] when it first received the flood of life
In youths full spring-tide: and to me it seems
As if thou wert a Sister of my soul;
An animated being - carrying on
An intercourse of high and lofty thoughts,
Awaking the slumbering powers of inspiration
In those [insertion]most[/insertion] secret founts of high poetic feeling
[underline]A paragraph[/underline] in the book on

angling. Rainbows & omens.

& here "the coldest time' of the 24.
