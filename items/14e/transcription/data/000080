Augt 19.

Thou loveliest form of the celestial world
When in the circle of thy brightness
Thou sheddest in the blue unclouded sky
All thy meridian lustre in the North
Above the heath clad mountains have I [insertion]seen[/insertion]
Thy clear and mellow light; & when the waves
Of the atlantic raised their foaming surge
Against the eternal rocks, where fabled sleeps
The last of the Western Titans;- there when young
In mind and light of heart, thy rays had all [insertion]the power[/insertion]
To solemnize and tune to thoughts sublime,
My vagrant spirit. And now in these fair [insertion]climes[/insertion]
Where in a purer and more balmy air,
And in a sky where tints of ether seem
Giving a saint-like glory to thy rays,
Thy influence is strong in a heart 
Wearied, but not yet broken or subdued.
Though many chequered years have passed [insertion]away[/insertion]
