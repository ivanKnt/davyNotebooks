I catch but dimly inspirations faint 
Of that eternal power. They come to me
Like flashes of a light uncertain, imaging
But for an instant mighty forms, with gleam
Too transient to mark their nature or their [insertion]character;[/insertion] 
Yet something of a certain destiny awakes my [insertion]spirit.[/insertion]
Thus the traveller benighted midst the mountains

When the thunder storm is rife
By the blue lightnings momentary blaze
Catches the awful forms which round [insertion]him rise[/insertion]
But knows not whether they be battlements
Of Alpine castle, or a ridge of rocks

Or village towering midst the pines:
And moulds them as his fancy best may [insertion]chuse[/insertion]
To suit its preconception.
If warm with hope, the anxious traveller [insertion]sees[/insertion]
In the fire that blazes on the mountains [insertion]height[/insertion]
The shepherds watch light. If chilled with fear
