Thus in the mind

Rises a new born energy

Thoughts that were dead are raised

The power [unclear]xxx[/unclear] wakes again

And all the store & fortress

& impurity

Are buried in the ocean deep & still

of reason

and saw creation dance[insertion]danse[/insertion] upon its waves[insertion]waves[/insertion]

E'en as they purify, a thousands forms[insertion]forms[/insertion]

of Beauty & of grace.

The intellectual soil freshened[insertion]freshened[/insertion] by dews

Enriched from the leaves is green

with life

Green are the fertile crops.
