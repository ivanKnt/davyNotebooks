The tempest gathered on thy verdant hills
O Lusignano. [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] the azure of the southern 

sky.
Was dimmed by fleeting mists. Soon the cloud

Formed more compact & to the zenith rose.
The bright blue of the [deletion]mountains[/deletion] [insertion]distance[/insertion] then 

was lost.

And all the mountains showed their craggy crests
Of ancient chestnuts dark & deep in shade
To the feverish flush of the meridian sun
Suceeded quick a damp & sudden chill
The lightning flashed at first a feeble light
Scarce seen even in the darkest part of heaven
Suceeded by low murmurings Brighter glowed
Suceeding flashes & now louder roared
The thunder; yet a distance: but it 

soon became.
The loudest nearest burst of heavens artillery
- The whirlwind gone -
A calm, a freshness soon succeed
