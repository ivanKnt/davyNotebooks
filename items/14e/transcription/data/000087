87

Cast thine eyes upwards in the vault of

heaven
Ten thousand stars pour forth their 

brilliant light
That mingle in the ether
Look at the brightest 

of these orbs
My place of birth my heritage 

The space
Which midst these brilliant stars to thee 

appears
Mere emptiness & void, Is filled with life
But of a nature all unlike to thine
Thy breathe, not hear not see not
But derive from impulse & powers to thee 

unknown
Sources of sense & thought
