Aug [superscript]1[/superscript] 1819
He who passes from flower to flower
& from fruit to fruit enjoying their
fragrance & their sweets may
sometimes be pricked by the thorns
round the rose or stung by a 
wasp on the peach: but the
anguish is transient as the cause
He is truly wretched who having
all his life raised one flower
& cultivated one fruit finds the

fragrance & the taste destroyed by
a frost & the thorns alone remaining
& the fruit fair & fresh without
but with the worm rottenness
& corruption within.
