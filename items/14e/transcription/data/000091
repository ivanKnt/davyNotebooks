What if the stars themselves
Be but a different animated world
Of which our narrow intellect can form
No just conception. What if each bright orb
In the act of pouring forth its flood of light
Should feel intensest pleasure & the globes

That dance in everlasting circles [deletion]cor[/deletion]

round
Should in the attractive power which 

moves them onward
Feel a holy glow like that of purest love.
Light & life profusely were before our 

little globe
An atom in the universe appeared.
And when [deletion]it is known[/deletion] it ceases to

exist
With all its weak memories Light

& life
Shall be as now â€“
