Thus brightest round the stagnant pool 

arise
Luxuriant grass & flowers of purest

dyes.

From poisonous steams their hues 

their fragrance flow.

They purify the air in which they grow.

[Horizontal rule] 
Time was when all was fresh
When Immortality itself appeared
But as a [unclear]due[/unclear] of justice; when every 

perishable opening flower
Of changeful odour & of transient hue
Appeared as amaranth bud filled 

to shine

In the triumphant crown of fame

undying
When in the world, the dead & the unknown
In their mysterious attributes of 

greatness
These were my companions,
