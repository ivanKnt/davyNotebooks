Around his brows there shines no 

laurel wreath
No need of conquest gained by death
But that fair civic crown [deletion]of ancient[/deletion] 

[deletion]oak[/deletion]

from Umbrias 

shades
Which blooms in [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] verdure

in the glades

Of blest Parthenope, which Roman senates

gave

To the pure patriot not the imperial

slave. 
Not that the pride of Britains wood

Not that which stems the angry flood
who bears the red cross burning
Amidst the lightning flash of war

And ceaseless thunder turning
But are [deletion]embalmed[/deletion] [insertion]nurtured[/insertion] by [insertion]the[/insertion] widows tears
[deletion]By[/deletion] [insertion]the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] Tamed by the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] grateful [unclear]scythe[/unclear] 

Which its green head superbly rears 

–In joy & immortality –
