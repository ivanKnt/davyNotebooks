Ulswater Aug 4. 1825.
Ye lovely hills that rise in majesty
Amidst the ruddy light of setting suns
Your tops are bright with radiance whilst [insertion]below[/insertion]
The wave is dark and gloomy and the plain

Hid in the obscurest mist. Such is the life
Of Man. This vale of earth and waters dark
And gloomy: but the mountain range above
The skies, the heavens, are bright: There is a ray
Of evening which does not end in night;
A Sun of which we catch uncertain gleams
In this our mortal state, but which
For ever shines, wakening the spirit of man
To life immortal and undying glory.
