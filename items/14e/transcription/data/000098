Is destroyed by [deletion]heat[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] which is not changeable
The granite rock, the mightiest of the mighty
The burden of the earth, yields to the dews
Of heaven:- the particles of which intangible
Act through the lapse of ages with a [insertion]strength[/insertion]
Sure and irresistible -
So worlds are worn away! So Monuments
Raised by the labour of a myriad race
Vanish before the frosts, the sunshine
And the winds of heaven!
