Such are the Eternal laws, acting in power
As if Eternal justice was their end.
So the forms of animated nature changing [insertion]changeable[/insertion].
From the most sordid & imperfect forms
Rise to a glorious and etherial life
Lo, that which grovels in the dust
In darkness or the stormy bosom of the flood
Rises on radiant wings and like a seraph
Sports in the blaze of that which seems its god
Earth rises into dew, and dew assumes
The powers of air; and air in heat
And light melts into subtler and more noble [insertion]forms[/insertion]
The slave becomes the master, and the might
And genius of the Elements subdued
Even like the fabled Proteus yields [insertion]to[/insertion] what
Appears the feeblest of [insertion]all[/insertion] natural powers
That which seems most everlasting
