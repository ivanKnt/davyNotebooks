Aug 1. Copenhagen [underline]24[/underline][underline]
[/underline]Whatever burns, consumes: Ashes remain.
And though in beauty and in loveliness,
And infinite variety of forms, 

Matter Beings
The primitive substance shone; their relics sad
Have the same pale and melancholy hue.
Such are the traits strong passions leave behind; 
Consumers of the mind and of the form.

The auburn, flaxen, and the ebon hair
Take the same hoary hue. The blooming cheek
Of beauty, [deletion]of[/deletion] the bronzed [deletion]brow[/deletion] [insertion]brow[/insertion] of manly vigour [insertion]strength[/insertion]
And [insertion]the[/insertion] smooth front of Wisdom, sadly shew

The same deep furrows. Intellect alone,

Does not so quickly waste itself: and like

That [insertion]tranquil[/insertion] light which in the ocean springs [deletion]of life[/deletion] 

When living myriads in succession quick 

Sport in the wave - it [deletion]lasts[/deletion] [insertion]lives[/insertion] and in the storm

And change of things appears more [deletion]brilliant[/deletion] [insertion]beautiful[/insertion]
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] Triumphant oer the elements.
