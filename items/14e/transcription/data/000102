It is a time for minstrelsy:
For round those walls what magic forms
Appear in grace and harmony.
The pencil of the artist warms
The coldest scenes, and powers sublime
Awakening moral forms of things
And new creation, steal from time
His scythe, and close his wings.

-
It is an hour for minstrelsy
For social converse wakes the mind
To pure and happy sympathy
And elegance and taste refined.
-

Call to the hospitable board
The force of reason and the flow
Of memory with wisdom stored
Which might awake a grateful glow
