103

It is a time for minstrelsy
For still the laurel blooms around
And bay. And fancy's dreaming eye
Can see through mists the fairy ground,
And hill and dale and woodlands green
And lakes which pastoral meads surround;
The distant ocean, and a scene
At home where blossoms rise around
And Nature gains from Art new powers
Charms that in happy union meet
Where wild and cultivated flowers
Together blend, their odours sweet.
