Ashburnham Place Jan[superscript]y[/superscript] 22.

1823. - -

Is this a time for minstrelsy?

When Nature rests in death like sleep,

And roots & buds and herbage lie

Embalmed in icy cerements deep.

-

When scarce a stream is heard to flow

And scarce the distant woods appear

So widely spreads the drifted snow,

The mantle of the new born year.

When the wild songsters of the grove

Shivering around the mansion fly

Without a single note of love,-

Is this a time for minstrelsy?
