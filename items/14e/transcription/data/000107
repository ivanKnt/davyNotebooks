In curling [deletion]ringl[/deletion] ringlets seemed as

of a [underline]Sybarites[/underline]
Well filled for the odours strong & strange
And for the colours varying where the bay

Was mingled with the dark anemone 
And where the birds & deadly nightshade mixed
Their leaves incongruous with the lilly pale
And humble violet [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] that tranquil hangs

Its [deletion]head[/deletion] dewy head in shade. But not in vain
Has Time upon thy godlike countenance
Thrown its chastened & more [deletion]mellow[/deletion] tranquil tints
And not in vain has given thy raven locks
Some hues of wisdom in their silver light
