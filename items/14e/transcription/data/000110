[underline]Corrected Stanza[/underline][underline]
[/underline]to be added to the Poem
on the death of L[superscript]d[/superscript]. [underline]Byron[/underline].
Now passing near those high & blessed
abodes
Where Beings of a [deletion]higher[/deletion] [insertion]nobler[/insertion] nature 

move
In fields of [insertion]purest[/insertion] light. Where [deletion]intellectual[/deletion] [insertion]brightest[/insertion]

rays

of Glory shine. In power allied to Gods
Whose minds etherial & undying prove 

that

Truth in its brightness, [insertion]hot[/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] Eternal blaze

[deletion]Which man sees slowly [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]

Whose hearts are warm with everlasting love. 

Whose minds in Life & in practice prove

That unconsuming & etherial blaze
Flowing from returning to Eternal love
