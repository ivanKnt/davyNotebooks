To [underline]Love[/underline].

Thou who art so cunning
So bright & heavenly fair
Which is thy beginning
And ending. It is care.
First a sigh then a smile
The honest vows then guile

Amidst the moonlight bowers
And wreathes of rosy flowers.
Then come jealous hours
Then rapture then fears
And thou endest in showers
of [unclear]sparks[/unclear] or of tears

-

Or
And then endst in a shower of tears
Of despair or repentance or joy.
