pure their bids. -
Verses.
They do not kindle at my glory

They do not love my name in story
The selfish feeling uncontrasted
In narrow minds usurps the throne
Which in the spirit lofty bold:
Is little known or known alone

To be disposed & conquered

Yet that to which the mind alone

Applied its own [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] measure

Though facts & feelings all are gone
be still as age a sacred treasure 

In solitude T'was mine to own 
The mighty dead & the unknown
And pure & hallowed sympathies
For them took their were work

to rise
