Manhood power & passion. Sunshine
& the full leaf & blossom. -
The productive autumn of life
its quiet peaceful & lazzy days

The fruit formed more permanent

The brightening of intellect & its
highest perfection before failure 

In winter coldness & feebleness 

Roots or hoarded fruit the
stores of mind. In other respects

a second infancy.

[Horizontal rule]
How much is life in all its varied hues
And course & current like a mighty stream

And there are streams which are for ever pure
And which perennial from their sources youth
With the same force & mystery

fed from heaven

Without a saint of earth so
