The flow of time & of Mortality.-

Yet vain His hopes & vain His aspirations
Imperial Rome who in her power & pride
Raised her high piles for distant generations
Like mighty floodgates in times restless tide.-
E'en by [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]her[/insertion] works destroyed [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]her[/insertion] childrens power
For those accomplished in inglorious sloth
The Emperor wasted [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] the [insertion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/insertion] [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] clover
Of greatness was destruction. And the Goth
Like the old Gaul had found the Roman [insertion]steel[/insertion]

[deletion]sword[/deletion]. 
Weightier than gold; but that there was no arm

Of strength to wield it & no mind to feel
And such is then with all his majesty
His glory & his power
He puts on like them his wedding garments

But to weep & die
And all his mighty fields of glory
