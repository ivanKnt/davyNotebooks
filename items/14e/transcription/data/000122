1824 to the Wandle

or [underline]Vandalis[/underline].

Full twenty summers now have passed away.

Time past O Vandalis by thy pure stream

I lingered through a happy summers day

Just as becomes the Poets fairest dream.

Nature was beautiful. The sun was bright

But sometimes clouded. In the genial strife

Of Elements. [underline]Warmth[/underline] was more strong his 

light

And kindled in the air & waters life

Green were the trees & meadows even where

[deletion]tints[/deletion] hues

Of yellow [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]azure[/insertion] crimson tinted flowers

And pear & apple blossoms bright with dews

Opened in fullest bloom to catch the showers

The Nightingale from noon to eventide

Sung blithe his song of love and perfect joy

Filling the wood reaching the valley wide

A song that proved his loved one was not

coy.
