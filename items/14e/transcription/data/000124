And the soft whispering of the vernal wood.
And caverns bursting with the living stream
In foam descending from the precipice
And sparkling in the sunshine 

Nurturing with dews

A thousand odorous plants & fragrant flowers
In the secret music of the vernal woods.
From winged minstrels & the louder sounds
Of mountain storms & thundering cataracts
The Voice of inspiration well might 

come.

[Horizontal rule]

- Amidst the [underline]copious feast[/underline] of
Natural form & the rich harmony
of Nature sounds. Poetic visions rise
with all the power of prophecy.
The Soul is present past & future

to itself
The Image of the Eternal [underline]deity[/underline].
Carrara
Two hundred centuries are past
Since first the Roman Warrior rode
Disturbed thy mighty solitude
Raised on the base [underline]the quarried stone[/underline]
