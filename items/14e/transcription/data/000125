Of objects sensible not yet revealed
In noontide brightest on the Syrian Mount
For thee the Eternal Majesty of heaven
In all things lived & moved & to its power
And attributes [deletion]Poe[/deletion] imagination [insertion]poetic fancy[/insertion] gave
The forms of human beauty strength & grace
The Naiad murmured in the silver stream
The Dryad whispered in the nodding wood
Her voice the music of the Zephyrs breath
On the blue wave the sportive Nereid moved
Or blew her conch amidst the echoing rocks
I wonder not that moved by such a faith
Thou raised the sybils temple in this vale
For such a scene was suited well to raise
The mind to high devotion. To create
Those thoughts indefinite which rise above
Our sense & reason & the hallowed dream
Prophetic. In the sympathy sublime
With natural forms & sounds the mind forgets
Its former being. Images arise
Which seem not earthly. Midst the awful rocks
