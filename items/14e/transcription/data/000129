Thy lips warm pressure wakes no thought
Unworthy of the [deletion]sainted name[/deletion] [insertion]sainted name[/insertion] virginâ€™s fame virgins

[deletion]Which is not worthy thee & me[/deletion] 

But gives me hopes allied to heaven

Which [deletion]may[/deletion] [insertion]will[/insertion] survive this earthly frame.
Hopes such as sainted Vestals know-

[deletion]Thy virtue is to me as dear[/deletion]
[deletion]As my own life, nay dearer far [insertion][deletion]And in thy Kiss[/deletion][/insertion]

[deletion]And if I shed thus a transient tear [insertion] & loved no less[/insertion][/deletion]
[deletion]It is a tear of happiness[/deletion]
Thy innocence I [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]seem[insertion] to share:

And [deletion]yet[/deletion] [insertion]sure[/insertion] I share thy happiness, 

[underline]to the same[/underline]

The light that [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]wakens[/unclear] in thy eye.

So [deletion]bright[/deletion] [insertion]mild[/insertion] so pure so soft so clear
Is of that fire not meant to die

Which never glitters through a tear
The Vestals fire, or sacred light
[deletion]Its source a hope of heavenly bliss[/deletion]
[deletion]Devotions flame for ever bright[/deletion]
[deletion]A Virgin that a saint might kiss[/deletion].
