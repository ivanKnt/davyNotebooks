[underline]To Josephine Dettela[/underline]
Kiss me Pepina, kiss again
Thy kisses will become a sage
They waken in my heart a hope
Which was not of my [deletion]y[/deletion]early age.
A hope a blessed father feels
A hope the much loved brother knows
A hope which heaven itself reveals.
Of that love which purest glows.

[horizontal rule]
And from its purity derives
Its claim to immortality
That [underline]fire[/underline] which stains [insertion]wastes[/insertion] our early lives
Though burning brightly burns to die
But when thy angel form I see
And gaze upon thy bright blue eye
And watch thy calm [deletion]unpassioned[/deletion] [insertion]& holy[/insertion] smile[instertion]s[/insertion]
And know thy virgin purity.
