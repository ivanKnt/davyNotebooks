And here when [underline]once[/underline] with [insertion][deletion]eager[/deletion] deepest holy[/insertion] rapture glowing
I propel thee [insertion]willing[/insertion] to my eager arms. -
[insertion]Alass[/insertion] Whilst tears of [underline]purest grief[/uncerline] are flowing
How [deletion]bright a view[/deletion] [insertion]fair [deletion]an apparition[/deletion] vision[/insertion] of thy [insertion]youthful[/insertion] charms

[deletion]fair vision[/deletion] 
Wakes in my mind, a rainbow light

Upon the dark & falling storm.
[deletion]And little rests in[/deletion]
I seem to know thee [unclear]blest in blesses[/unclear] bright
As was the beauty of thy earthly form

in C. [unclear]xxx xxx xxxxx[/unclear]:

[deletion]For thee [underline]wert innocence[/underline], one fault alone[/deletion]
[deletion]were thine. To love[/deletion] me. I am.-
[deletion]Which[/deletion] 
Where in my [insertion]exhausted suffering[/insertion] mind - a vision bright
[deletion]So bright[/deletion]
Bright but not burning, [insertion][deletion]lovely[/deletion] placid[/insertion] pure [deletion]yet[/deletion][insertion]yet[/insertion] warm
Those [insertion][deletion]copious[/deletion][/insertion] tears it sheds a [insertion]glorious[/insertion] rainbow

light
Upon the [deletion]dark[/deletion] [insertion]glowing cold[/insertion] & [insertion][?xxxxx] falling storm
Age of [deletion]weakness[/deletion], desolation
Of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] weakness [deletion]coldness[/deletion] grief

And [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] [insertion]a living[/insertion] power [insertion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] &[/insertion] divine

Gives to my wearied bosome calm relief
And seem from [insertion]highest[/insertion] heaven itself to shine
