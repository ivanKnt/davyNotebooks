[deletion]Oer the long night [unclear]xx[/unclear] bright[/deletion] 
[deletion]Its radiance oer the [underline]azure of the[/underline] [insertion][unclear]& glowing seas[/insertion][/unclear][/deletion]

Its cheering radiance oer [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] [insertion]charm[/insertion] & [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] [insertion][deletion]night[/deletion][/insertion]

Rests its full orb [deletion]still in dying lustre[/deletion]

 upon the [deletion]bright[/deletion] oceans 
[deletion]Upon the oce[/deletion] bed

- And throws its lustre o'er the western sea

And makes the western sea its tranquil pillow

Lost in the wave its radiance

The [deletion]memory of[/deletion] pleasures past which never

can return.

Like [insertion]covered[/insertion] ashes in the heart remain
And without flame or glow [deletion]will[/deletion] [insertion]ing ever[/insertion] burn.
But thou art [insertion]pure &[/insertion] free from earthly stain


Mondsee. June 28. 27.
Virtue in its influence on life
from its beginning to its end
may be compared to the full Moon
guiding the pilgrim in his
nightly journey & pointing
in setting in the west to 
the brighter & more certain
guide the sun [insertion]setting in the east[/insertion] from
which her light was but
a faint reflection/thought
of early youth 32 years ago, when
I was 18 + & versified then
in Annual Anthology 1799.
Virtue the daughter of the skies
