Virtue in its influence on life
from its beginning to its end
may be compared to the full Moon
guiding the pilgrim in his
nightly journey & pointing
in setting in the west to 
the brighter & more certain
guide the sun [insertion]setting in the east[/insertion] from
which her light was but
a faint reflection/thought
of early youth 32 years ago, when
I was 18 + & versified then
in Annual Anthology 1799.
Virtue the daughter of the skies 

supreme

Directs their life informs their tuneful lays
Her heavenly redeemer with a tranquil beam
From morn to even gilds their happy days
Where lifeâ€™s warm fountains feel the frost

of time
When the chill dews of darkness [unclear]press[/unclear] their

eyes
