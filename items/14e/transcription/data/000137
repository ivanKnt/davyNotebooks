those [underline]had[/underline] been
The Solar light when the bright orb

has sunk

Dwells not in known space
And that which kindleth the
whole frame of nature

Has no known abode, altho its

source
Is everlasting. It burns but to decay
And in its course a million miles

are nothing

It passes from & to & through

the infinite
So in our life of thought we look

not back
Beyond a few short hours.
A life, a day an age
That period [deletion]passed[/deletion] gone
We blend with future & with 

past eternity. â€“
