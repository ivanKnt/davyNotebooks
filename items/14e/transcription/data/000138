[Horizontal rule]

In ignorance of all things we assume
What reasonings most please us & in 

things

The most unlike in form as well as 

essence

We trace analogies as if it were
A Joy to blend all contrarieties & to

discover
In things the most unlike come qualities

Showing relationships & family ties
Thus life we term a spark a fire

a flame
And then we call that fire that flame

immortal
Although the Nature of all fiery things

Belonging to this earth is perishable
The lightning in its fierceness & its power
Is of an instant only.
The Meteors blaze lighting the visible

universe
Is as transient
And verily should we search when
