For infinite wisdom & unbounded

power
Its organs fail alone for they are

dust

Is it not possible that the 
mind or indestructible percipient
principle may acquire in the
progress of intellectual actions
powers almost of an infinite
kind & may not one mind
be at length creative &
all percipient, & may not 
organized frames be likewise

effects of the first workings
of such a plastic or creative
principle.
