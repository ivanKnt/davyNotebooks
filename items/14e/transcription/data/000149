When after all his struggle & vain efforts
He must at last obey. rebelling gainst

the love

Which would have made him happy.
Is not this the History of Man.
Of that bright & beauteous garden where
In innocence & ignorance He lived

& loved
Till the fatal taste of knowledge

Made him wretched. And [underline]He knew[/underline][underline]
[/underline][underline]That He must die[/underline]. And is not this
The glory & consummation of the Christians

faith
Which gives him back his innocence
[deletion]Of immortality[/deletion] [insertion]His confidence in god[/insertion] which through his life [insertion][deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] his hopes[/insertion]
Still tilds the picture with a

golden blessing.

Of an expected immortality.-
Man fell in Adam knowledge was his

bane.
Man saw in [underline]Christ[/underline] recovering his

ignorance
Or substituting [underline]hope[/underline] for what was

[underline]doubt[/underline].-
