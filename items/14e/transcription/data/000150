the road [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] Laybach. April

20 - 27.
For time has withered all the
lovely flowers
That once adorned my youthful coronet
And death has cut & utterly destroyed 

That beauteous tree which for two

[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] bore

Perennial roses having all the hues

& scents
Of vernal flowers, yet like the amaranth
Blooming in wintry frost & summer

heat.

Our [underline]real kn[/underline]owledge is but to be sure
That we know nothing & I can but doubt

+If this be curse or blessing those who hope

Trust & believe are surely happier far
Then those who doubt and the submissive child
Who of his fathers goodness is secure
Is far more that than He the forward one

Who sets himself against [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]his[/insertion] powerful will
