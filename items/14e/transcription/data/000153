[deletion]Rise in a stout gigantic [unclear]column[/unclear][/deletion]

Stand like a tree above.
Een in my heart
By sickness weakened & by sorrow chilled
The balm of [deletion]kindness[/deletion] [insertion]calmness[/insertion] seems to penetrate
Mild soothing genial in its influence
Again I feel a freshness & a power
As in my youthful days & hopes &

thoughts
Heroical & high. The wasted frame
Soon in corporeal strength recruits

itself

And wounds pale with new flesh

So in the mind [deletion]the death of objects[/deletion]

The death of objects & the loss of hopes
Are [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] in the end succeeded by some births
Of new creative faculties & powers
Brought [insertion]forth[/insertion] with [deletion]pangs[/deletion] [insertion]pains[/insertion], such as the mother
E'en with her first born: [insertion]feels[/insertion] but like [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]

vigorous child

Repaying [deletion]by their[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] beauty for the pang.
