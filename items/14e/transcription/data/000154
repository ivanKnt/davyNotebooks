Again that lovely [deletion]orb[/deletion] [insertion]lamp[/insertion] from half its

orb
Sends forth a mellow lustre that

pervades
The eastern sky & meets the rosy light
Of the last sunbeams dying in the west
The mountains all above are clear

& bright
[deletion]Their[/deletion] great forms distinctly visible
Crested with shaggy chesnuts, or erect
Bearing the helmed pine, or raising high
Their marble columns crowned with grassy

slopes
From rock to rock the foaming Lima

pours
Fell from the thunder storm, rapid & strong
And turbid. [deletion]Still[/deletion] [insertion]Hushed[/insertion] is the air in silence
The smoke moves upwards & its curling waves
[deletion][unclear]Mem. xxx as if[/unclear][/deletion]
