Ravenna - April 5
When life was new then every

verdant tree
Seemed cloaked [insertion]trimmed[/insertion] with laurels which

to my free head
Seemed to offer themselves,
And every [insertion]humble[/insertion] mind [deletion]seemed[/deletion] was

cloaked with flowers.
I saw the rose; but never saw
the thorn.
I saw the brilliant [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] adder[/deletion] [insertion]snake[/insertion]
but [deletion]not its poison fang.[/deletion] [insertion]never felt[/insertion] 

Its poison fang, or [deletion]suffered[/deletion] or even its

rude harsh scales. 
When every voice was sweet

& soft its sound

A voice of praise, [insertion]or love[/insertion] & every flower
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] seemed[/deletion] [insertion]Appeared[/insertion] to form a wreath

of festal joy.
And every leaf a gem in some bright
[deletion]field[/deletion] crown

Of civic honour or the poets
