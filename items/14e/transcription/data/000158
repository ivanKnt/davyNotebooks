tardy spring
Oft had I seen you midst the orange

[deletion]trees[/deletion] bowers
That Cloak Parthenope

& where Velino pours
In thundering cataracts; But neâ€™er before

When flowers & fruits [deletion]together[/deletion] [insertion]mature[/insertion] alone together grow

But brightly do ye move in fiery showers
Seen like the falling meteor from afar

Be but - a different animated world

In what a high & lofty [insertion]breath[/insertion] world of life

strife.
Commands the elements & bids them move

[deletion]The constant change produced by constant love

In animation, to the voice of love
