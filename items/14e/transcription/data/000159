To the fire flies, the
same place & summer
written in blank verse but not Rhyme
in May & June 1827.
Ye moving stars that flit along

the glade
Ye anchored lamps that midst the shade
Of ancient chestnuts on the lofty hills
Of Lucignano, by the foaming rills
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
Which feed Blue Serchio, in the evening

play. 
[deletion]Making the twilight your[/deletion]
So bright your light that in the unbroken

ray
Of the meridian morn it brightly shines
How [deletion]lightly[/deletion] gaily do ye pass beneath

the vines

Which clothe our nearest hopes
Now through the groves

Of Lucca do ye dance, the breeze that moves
Their silver leaves, a mountain Zephyrs
