At the Baths of Lucca. 1819.19
And may not all the varied life of 

Man

Be but a larger dream.

Sometimes in dreams
We catch the feeble echoes as it were
Of other painted dreams. In infancy
The origin of life is lost to memory
Yet powers existed of [insertion]a[/insertion] glorious nature
Reason & thought & feeling, How we

know not

Nor is there aught that teaches from what

lamp

The flame of human life had caught its

fire
So dreams have no connection, yet

the past

Arises sometimes in them
And they may
Image the future.
