On the death of Lord Byron
composed at Westhill in the 
great storm, Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 1824

Gone is the Bard, who like a powerful

spirit
A beautiful but fallen child of light
Of fiery seraphs, the aspiring peer
Seemed fitted by his nature to inherit
A wilder state than that the genial

strife
Oh mighty Elements have given our sphere
Fixed in a stated round its course to

run
A chained Slave around the master sun
2
Of some great comet He might well

have been
The habitant that through the mighty

space
Of kindling ether rolls, now visiting
Our [deletion]little world[/deletion] [insertion]glorious sun[/insertion] By wondering myriads seen
