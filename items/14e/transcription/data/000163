Ravenna April 2 - 27
Our human Histories of ancient
things
Are like the wrecks upon the

stormy shore
Things are known of heaven
They are light & worship
Or become entangled in seaweed
the prejudices & passions
Of vague matters.

The storms of revolutions bring
forth filth.
The gems of zeal work
on
