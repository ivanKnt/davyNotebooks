Ravenna. April 2. 27.
Our life is like a cloudy sky
Midst mountains

When in the blast the vapours float
Now rapid gleams of light pass

over lovely hills,
And make more lovely the purple

heath green grass & russet bracken
Now a dark giant shadow 

hides them all. 

And in the farthest distance 
of pasturely gloom

& alternate sunshine

fear & hope succeed.

[underline]And of another [deletion]land[/deletion] & unknown[/underline]

land

[underline]We see the sunshine in the[/underline]

clouds reflected.

Which is the future life beyond
the grave. â€“ 


untouched by waves or storms [insertion]the still calm or fathomless abyss[/insertion]

are rarely seen

Our Histories of Wars & earthquakes
[unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
But [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of the virtues
of the good.
