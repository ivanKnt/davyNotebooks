E'en with respect to human things & forms

We estimate & know them but

In solitude. The eye of the worldy Man

Is insect like

Fit only for the near & single object

The true philosophers [deletion]at[/deletion] in distance sees them

And scans their forms their bearings & relations

To view a lovely lanscape in its whole

We do not fix upon a single tree or rock

Or wooded hill out of the range

Of the whole scenery. We rather mount

A [deletion]distant[/deletion] lofty knoll & mark the varied whole

The waters blue, the mountains grey & dim

The shaggy hills & the embattled cliffs

With their mysterious glens awakening

Imaginations wild & interminable
