It is alone in solitude we feel

And know what powers belong to us
By sympathy excited & by constrained
By tedious ceremony in the world
[insertion]Many we are fit to lead
We follow een inferiors
And fools & confident men & those who think

Themselves all knowing from the littleness
Of their own talents & the spheres they move in
Which is most little govern the world.

[insertion]Een like the poets dream of elder time[/insertion]

The fabled Titans imaged to aspire
To the infinitely distant heaven

Because they raised a pile of stones
And higher stood than those around them.

The greatest is ever 
Obscure & indefinite & knowledge still
The highest the most distant most sublime
Is like the stars composed of luminous points
But without visible image or known distance
