1825
And when the light of life is flying
And darkness round us seems to close
Nought do us truly know of dying
Save sinking in a deep repose
And as in sweetest soundest slumber
The mind enjoys its happiest dreams
And as in stillest night we number
Thousands of worlds in starlight reams
So may we hope the undying spirit
In quitting its decaying form

Breaks forth new glory to inherit
As lightning from the gloomy storm.
