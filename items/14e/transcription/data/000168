Then on his [deletion]mind[/deletion] [insertion]soul[/insertion] flashed
the bright images
Of what He was in youth 

when power & beauty [deletion]formed[/deletion] [insertion]moved[/insertion]
[unclear][deletion]his livid[/deletion] looks[/unclear]

[deletion]his turning mind active mind[/deletion]
[deletion]Which moved a body[/deletion]
To seek for power and beauty
& the [underline]ideal[/underline] was far more
vivid than the real now.
When power was his the
undying power of mind
And beauty such as
in the god of light imaged
in marble by the grecian
hand
called for admiring

[Horizontal rule]
That e'en as a [unclear]wish[/unclear] Would be nothing
at all. â€“
