fragments feb 12. 1825
We know that whence our origin
we drew
Or when from dust we first
essayed to climb
Whither amidst creations grand 

& new
We started into being, when sublime
the Eternal wind proclaimed the

birth of time
Or if we are of but a moment past
Unknowing what we were of what 

we are

we [unclear]guess[/unclear] & hope seeking a station

high
But ever changing how the mighty heir

Of immortality the scraps [unclear]xxx[/unclear] we
We claim & to the treats of highest
heaven aspire.

[Horizontal rule]
When broken down authors with worn out

brains
By booksellers cut & slender in means
May find a [unclear]retreat[/unclear] or a pension so 

small
