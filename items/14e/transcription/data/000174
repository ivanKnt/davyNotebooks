But what the span of the 

Almighty mind.

We ne'er can know To wonder

to adore

Is givn to Man In some new

state to find

A nobler fitter intellectual lore

What we have been we know not

What we are is [unclear]dimly xxxxx[/unclear]

Dark as futurity

Save where some gleams of light

most fecund – though fair

From heaven proclaim we

do not [underline]wholly[/underline] die. –
