Naught do we truly know of Man
Of Nature. Of their birth & origin
And destinies & end yet do we see
though dimly, in the constant laws

of things

An order - an intelligence, a power

Which is the principle of life &

thought
Nay life itself- e'en as is our own

mind
There is a one presiding principle
Which for the body acts Een so in

this
The visible universe, a spirit [insertion]thus[/insertion] moves

Omnipotent.
And in the birth of Man &

in his history.

There is distantly imaged faith

a Knowledge of futurity
Which is to us omniscience
All connected beings too possess

All that is necessary for their wants
