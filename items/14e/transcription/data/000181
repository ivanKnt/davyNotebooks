Gold is shortly to come from
the mexican works
In such plenty that no
one will use silver forks.
Our plate will be had into
[deletion]pans[/deletion] saucepans & kettles.
We shall laugh at the [deletion]fools[/deletion]
sages who hoarded their metals
We have copper that will not
[unclear]dissolve[/unclear] in the sea.

The patent secures it quite

from decay
And makes it in voyages

bright as the day,
But every one knows who is
not as ass [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

That the worth of their copper

depends upon brass
