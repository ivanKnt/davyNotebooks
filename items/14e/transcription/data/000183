[underline]Thought[/underline].
The hope that other ages
which in light

More glorious than those
feeble beams which shine

in this wan twilight
Shall distinctly see what
we imagine
And we feebly hope
The world intractable in which
alone
Wisdom is found. the life
& light of things
The breath divine creating
power divine
The One of which the human
intellect

Is but a type as feeble

as that image
