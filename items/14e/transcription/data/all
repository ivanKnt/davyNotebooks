Delivered to the waters, yet preserved

A boat advanced towards him, rude in form
Of twisted osiers framed to meet the strength

Of troubled cataracts. No living form

Tracing the fleecy clouds, that seemed to move
From heaven to earth, - now on the mountains [insertion]top[/insertion]
Resting on Canopy of purple light;
Now through the valley floating as a sea
Of undulating mist. Glad was his mind:
The loftiness of joy upraised his heart:
In nature and her mighty forms he saw
The plenitude of wisdom, and he felt this power
That moves invisible in energy,
At once the soul of each and life of all.

The inert rocks, the solid stones,

Change slowly; but this dust remains
And every atom measured, weighed,
Is whirled by blasts along the plains
Or in the fertile furrow laid.

The drops that from the transient shower
Fall in the noon-day, bright and clear
Or kindle beauty in the flower,
Or waken freshness in the air;

Nothing is lost. The ethereal fire
Which from the furthest star descends
Through the immensity of space, 
Its course, by worlds attraction bends.

For ever shines, wakening the spirit of man
To life immortal and undying glory.

And roots & buds and herbage lie

Embalmed in icy cerements deep.

Shivering around the mansion fly

Time past O Vandalis by thy pure stream

I lingered through a happy summers day

Just as becomes the Poets fairest dream.

Nature was beautiful. The sun was bright

But sometimes clouded. In the genial strife

Of Elements. [underline]Warmth[/underline] was more strong his

And kindled in the air & waters life

Green were the trees & meadows even where

And pear & apple blossoms bright with dews

Opened in fullest bloom to catch the showers

Filling the wood reaching the valley wide

A song that proved his loved one was not

coy.

Thousands of worlds in starlight reams

In quitting its decaying form

Breaks forth new glory to inherit
As lightning from the gloomy storm.
