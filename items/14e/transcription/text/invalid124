or [underline]Vandalis[/underline].

Full twenty summers now have passed away.

Time past O Vandalis by thy pure stream

I lingered through a happy summers day

Just as becomes the Poets fairest dream.

Nature was beautiful. The sun was bright

But sometimes clouded. In the genial strife

Of Elements. [underline]Warmth[/underline] was more strong his 

light

And kindled in the air & waters life

Green were the trees & meadows even where

[deletion]tints[/deletion] hues

Of yellow [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]azure[/insertion] crimson tinted flowers

And pear & apple blossoms bright with dews

Opened in fullest bloom to catch the showers

The Nightingale from noon to eventide

Sung blithe his song of love and perfect joy

Filling the wood reaching the valley wide

A song that proved his loved one was not

coy.

And caverns bursting with the living stream
In foam descending from the precipice
And sparkling in the sunshine 

Nurturing with dews

A thousand odorous plants & fragrant flowers
In the secret music of the vernal woods.
From winged minstrels & the louder sounds
Of mountain storms & thundering cataracts

if powers believed by the vulgar

Is it not possible that the

And scans their forms their bearings & relations

The waters blue, the mountains grey & dim

The shaggy hills & the embattled cliffs

With their mysterious glens awakening

And darkness round us seems to close
Nought do us truly know of dying
Save sinking in a deep repose
And as in sweetest soundest slumber
The mind enjoys its happiest dreams
And as in stillest night we number
Thousands of worlds in starlight reams
So may we hope the undying spirit
In quitting its decaying form

Breaks forth new glory to inherit
As lightning from the gloomy storm.

Such art thou, mighty in
thy power & pride
No city of the earth with thee can vie
Along thy streets still flows the
unceasing tide
of busy thousands. Ee'n thy misty sky
Breathes life & motion. And the
subject waves
That wash thy lofty arches
bear the wings
