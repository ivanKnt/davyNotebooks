Palazzo Campenilla -
I observed a small insulated
[deletion]mountain[/deletion] hill [insertion]apparently[/insertion] entirely composed
of travertine & from its summit
there were [deletion]masses[/deletion] [insertion]formations[/insertion] of tufa which
have evidently been produced
by running water but the whole
mass was now perfectly dry
& incrusted by vegetables. At
first I suspected that this
little mountain had been formed
by a jet of calcareous water a
[deletion]&[/deletion] a kind of small [insertion]fountain analogous to the[/insertion] Geiser which
had deposited travertine & continued
to rise through the basin flowing
[deletion]under the atmospheric pressure[/deletion]
from a higher level but
the irregular form of the
eminence did not correspond
to this idea & I remained
perplexed with the [deletion]phaenomenon[/deletion] [insertion]fact[/insertion]
