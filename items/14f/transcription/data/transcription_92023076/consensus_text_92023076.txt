destroyed in a tremendous storm
I was blasted by lightning
from heaven; [insertion]He raised his withered hand to his face & eyes[/insertion] but suffered
to live & expiate my crime
in the flesh. My [deletion]life[/deletion] [insertion]has[/insertion] [deletion]was to[/deletion] been
spent in constant &
severe penance & in that
suffering of the spirit produced
by guilt [insertion]& is to be continued[/insertion] as long as any [deletion]remains[/deletion] [insertion]part[/insertion]
of the temple of Jupiter in
which I renounced my faith remains
[deletion]in this place continued to[/deletion]
[deletion]exist.[/deletion] [insertion]in this place[/insertion] I have lived through
15 tedious centuries; but I 
trust in the mercies of omnipotence
& I hope my atonement is
compleated - I now stand on 
the dust of the pagan temple
You have just thrown the last
fragment of it over the rock
My time is arrived, I come - As
He spoke the last words
He rushed toward the sea
