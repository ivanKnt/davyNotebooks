a very near & dear relation
[insertion]&[/insertion] I left my two friends
Ambrosio & Onufrio to
pursue their travels which
were intended to be of
some extent & duration.-
In my youth & through
the prime of Manhood, I never
entered London without
feelings of pleasure & hope.
It was to me as the great
theatre of intellectual activity
the field for every species
of enterprise & exertion.
The Metropolis of the
world of business thought
& action. There I was sure
to find the friends & companions
