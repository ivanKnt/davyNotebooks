produced by the mournful
event which recalled me
to my country: but owing
likewise to an entire
change in the condition
of my [insertion]physical[/insertion] moral & intellectual
being-
My health was gone.
My ambition was satisfied-
I was no longer excited by
the [deletion]love[/deletion] [insertion]desire[/insertion] of distinction. What I
had loved most tenderly was in
the grave,- & to take a
metaphor derived from the
change produced by time
in the juice of the grape
My cup of life was no
longer sparkling, sweet
