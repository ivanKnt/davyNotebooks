Of all the climates of [deletion]the[/deletion]
Europe England seems
to me most fitted for
the activity of the Mind
& the least [deletion]fitt[/deletion] suited
to repose, the [deletion]changes[/deletion] [insertion]alterations[/insertion]
of a Climate so various
& rapid continually awaken[deletion]s[/deletion]
new sensations: & the changes
[insertion]in the sky from dryness & the blue etherial[/insertion] to moisture, [deletion]& the[/deletion] cloudiness
& fogs seem to keep
the nervous system in
a constant state of disturbance,
[deletion]Employment in such a state[/deletion]
[deletion]of the atmosphere seems almost[/deletion]
[deletion]necessary to [deletion]guard[/deletion] ward off[/deletion]
[deletion]the attacks of ennui[/deletion]
