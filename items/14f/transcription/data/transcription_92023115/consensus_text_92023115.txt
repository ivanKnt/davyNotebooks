last days of life more tran-
-quilly & more agreably than
in the metropolis of my own
country. Nature never deceives
us, the rocks the mountains
the streams always speak
the same language, a shower
of snow may hide the verdant
woods in spring a thunder
-storm may render the blue
limpid streams foul and
turbulent but these effects
are rare & transient In a
few hours or at most days
all the sources of beauty are
renovated & nature affords no
continued trains of misfor-
tunes & miseries such as
depend upon the constitu
-tion of humanity, no hopes
