but had less of the poetical
temperament than any
person whom I had ever
known with similar vivacity
of mind. He was a severe
thinker with great variety
of information, an excellent
physiologist & an accom-
=plished chemist In his
reasonings he adopted the
precision of a geometer
& was always upon his guard
against the influences of
imagination. He was passed
the meridian of life & his
health was weak like my
own so that we were well
suited as travelling compani
-ons moving always slowly
from place to place with
out hurry or fatigue.
