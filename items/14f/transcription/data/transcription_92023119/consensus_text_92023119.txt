I shall call this friend
Eubathes-
I shall say nothing of
the progress of our journey
through France & Germany.
I shall dwell only upon that
part of it which has
still a strong interest
for me & where events
occurred that I shall
never forget.-
We passed into the
Alpine country of Austria
by Lintz on the Danube
& followed the course
of the Traun to Gmunden
on the Traunsee or
Lake of the Traun
