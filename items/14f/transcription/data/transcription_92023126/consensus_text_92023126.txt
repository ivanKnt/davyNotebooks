the rainbow upon the bright
Sun above my head as if taking
leave for ever of that glorious
luminary. I raised one pious
aspiration to the divine
Source of life & light. I
was [insertion]immediately[/insertion] stunned by the thunder
of the fall & my eyes were
closed in darkness. How long
I remained insensible I know
not. My first recollections
after this accident were of
a bright light shining
above me of warmth &
pressure in different parts
of the body & the noise [deletion]like[/deletion]
[deletion]that of[/deletion] the rushing cataract
sounding in my ears.
