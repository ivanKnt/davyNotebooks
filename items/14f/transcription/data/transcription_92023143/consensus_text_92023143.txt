power in the small lake
beneath our feet on which
the flame of the torch is
now falling for there it
is that I expect to find
the extraordinary animals
which have been so long
the objects of my attention
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] I see three or four
creatures like slender
fishes moving on the mud
below the water. [deletion]I[/deletion]
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] I see them
they are the Protei. Now
I have them in my fishing
net and now they are safe
in the pitcher of water.
At first view you might
suppose this animal to be
a lizard but it has the
motions of a fish
