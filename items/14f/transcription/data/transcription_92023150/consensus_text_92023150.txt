This animal I dare say is
much larger than we now
see it when mature in its
native place, but its com-
-parative anatomy is ex-
ceedingly hostile to the
idea that it is an animal
in a state of transition
It has been found of va-
=rious sizes from that of
the thickness of a quill to
that of the thumb but its
form & organs have been
always the same. It is
surely a perfect animal of
a peculiar species & it adds
one instance more to the
number already known
of the wonderful manner
in which life is produced
