[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] With the highest
respect for the memory of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Black & for the opinions of his
disciple I shall answer the ar-
-guments I have just heard. I
will not allow any facts or
laws from the action of dead
matter to apply to living structures
The blood is a living fluid &
of this we are sure that it
does not burn in respiration
the terms warm & cold as applied
to the blood of animals are
improper in the sense in
which they have been just
used, all animals are in fact
warm blooded & the degrees
of their temperature are fit
=ted to the circumstances
under which they live.
