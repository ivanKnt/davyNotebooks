The stranger said, When you
return to Latium I advise
you to pay another visit
to this Spot which is in
teresting from a number
of causes some of which
I will take the liberty
of mentioning to you.
You have only seen one
lake that where the
ancient Romans erected
their baths but there is
another a few yards above
it surrounded by very high

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00006|dnp14f004pp|92022992[/page]
rushes & almost hidden by
them from the right; this
lake sends down a con-
siderable stream of tepid
water to the larger lake
but this water is less
strongly impregnated
with carbonic acid; the
larger lake is actually
a saturated solution of
this gas which escapes
from it such quantities
at some parts of its
surface that it has the

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00007|dnp14f005pp|92022993[/page]
5
appearance of being actu-
-ally in ebullition. I have
found by experiment that
the water taken from
the most tranquil part
of the lake even after
being agitated & exposed
to the air contained in
solution more than its
own volume of carbonic
acid gas with a very small
quantity of sulphuretted
hydrogen to [insertion]the presence of[/insertion] which I con
-clude its
ancient use in curing

I found in the winter in
the warmest parts between
80° & 90° of Fahrenheit and
its appears to be pretty
constant for I have
found it nearly the
same in the same
places in January, March
May and the beginning of June
it is therefore supplied

atmosphere. Kircher [insertion]Kircher[/insertion] has

the heat of boiling water
& that floating islands
rise from the gulf

certainly be very difficult

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00010|dnp14f008pp|92022996[/page]
or even impossible to
fathom a source which
rises with so much vio-

excavation, & at a time
when Chemistry had made
small progress it was
easy to mistake the dis
engagement of carbonic

are real but [insertion]neither[/insertion] the Jesuits
nor any of the writers

this lake had a correct
idea of their origin which
is exceedingly curious:
the high temperature of
this water & the quantity
of carbonic acid that it
contains renders it pecu
=liarly fitted to afford a
pabulum or nourishment
to vegetable life; the
banks of travertine are
every where covered with
reeds, lichens, confervee
& various kinds of acquatic
vegetables, and at the

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00012|dnp14f010pp|92022998[/page]
same time that the
process of vegetable
life is going on, the
crystalizations of the
calcareous matter
which is every where
deposited in consequence
of the escape of car-

proceed giving a con-

fluid - So rapid is the ve-
=getation in consequence
of the decomposition
of the carbonic acid
that even in winter
masses of confervae &
lichens mixed with
deposited travertine are
constantly detached by
the currents of water
from the bank and
float down the stream
which being a consider

surface, they are some-
-times only a few inches
in size & composed [deletion]only[/deletion] [insertion]merely[/insertion]
of dark green confervee
or purple or yellow
lichens but they are
some times even of some

contain seeds of various
species of common water

the surface would be
fatal to them if they
ventured to swim upon
it when tranquil. In
May 1814 I fixed a stick
on a [deletion]surface[/deletion] [insertion]mass[/insertion] of Travertine
covered by the water and
I examined it in the be-
-ginning of April 1815
for the purpose of de-
-termining the nature of
the depositions: the
water was low at this
time & had left the
place in which it

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00020|dnp14f018pp|92023006[/page]
was deposited. I had
some difficulty by
means of a sharp poin
-ted hammer of breaking
the mass which adhered
to the bottom of the
stick it was several
inches in thickness: the
upper part was a mix-
-ture of light tuffa &
the leaves of confervae
below this was a darker
& more solid Travertine
containing black &

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00021|dnp14f019pp|92023007[/page]
19
decomposed masses of
confervae. In the lower
part the Travertine was
more solid & of a grey
colour but with cavities
which I have no doubt were
produced by the decompo-
-sition of vegetable matter.
I have passed many
hours I may say many
days in studying the
phaenomena of this
wonderful lake, it has
brought many trains of
thought into my mind

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00022|dnp14f020pp|92023008[/page]
connected with the
early changes of our
globe & I have sometimes
reasoned [deletion]upon[/deletion] [insertion]from[/insertion] the forms
of plants & animals
preserved in marble
in this warm source
to the grander depo-
-sitions in the secondary
rocks where palms &
vegetables now unknown
are preserved with the
remains of crocodiles,
turtles & gigantic

21
[deletion]unknown[/deletion] [insertion]extinct[/insertion] animals of the
sauri genus & which
appear to [insertion]have[/insertion] belonged to a period
when the globe possessed
a much higher temperature.
I have likewise often
been led from the
remarkable phaenomena
surrounding me to [insertion]in that spot[/insertion] to compare
the works of man with
those of Nature, the
baths erected there nearly
20 centuries ago present
only heaps of ruins & even
the bricks of which they were
built though hardened by
fire are crumbled into
dust. Whilst the masses of

materials have hardened

most perfect remains

in the eternal city.
such as the triumphal
arches & the collosaeum
owe their duration to
this source.
Then from all we know
this lake [insertion]except in some change in dimension[/insertion] continues nearly
in the same state
in which it was described 1700
[insertion]years ago[/insertion] by Pliny & I have no
doubt contains the same

kind of floating islands the
same plants & the same
insects, During 15 years
that I have known it
it has appeared precisely
identical in these respects
& yet it [deletion]appears [insertion][deletion]recent[/deletion][/insertion] as[/deletion] has
[insertion]the character of an[/insertion] accidental phaenomenon
depending upon subterraneous
fire. How marvellous
then are those laws by
which even the humblest
types of organic existence
are preserved even when
born amidst the sources
of their destruction &
by which a species of immortality

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00026|dnp14f024pp|92023012[/page]

like evanescent bubbles

what may be called its Spirit in
[deletion]disipated in[/deletion] the Atmosphere.
These last observations
[insertion]of the stranger[/insertion] recalled to my recollection
some phaenomena which
I had observed many years
ago & of which I could then
give no satisfactory explanation
- I was shooting in the marshes
which surround the [deletion]ex[/deletion]
ruins of Gabia & when
there are still remains
[insertion]supposed to be[/insertion] of the Alexandrine aqueduct

Palazzo Campenilla -
I observed a small insulated
[deletion]mountain[/deletion] hill [insertion]apparently[/insertion] entirely composed
of travertine & from its summit
there were [deletion]masses[/deletion] [insertion]formations[/insertion] of tufa which
have evidently been produced
by running water but the whole
mass was now perfectly dry
& incrusted by vegetables. At
first I suspected that this
little mountain had been formed
by a jet of calcareous water a
[deletion]&[/deletion] a kind of small [insertion]fountain analogous to the[/insertion] Geiser which
had deposited travertine & continued
to rise through the basin flowing
[deletion]under the atmospheric pressure[/deletion]
from a higher level but
the irregular form of the
eminence did not correspond
to this idea & I remained
perplexed with the [deletion]phaenomenon[/deletion] [insertion]fact[/insertion]

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00028|dnp14f026pp|92023014[/page]
& unable to satisfy myself
as to its cause. - The views
of the stranger [deletion]afforded it[/deletion]
appeared to me [deletion]an adequate[/deletion]
[deletion]solution to n[/deletion] now to make
it probable that the [insertion]calcareous[/insertion] water
had issued from [insertion]ancient[/insertion] leaks in
the [deletion]alexandrine[/deletion] aqueduct &
formed a hillock which had
[unclear]incased[/unclear] [deletion][unclear]xx xxxx[/unclear] &[/deletion] [insertion]the bricks of the erection[/insertion] which in
[insertion]other parts[/insertion] when not incrusted by travertine
had [deletion]fallen[/deletion] become entirely
decayed degraded & removed
from the soil.- I mentioned
the circumstance & the
suspicious of its nature
The stranger said you
are perfectly correct in
your idea I know the spot

will & if you had not
mentioned it I should probably
have found it is an instance
in which the works of art
are preserved as it were
by the accidents of Nature,
I was so struck by this appearance
last year that I [deletion]removed the[/deletion]
had the travertine partially
removed by some workmen &
I found beneath it the canal
of the aqueduct in a perfect
state & the bricks of the
arches [deletion]almost[/deletion] as [deletion]perfect[/deletion] [insertion]uninjured[/insertion] as
if freshly laid.-
The Stranger had hardly
concluded this sentence when
He was interrupted by
Onuphrio - Who said I have

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00030|dnp14f028pp|92023016[/page]
always supposed that in
every geological system, Water
is considered as the cause of
the destruction or degradation
of the surface - but in
all the instances that
you have mentioned it
appears rather as a
conservative power not
destroying; but rather
producing
It is the [insertion]general[/insertion] vice of philosophical
systems replied the stranger
that they are [insertion]usually[/insertion] founded upon
a few facts which they well
explain & are extended
by the human fancy to
all the phaenomena of Nature

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00031|dnp14f029pp|92023017[/page]
29
to many of which they [deletion]are[/deletion] must be
contradictory, the human
intellectual powers are so
feeble that they can with
difficulty embrace a single
series of [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion]phaenomena[/insertion] & they consequently
must fail when they
would extend to the whole
of Nature. - Water by its
common operation [insertion]as poured down from the atmosphere[/insertion] in rain
& rivers tend to level &
degrade the surface & carry
the materials of the land into

on the contrary in Volcanic
eruptions usually raises mountains

islands even in the midst
of the sea -: but these
laws are not invariable
as the instances to which
we have just referred prove

The stranger said I have certainly

The stranger. On these
matters I had facts
to communicate. On the
geological scheme of the early History
of the globe there are only antiques
to guide us which different
Minds may apply & interpret
in different ways but I
will not trifle with a long
preliminary discourse.-
[deletion]Mathematical demonstrators[/deletion]
Astronomical deductions &
actual measures by triangulation
prove that the globe is an

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00035|dnp14f033pp|92023021[/page]
33
Oblate [deletion]speroid[/deletion] spheroid flattened

know by strict mathematical
demonstrations is precisely the
one which a fluid body
revolving [deletion]at[/deletion] round its axis
& become solid [insertion]at its surface[/insertion] by the slow dissipation
of its heat or other causes
would assume.
I suppose therefore that this
globe in the first state
in which the imagination
can venture to consider it
was afluid mass with an
immense atmosphere
revolving in space round
the sun & that by its

[deletion]occupying[/deletion] [insertion]which occupied[/insertion] a part of the
Surface: in this state
no forms of life such as
now belong to our system
could have inhabited it
& I suppose the crystalline
rocks or as they are called
[insertion]by geologists[/insertion] The primary rocks which
contain no vestiges of a
former order of things
were the results of the
first consolidation of its
surface, Upon the further

more or less had covered it
[deletion]the surface[/deletion] contracted
& islands appeared in the

covered with vegetables

& various species [deletion]similar to[/deletion]
of plants similar to those
which now exist[deletion]s[/deletion] in the
hottest parts of the world
& the shores of these new

covered with acquatic ve-

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00038|dnp14f036pp|92023024[/page]
species of shellfish &
common fishes found
their nourishment The

aglutinating together
the sand & some of the

The stranger answered - I beg
you to consider the views
I have been developing as
merely hypothetical, one
of the many resting places
that may be taken by the
imagination in considering
this subject.- There are however
[deletion]I think other[/deletion] [insertion]distinct[/insertion] facts in favour
of the idea that the interior
of the Globe has a higher
temperature than the surface,
The heat increases in mines

& the number of warm

all countries are certainly
favorable to the idea.-
The [deletion]notion[/deletion] [insertion]opinion[/insertion] that Volcanoes
are [deletion]dependent upon[/deletion] [insertion]owing to[/insertion] this
general and simple cause
is I think likewise more
agreeable to the [deletion]general[/deletion]
analogies of things than
to suppose them dependent
upon partial chemical
changes such as the action
of air & water upon the
combustible basis of the
earths [insertion]& alkalies[/insertion] though it is extremely
probable that these substances
may exist beneath the
surface & may occasion

some of the results of Volcanic
fire & on this subject
my [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]notion[/insertion] may perhaps b
the more trusted as for a
long while I thought volcanic
eruptions were owing to
[deletion]the s[/deletion] chemical agencies of
the newly discovered metals
& I made many researches
& some dangerous experiments
[deletion][insertion]in vain[/insertion][/deletion] in the hope of confirming
this notion; but in vain.-
[underline]Ambrosio[/underline]: We are very much

You are obliged to have recourse

is this verisimility in your

[underline]Ambrosio[/underline]. you mistake my

passage
Onufrio. Having resided
for a long while at Edinburgh
and having heard a number
of discourses on the Theory
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton or the plutonic
theory of Geology and having
been exceedingly struck both
by its simplicity and beauty
its harmony with existing
facts and the proof afforded
to it by some beautiful
chemical experiments, I do
not feel disposed to renounce
[deletion]upon them[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] for the views which
I have just heard explained.

For the principal facts which
our new acquaintance has
stated [deletion]would I think have[/deletion]
[deletion]been so definitively explained[/deletion]
[deletion]by Professor Playfair[/deletion] are
I think not inconsistent
with the refined philosophical
system of Prof[superscript]r [/superscript] Playfair and
Sir James Hall -
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. I have
no objection to the refined
[underline]Plutonic[/underline] view as [insertion]capable of[/insertion] explaining
many existing phaenomena. Indeed
what I contend against is
its application to [deletion]the[/deletion]

Onuphrio I am not quite convinced
by your arguments. Supposing
the lands of New Holland were
to be washed into the depths

[page]66|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00066|dnp14f064pp|92023052[/page]
of the oceans & to be raised according
to the Huttonian View as a secon-
dary stratum by subterraneous
fire they would contain the
remains both of vegetables
& of animals entirely different
from any of the strata formed
by the old continents & may
not those peculiar formations
to which you have referred be
as it were accidents of na-
=ture belonging to p[deletion]articular[/deletion]eculiar
parts of the globe? & you
speak of a diluvian for-
=mation which I conclude
you would identify

65
with that belonging to the
catastrophe [insertion]described[/insertion] in the sacred
writings in which no human
remains are found: now you
surely will not deny that
Man existed at the time of
this catastrophe & he consequent-
-ly may have existed at the
period of the other revolutions
which [deletion]have[/deletion] are supposed to be produced [deletion]by[/deletion] in
the Huttonian view by such
Terraneous fires -
The Unknown. I have made use
of the term diluvian because
it has been adopted by geologists
but without meaning to identify

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00068|dnp14f066pp|92023054[/page]
the cause of the formations
with the deluge described in
the sacred writing. I apply
the term merely to signify
loose & waterworn strata
not at all consolidated & deposi
-ted by an inundation of water
& in those countries which they
have covered man certainly
did not exist. With respect
to your argument derived
from New Holland it
appears to [insertion]me[/insertion] [deletion]be[/deletion] to be without
weight: In a variety of
climates & in very differ-
=parts of the globe

[page]69|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00069|dnp14f067pp|92023055[/page]
67
secondary strata of the
same order are found &
they contain always the
same kind of organic re -
mains which are entirely .
different from any of those
now afforded by beings
belonging to the existing
order of things.
The Catastrophes which
produced the secondary
[insertion]strata[/insertion] & diluvian [deletion]str[/deletion] depositions
could not have been
local & partial phaenomena
but must have extended
over the whole or a
great part of the surface

[page]70|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00070|dnp14f068pp|92023056[/page]
of the globe. The remains
of similar shell fishes
are found in the limestones
of the new & the old
continents. The teeth
of the mammoth are
not uncommon in various
parts of Europe where
skeletons have been found
in America & even the
skin [deletion]&[/deletion] covered with hair
& the entire body of [deletion]these[/deletion]
one of these enormous extinct
animals has been [insertion]discovered[/insertion] [deletion]found[/deletion]
preserved in a mass of
ice in Siberia.

[page]71|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00071|dnp14f069pp|92023057[/page]
69
In the oldest secondary
strata there [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] no remains
of such animals as now
belong to the surface. In
the rocks which may
be regarded as more
recently deposited, these
remains occur but rarely
& with abundance of
extinct species. There
seems as it were a
gradual approach to
[deletion]a[/deletion] the present system
of things: & a succession
of destructions & creations
preparatory to the
existence of Man.-

The monuments of extinct

are as perfect & as
convincing as those of

[underline]The Stranger[/underline]. One of you
referred in our conversation
this morning to [underline]a vision[/underline]
which had some relation
to the subject of our discussion
& I was promised some
information on this subject.
[deletion][underline]Philalethes[/underline]. I willingly[/deletion]
[deletion]give it.[/deletion] I immediately
gave a sketch of my
vision & of the opinions
which had been expressed
by Ambrosio on the
subject of the early
History of Man & the
termination of our discussion

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00084|dnp14f082pp|92023070[/page]
on religion [deletion]subjects[/deletion] -
Here two more accounts
The Stranger I entirely agree
with Ambrosio in opinion on
the subjects you have just
mentioned. In my youth I
was sceptical & this I believe
is usually the case with
young persons given to general
& discursive reading and ac-
=customed to adopt something
like a mathematical form
in their reasonings & it was
in considering the nature
of the intellectual facculties
of brutes as compared with
[deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]those[/insertion] of man and in examining
the nature of instinctive fac-
=culties that I became a be-

=liever. After I had found the
idea that revelation was to
man in the place of an instinct
my faith constantly became
stronger it was exalted by
many circumstances I had
occasion to witness in a journey
that I made thro' Egypt and
a part of Asia Minor & by no
one more than by a very re-
markable dream which oc-
=curred to me in Palestine
& which as we are all almost
at the hour of the Siesta I will
relate to you tho' perhaps
you will be asleep before I
have finished it. I was
walking along that

[deletion]He gave me the idea of one[/deletion]
[deletion]of those sacred idiots who[/deletion]
[deletion]are so often seen & are so[/deletion]
[deletion]much respected in the East[/deletion]
I found a very different
figure.- He was a very
old Man with a beard as
white as snow. His countenance
was dark but paler than
that of an arab & his features
stern wild & with a peculiarly
savage expression [insertion]His form was gigantic; but his arms were withered & there was a large scar on the left side of his face which seemed to have deprived him of an eye.[/insertion]
a black turban & black flowing
robes & there was a large
chain round his waist which
clanked as He moved.- It
occurred to me that He
was one of the Santons
or sacred Madmen so
common in the East & I retired
as He approached towards me.-

not harm one - you shall hear

you - He spoke in [insertion]arabic but in[/insertion] a peculiar

every word.- You see before You
He said a Man who was educated
a Christian but who renounced
the worship of the one Supreme
God [deletion]wo[/deletion] for the superstition
of the pagans. I became
an Apostate in the reign
of the Emperor Julian &
I was employed by that Soverin
to superintend the reerection
of the Temple of Jerusalem
by which it was intended
to belie the prophecies & give
the death blow to the holy
religion - History has

to live & expiate my crime

spent in constant &
severe penance & in that
suffering of the spirit produced

which I renounced my faith remains

15 tedious centuries; but I 
trust in the mercies of omnipotence

& disappeared - |_ I heard no
struggling & saw nothing but a gleam
[deletion]glow dark[/deletion] of light from the
wave that closed above him.
I was now roused by the
cries of my servant & of the
Janisary who were shaking
my arm & who informed [insertion]me[/insertion] that
my sleep was so sound that
they were alarmed for me.
When I looked on the sea
there was the same light
& I seemed to see the very
spot in the wave where
the old Man l sunk, I was
so struck by the vision that
I asked if they had not seen
something dash in the wave
& if they had not heard
some body speaking to me
as they arrived. Of course

their answers were negative.
[deletion]This dream independent of[/deletion]

In passing through Jerusalem

& the conformity of the [deletion]state[/deletion] [insertion]fate[/insertion]

I had likewise been reading
Gibbons eulogy of Julian

attempts made by that

temple. So that the

it was so vivid & the image
of the subject of it so peculiar
that it long affected my
imagination & whenever I
recurred to it strengthened
my faith.-
[deletion][underline]Ambrosio[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]Onuphrio[/insertion] I believe all
the narratives of Apparations
& Ghost stories are founded
upon dreams of the same
kind as that which occurred to
you - An ideal representation

exactly coincides with its

reality in waking.-
The Stranger, [deletion]it is[/deletion] [underline]I agree[/underline]
with you in your opinion
If my Servants had not
been with me & my dream
had been a little less
improbable it would
probably have been difficult
to have persuaded me that
I had not been visited
by an apparation.

[deletion]I had referred in another[/deletion]
[deletion]conversation[/deletion] the Guardian
Angel of my recovery; who
almost seemed to me to be
present [deletion]in my bed room[/deletion]
by my bedside.
Ambrosio - In confirmation
of this opinion of Onufrio
I can mention many instances
I once dreamt that [deletion]there[/deletion] [insertion]my door[/insertion]
[insertion]had been forced that there[/insertion] were robbers in my room
& that one of them was actually
putting his hand before my
mouth to ascertain if I
was sleeping naturally. I
awoke at this moment &
was some minutes before
I could be sure whether
it was a dream [insertion]or[/insertion] a reality

from my own experience.

to the [deletion]peculiar[/deletion] dulness
of my imagination -
I suppose the more
intense power of reverie
is a symptom of the
poetical temperament &
perhaps if I possessed
more enthusiasm, I should

Ambrosio. Your glory
will [insertion]be[/insertion] greater in establishing
a new character & I trust
even the conversation of
this day has given you
an additional reason to
adopt [underline]our[/underline] faith.-
Ambrosio [deletion]said[/deletion] spoke
these last words with
a correctness unusual
to him & with something
of a tone which marked
a zeal for proselytism &

at the same time He cast
his eyes on the Rosary which
was suspended round the neck
of [deletion]a[/deletion]the stranger & I said
I hope I am not indiscreet
in saying our faith.-
The Stranger - I was
educated in the ritual
of the church of England. I
belong to the Church of
Christ. The Rosary which
you see suspended round
my neck is a memorial
of sympathy & respect
for an illustrious Man
I will if you will alllow

it is connected you will
not find devoid of
interest.-
I was passing through France
in the reign of Napoleon
by the peculiar privilege [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]granted to[/insertion]
a Scavant on my road
into Italy. I had just
returned from the holy
land & I had in my
possession 2 or 3 of

By aspecial favour on the plea of my return [insertion]from the holy land[/insertion]

had made [insertion]it a[/insertion] precious [insertion]relict[/insertion] to me &
I returned it to my neck round
which it has been ever since

some unimportant questions
respecting the state of the
Christians at Jerusalem &

It was 18 months after this
interview that I went out
with almost the whole

illustrious father of the
church into his capital.
He was borne on the shoul-
=ders of the most distinguish
-ed artists of Rome headed
by Canova & never shall
I forget the enthusiasm
with which he was received.
It is impossible to describe
the shouts of triumph & of
rapture sent up to hea-
=ven by every voice & when
he gave his benediction
to the people there
was a universal prostration
& sobbing and marks

[page]105|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00105|dnp14f103pp|92023091[/page]
103
of emotions of joy which
seemed almost like the
bursting of the heart, I
heard every where around
me cries [insertion]of "the Holy father![/insertion] [insertion]the most holy father![/insertion] His restoration
is the work of God, I saw
tears streaming from the
eyes of almost all the
women about me, many
of them were sobbing
hysterically & old men
were weeping as if they
had been children. |_ I pressed
my rosary to my heart on
this occasion & [insertion]I[/insertion] repeatedly
touched with my lips that

with a kind of hallowed
feeling as the memorial

firmness, meekness and

to his church & to human
nature: & it has not only
been useful to me by its
influence upon my own
mind but it has enabled
me to give pleasure to
others & has I believe

been sometimes beneficial
in ensuring my personal
safety. I have often grati-
-fied the peasants in Apuleia
& Calabria by presenting
them to kiss a rosary from
the holy sepulchre which had
been hallowed by the lips
& benediction of the pope
& it has been even respected
by & procured me a safe
passage thro' [deletion]hordes[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]two parties[/deletion] a party[/insertion] of

[underline]Onuphrio[/underline]. The use you
have made of this relic
put me in mind of a
device at a very ingenious
geological philosopher
now living. He was on 
Etna & of busily employed

treasures: it occurred to him
to make the following
speech to them: "I have
been a great sinner in
my youth & as a penance
I have [deletion]resolved[/deletion] [insertion]made a vow[/insertion] to carry
away with me a [deletion]certain[/deletion]

absolution for my sins"-
This speech produced the
desired effect. The peasants
shouted the holy man! the
saint!  & gave him every
assistance in their power
to carry off his burthen
& he made his ample
collections with the utmost
security & in the most
agreeable manner -

The Proteus
or
[underline]Immortality[/underline]
The impression made upon
my mind by the Stranger with
whom we became acquainted
at Paestum was of the
strongest & most extraordinary
kind. The memory of his
person [deletion]& of his conversation[/deletion]
[deletion]for a long while haunted[/deletion]
[deletion]my imagination in a manner[/deletion]
[deletion]that I found unaccountable.[/deletion]
His dress - his manner, [deletion]& even[/deletion]

imagination in a most
unaccountable manner.-
& even formed a part
of my dreams.- It
often occured to me that
this was not the first
time that I had seen him
& I endeavoured but in
vain to find some type
or image of him in
former scenes of my life.
I constantly made enquiries
respecting him amongst
my acquaintance; but I
could never be sure that
any of them knew him
or even had seen him
so great were his peculiarities

It was to me as the great
theatre of intellectual activity
the field for every species
of enterprise & exertion.
The Metropolis of the
world of business thought
& action. There I was sure
to find the friends & companions

of my youth [insertion]to hear the voice of encouragement & of praise[/insertion] [deletion]& objects[/deletion] of
[deletion]pursuit of various kinds[/deletion]
[deletion]connected with interest[/deletion]
[deletion]or ambition.[/deletion] There society
of the most refined [deletion]& diversified[/deletion]
kind offered daily her
banquets to the mind, with
such variety that satiety
had no place in them.
And new objects of interest
& ambition were constantly
exciting attention, either
in politics literature or
Science.-
I now entered this great
city [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] a very different
tone of mind - one of settled
melancholy. not merely

[page]120|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00120|dnp14f118pp|92023106[/page]
produced by the mournful
event which recalled me
to my country: but owing
likewise to an entire
change in the condition
of my [insertion]physical[/insertion] moral & intellectual
being-
My health was gone.
My ambition was satisfied-
I was no longer excited by
the [deletion]love[/deletion] [insertion]desire[/insertion] of distinction. What I
had loved most tenderly was in
the grave,- & to take a
metaphor derived from the
change produced by time
in the juice of the grape
My cup of life was no
longer sparkling, sweet

[page]121|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00121|dnp14f119pp|92023107[/page]

& effervescent. It had lost
its spirit without losing its
power. it was become strong
fragrant & bitter.-
After passing a few months
in England & enjoying as
much as I could enjoy
any thing the society of
the few friends who still
remained alive the desire
of travel again seized me.
I had preserved amidst the
wreacks of time one
feeling strong & unbroken
the love of Natural Scenery
& this in advanced life
formed a principal motive
for my plans of conduct
& action.-

Of all the climates of [deletion]the[/deletion]

to me most fitted for
the activity of the Mind

of a Climate so various

new sensations: & the changes
[insertion]in the sky from dryness & the blue etherial[/insertion] to moisture, [deletion]& the[/deletion] cloudiness

of England. [deletion]tranquillity[/deletion]
To be tranquil is a
labour & employment

the attacks of ennui.-
The English as a Nation
is preminently active. &
the Natives of no other
country follow their objects
whether of love interest or
ambition with so much
force fire & constancy.
And as Human powers are
limited, there are few
examples of very distinguished
Men living [insertion]in this country[/insertion] to old age
They usually fail, droop

& die before they have
attained the period natu[insertion]r[/insertion]ally
marked for the end of
human existence.- The
lives of our statesmen, philosophers
Poets & even Warriors
offer abundant proofs
of the truth of this

In selecting the scenes for my
new journey I was guided by my
former experience. I know no
country more beautiful than
that which may be called the
Alpine country of Austria
including the Alps of the southern
Tyrol those of Illyria, the Noric
& the Julian Alps & the Alps of
Styria & Saltzburg. The variety
of the scenery [insertion]the verdure of the meadows & trees[/insertion] the depths of the
vallies
The altitude of the moun-
=tains the clearness & grandeur
of its rivers & lakes give it

[page]127|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00127|dnp14f125pp|92023113[/page]
125
I think a decided superiority over
Switzerland & the people are
far more agreable, various in
their costumes & manners.
Illyrians, Italians or Germans
the have all the same sim-
=plicity of character & are
all distinguished by their love
of their country, their devotion
to their sovereign, the warmth
& purity of their faith, &
their honesty and with very
few exceptions I may say their
great civility & courtesy to
strangers. In the prime
of life I had visited this spot in
a society which afforded me
the pleasures of intellectual
friendship & the delights of
refined affection. Later I

[page]128|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00128|dnp14f126pp|92023114[/page]
had left the burning summer
of Italy & the violence of an
unhealthy passion & had
found coolness, shade; repose
& tranquility there. In [insertion]a[/insertion] still
later period I had sought for
& found consolation & partly
recovered my health after
a dangerous illness the
consequence of labour &
mental agitation. There I
had found the spirit of my
early [deletion]dream[/deletion] [insertion]vision[/insertion]. I was there-
fore desirous of again
passing some time in these
scenes in the hope of reestab-
=lishing a broken constitution
& tho' this hope was a feeble
one yet at least I expected
to spend a few of the

127
last days of life more tran-
-quilly & more agreably than
in the metropolis of my own
country. Nature never deceives
us, the rocks the mountains
the streams always speak
the same language, a shower
of snow may hide the verdant
woods in spring a thunder
-storm may render the blue
limpid streams foul and
turbulent but these effects
are rare & transient In a
few hours or at most days
all the sources of beauty are
renovated & nature affords no
continued trains of misfor-
tunes & miseries such as
depend upon the constitu
-tion of humanity, no hopes

[page]130|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00130|dnp14f128pp|92023116[/page]
for ever are blighted in the
bud, no beings full of life
beauty & promise taken
from us in the prime of
youth, Her fruits are all
balmy bright & sweet she
affords none of those so
common in the life of Man
& so like the fabled apples
of the dead sea, fresh and
beautiful to the sight but
when tasted full of bitterness
& ashes.- I have already
mentioned the strong effect
produced on my mind by
the stranger whom I had
met so accidentally at
Pestum the hope of [underline]seeing[/underline]
him again was another

129
of my motives for wishing
to leave England & why I
know not yet I had a decided
presentiment that I was
more likely to meet him in
the Austrian states than
elsewhere even than in
England his own country.
For this journey I had one com-
-panion an early friend &
medical adviser. He had lived
much in the world had ac-
-quired a considerable
fortune had given up his
profession & was now re
=tired & sought like myself
in this voyage repose & the
pleasures derived from
natural scenery. He was a
man of a very powerful
& acute understanding

[page]132|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00132|dnp14f130pp|92023118[/page]
but had less of the poetical
temperament than any
person whom I had ever
known with similar vivacity
of mind. He was a severe
thinker with great variety
of information, an excellent
physiologist & an accom-
=plished chemist In his
reasonings he adopted the
precision of a geometer
& was always upon his guard
against the influences of
imagination. He was passed
the meridian of life & his
health was weak like my
own so that we were well
suited as travelling compani
-ons moving always slowly
from place to place with
out hurry or fatigue.

I shall call this friend
Eubathes-
I shall say nothing of
the progress of our journey
through France & Germany.
I shall dwell only upon that
part of it which has
still a strong interest
for me & where events
occurred that I shall
never forget.-
We passed into the
Alpine country of Austria
by Lintz on the Danube
& followed the course
of the Traun to Gmunden
on the Traunsee or
Lake of the Traun

[page]134|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00134|dnp14f132pp|92023120[/page]
where we halted for
some days.-
If I were disposed to indulge
in minute picturesque
descriptions I might occupy
hours with details of
the varous characters [deletion]&[/deletion]
of the [deletion]sc[/deletion] enchanting
scenery in this neighborhood
The vales have that pastoral
beauty & constant verdure
which is so familiar to
us in England with similar
inclosures of [deletion]hedrow[/deletion] hedgerows
& fruit & forest trees, above
are noble hills [deletion]covered[/deletion] [insertion]planted[/insertion] with
beeches & oaks. Mountains
bound the view there covered
with pines & larches there
raising their [deletion]cres[/deletion] [insertion]of marble[/insertion] [deletion]& marble[/deletion]
crests [deletion]above the clouds[/deletion]

133
[deletion]beyond the clouds[/deletion]
capped with eternal snow
above the clouds. The
lower part of the Traun
See is always even in
the most rainy season perfectly
[deletion]clear[/deletion] [insertion]pellucid[/insertion] & the Traun pours
out of it over ledges of
rocks [deletion]fall[/deletion] a [deletion]rive[/deletion] large
& magnificent river
& beautifully clear & of
the purest tint of the beryl.-
The Fall of the Traun
about ten miles below Gmunden
was one of our favorite haunts
It is a cataract [insertion]which when the river is full[/insertion] [deletion]may[/deletion]
may be [insertion]almost[/insertion] compared to that of
Shafhausen for [deletion]its[/deletion] magnitude
& possesses the same peculiar
characters of [deletion]heady[/deletion] grandeur
in the precipitous rush of
its awful & overpowering waters

[page]136|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00136|dnp14f134pp|92023122[/page]
& [deletion]to[/deletion] of beauty in the tints
[deletion]the colours[/deletion] of its stream
& foam & in the forms
of the rocks over which it
falls & the cliffs & woods
by which it [deletion]was[/deletion] is overhung.-
In this spot an accident
which had nearly been fatal
to me occasioned the renewal
of my acquaintance [insertion]in an extraordinary manner[/insertion] with the
[deletion]that[/deletion] mysterious unknown
stranger [deletion]whom I was so[/deletion]
[deletion]desirous of meeting again.[/deletion]
Eubathes who was very
fond of flyfishing was amusing
himself by catching graylings
for our dinner in the
stream above the fall
There were some small boats [deletion]by the[/deletion]
[deletion]side of the stream [insertion]I took one of the boats[/insertion][/deletion] on the river
which are used for descending
the canal or lock [insertion]artificially cut in the rock by the side[/insertion] by which
salt & wood are usually

transported from upper Austria
to the Danube [insertion]I entered one of these boats &[/insertion] [deletion]& desiring[/deletion] I desired
two of the peasants to assist
my servant [insertion]in holding [insertion]a[/insertion] [deletion]the[/deletion] rope [deletion]& in[/deletion] attached to it[/insertion] [deletion]in permitting the[/deletion]
[insertion]to allow the[/insertion] boat to descend slowly by the
sluice below the fall my
intention was to amuse
myself by this roped
species of locomotion along
the decending sluice
For some moments the boat
glided quietly along the smooth
current & I enjoyed the beauty
of the moving scene around me
& had my eyes fixed upon the
bright rainbow: seen upon
the spray of the Cataract
above my head. When I was
suddenly roused by a shout of
alarm from my [deletion]ser[/deletion] servant
[insertion]of the fall[/insertion] & looking round: I saw
that the piece of wood to

[page]138|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00138|dnp14f136pp|92023124[/page]
which the rope had been
attached had given way.
& the boat was floating
down the river at the
mercy of the stream. I was
not alarmed for [deletion]a[/deletion] I saw
that [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]my[/insertion] assistants [deletion]had[/deletion] were
procuring long poles with
which it [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]appeared[/insertion] easy to arrest
the boat before it entered
rapidly descending water of the
sluice & I called out to them
to use their united force
to reach the longest pole across
the water that I might be able
to catch the end of it in my hand
& at this moment I felt [deletion]a[/deletion]
perfect security; but a breeze
of wind suddenly came down
the valley & blew from the

[page]139|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00139|dnp14f137pp|92023125[/page]
137
nearest bank, the boat was
turned by it out of the side
current & thrown nearer to the
middle of the river & I soon
saw that I was likely to be
precipitated over the cataract.
My servant & the boatmen rushed
into the water with their poles
but it was too deep to enable
them to reach the boat. I was
soon in the white water of
the descending stream and
my danger was inevitable
I had presence of mind enough
to consider whether my chance
of safety would be greater
by throwing myself out
of the boat or by remaining
in it & I preferred the latter

[page]140|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00140|dnp14f138pp|92023126[/page]
expedient. I looked from
the rainbow upon the bright
Sun above my head as if taking
leave for ever of that glorious
luminary. I raised one pious
aspiration to the divine
Source of life & light. I
was [insertion]immediately[/insertion] stunned by the thunder
of the fall & my eyes were
closed in darkness. How long
I remained insensible I know
not. My first recollections
after this accident were of
a bright light shining
above me of warmth &
pressure in different parts
of the body & the noise [deletion]like[/deletion]
[deletion]that of[/deletion] the rushing cataract
sounding in my ears.

[page]141|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00141|dnp14f139pp|92023127[/page]
139
I seemed awakened by the
light from a sound sleep
& endeavoured to recall my
scattered thoughts but in vain
I soon fell again into slumber
From this second sleep I was
wakened by a voice which
seemed not al[deletion]l[/deletion] together un-
=known to me & looking up-
=wards I saw the bright eye
& noble countenance of the
unknown stranger whom
I had met at Paestum. I
faintly articulated I am in
another world. "No, said
the stranger, you are safe
in this, you are a little
bruised by your fall but
you will soon be well

[page]142|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00142|dnp14f140pp|92023128[/page]
Be tranquil & compose
yourself, your friend
is here & you will want
no other assistance than
he can easily give you."
He then took one of my
hands & I recognised the
same strong & warm
pressure which I had felt
from his parting salute
at Pestum, [deletion][insertion]when He[/insertion][/deletion], Eubathes
whom I now saw with
an expression of joy
& of warmth unusual
to him gave a hearty
shake to the other hand
& they both said you must
repose a few hours

[page]143|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00143|dnp14f141pp|92023129[/page]
141
longer. After a sound
sleep till the evening
I was able to take some
refreshment & found little
inconvenience from the
accident except some bruises
on the lower part of the
body & a slight swimming
in the head. The next day
I was able to return to
Gmunden where I learnt
from the unknown the his
-tory of his appearance & of
my escape which appeared
almost miraculous to me.
He said, That he was often in
the habit of combining
pursuits of natural

[page]144|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00144|dnp14f142pp|92023130[/page]
history with the amusements
derived from the rural
sports & was fishing the
day that my accident hap-
=pened below the fall of
the Traun for that peculiar
species of the large Salmo
of the Danube which
fortunately for me is
only to be caught by
very strong tackle he saw
to his great astonish-
=ment & alarm the boat
& my body in it preci-
-pitated by the fall he was
so fortunate as to entangle
his hooks in a part of my
dress when I had been

scarcely more than a

by the assistance of [deletion]the[/deletion]

of reasoning with him and
Eubathes upon the state
of annihilation of power

which I had suffered

when in the water but
they both requested me
to defer those inquiries
which required too pro-

thought till [deletion]my health[/deletion] [insertion]as the effects of the shock on my weak[/insertion]
my strength [deletion]were[/deletion] [insertion]was somewhat[/insertion] re-
established & I was the
more contented to comply
with their request as the
unknown Said. It was
his intention to be our
companion for at least
some days longer &
that his objects of pur
-suit lay in the very
country in which we
were making our
summer tour.

It was some weeks before I was
sufficiently strong to proceed
on our journey. for my frame
was little fitted to [deletion]contend[/deletion] bear
[insertion]constitution were over[/insertion] such a trial
as that to which it had been
submitted & considering
the weak state of my [deletion]health[/deletion] [insertion]body[/insertion]
when I was immersed in
the water, I [deletion]consider my[/deletion] [insertion]could hardly avoid[/insertion]
[insertion]regarding my[/insertion] recovery as providential
& the presence & assistance
of the Stranger as in some
way connected with the
future destiny & utility
of my life
In the middle of August
we pursued our [deletion]journey[/deletion] plans
of travel. We first visited
[deletion] the higher lakes of Styria[/deletion] those
high lakes

[page]148|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00148|dnp14f146pp|92023134[/page]
Halstadt Aussee, & [deletion]Ebensee[/deletion] [insertion]Toplitzsee[/insertion]
[deletion]which are the sources of[/deletion]
[deletion]the Traun[/deletion]. which collect
the melted snows of the
higher mountains of Styria
to supply the unfailing
sources of the Traun.-
We visited that elevated
region of the Tyrol which
forms the crest of the
Puster Thal [deletion]&where th[/deletion]
[deletion]in the eastern Tyrol[/deletion]
& where the same chains
of glaciers send down
streams to the Drave &
the Adige, to the black
sea & the Adriatic.-
We remained for many
days in those two [deletion]beautiful[/deletion] [insertion]magnificent[/insertion]
vallies which afford the
sources of the Save

Wurzen & Wochein when
that glorious & abundant
river was as it were in
the very bosom of beauty.
Leaping from its subterraneous [insertion]reservoirs[/insertion]
[deletion]supplies[/deletion] in the snowy mountains
of Terglou & Manhart in
thundering cataracts amongst
cliffs & woods into [deletion]the[/deletion] pure &
[deletion]basons of[/deletion] deep [insertion]cerulean[/insertion] [deletion]blue[/deletion] lakes
& pursuing its [deletion]pastoral[/deletion] course
amidst pastoral [deletion]& ornamented[/deletion]
meadows so ornamented with
[insertion]plants & trees[/insertion]as to look like the garden
of nature.- The subsoil
[insertion]or strata of[/insertion] of this part of Illyria are
entirely Calcareous & full of
subterranean cavities so that
in every declivity large funnel
shaped cavities, like the
Craters of Volcanoes may be

seen, in which the waters
that fall from the atmosphere
are lost & almost every
lake or river has a
subterraneous source
& often a subterraneous
exit. The Laibach
river rises twice from
the limestone rock & is
twice again swallowed
by the earth before
it reaches its final
appearance & is lost in
the Save.
The Cerknitz see or
lake is a [deletion]singular[/deletion] mass
of water entirely filled
& emptied by subterraneous
sources & its natural

history though singular has in
it nothing of either prodigy
mystery or wonder.-
The Grotto of the Maddelena
at Adelsburg [deletion]took[/deletion] occupied
more of our attention than
the Cirknitz see. I will
give the conversation that
took place in that extraordinary
cavern [deletion]at full In[/deletion] entire

no more agreable [insertion]or salutary[/insertion] manner
of taking a cold bath than

fond of natural history
may find in this regard it
has had a peculiar object
of interest for me in the
extraordinary animals
which are found in the
bottom of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] subterraneous
cavities. I allude to the
Proteus Anguinus a far
greater wonder of nature
than any of those which
the Baron Valvasor [otherwork]otherwork_284|detailed[/otherwork]
to the Royal Society a century
& a half ago as belonging
to Carniola with far too
romantic an air for a
philosopher -
[undeline]Philalethes[/underline] I have seen
those animals in passing
thro this country before

[page]154|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00154|dnp14f152pp|92023140[/page]
but I should be very glad
to be better acquainted
with their natural history
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. We shall soon
be in that part of the grotto
where they are found and
I shall be very glad to

power in the small lake
beneath our feet on which
the flame of the torch is
now falling for there it
is that I expect to find
the extraordinary animals
which have been so long
the objects of my attention
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] I see three or four
creatures like slender
fishes moving on the mud
below the water. [deletion]I[/deletion]
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] I see them
they are the Protei. Now
I have them in my fishing
net and now they are safe
in the pitcher of water.
At first view you might
suppose this animal to be
a lizard but it has the
motions of a fish

[page]158|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00158|dnp14f156pp|92023144[/page]
Its head & the lower part
of its body & its tail bear
strong resemblance to
those of the eel but it has
no fins & its curious
bronchial organs are
not like the gills of
fishes but they form a
singular vascular structure
as you see almost like
a crest round the throat
& they may be removed
without occasioning the
death of the animal
who is likewise furnished
with lungs with this double
apparatus for supplying
air to the blood. It can
live either below or

[page]159|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00159|dnp14f157pp|92023145[/page]
157
above the the surface of the
water. Its fore feet resemble
hands but they have only
three claws or fingers &
are two feeble to be of
use in grasping or support
-ing the weight of the animal
the hinder feet have only
two claws or toes & in
the larger specimens are
found so imperfect as
to be almost obliterated
It has small points in the
place of eyes as if to
preserve the analogy
of nature. It is of a fleshy
whiteness & transparency
in its natural state but
when exposed to light
its skin gradually becomes
157

darker & at last gains an
olive tint Its nasal organs
appear large & it is abun-
=dantly furnished with teeth
from which it may be con-
-cluded that it is an animal
of prey yet in its confined
state it has never been
known to eat & it has been
kept alive for many years
by occasionally changing
the water in which it was
placed.
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] Is this the only
place in Carniola where
these animals are found.
[underline]The Unknown:[/underline] They were
first discovered by Baron

it reported that some indivi-
-duals of the same species
have been recognised in
calcareous strata in Sicily.
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] This lake in which
we have seen these animals
is a very small one do you
suppose they are bred here?
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] Certainly not in
dry seasons they are seldom
found here but after great
rains they are often abundant
& I think it cannot be doubted
that their natural residence
is in some great [insertion]deep[/insertion] subterraneous
lake from which in great
floods they sometimes are
forced thro the crevices of

the rocks into this place
where they are found. & it
does not appear to me
impossible when the peculiar
nature of the [deletion]of[/deletion] country
in which we are is considered
that the same great cavity
may furnish the individuals
which have been found at
Adelsberg & at Sittich -
[underline]Eubathes.[/underline] This is a very ex-

with the rest of its organi-
=zation & were they removed
it would have all the
characters of a fish.
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] I cannot be-
lieve that they are larvae
there is I believe in nature
no instance of a transition
by this species of metamor-
-phis from a more perfect
to a less perfect animal,
the tadpole has a resemblance
to a fish before it becomes
a frog. The caterpillar &
the maggot gain not only
more perfect powers of
motion on the earth in
their new state but ac-
=quire organs by which
they inhabit a new element.

[page]164|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00164|dnp14f162pp|92023150[/page]
This animal I dare say is
much larger than we now
see it when mature in its
native place, but its com-
-parative anatomy is ex-
ceedingly hostile to the
idea that it is an animal
in a state of transition
It has been found of va-
=rious sizes from that of
the thickness of a quill to
that of the thumb but its
form & organs have been
always the same. It is
surely a perfect animal of
a peculiar species & it adds
one instance more to the

in which life is produced

It is now ten years
since I first [underline]visited this[/underline]
[underline]spot[/underline], I was exceedingly -
anxious to see the Proteus
& went with the Guide in
the evening of the day I
arrived at Adelsburg: but
though we examined the bottom
of the cave with the greatest
care we could find
no specimens. We returned
the next morning [deletion]and[/deletion] & were
more fortunate for we
discovered five close to the bank
on the mud covering the bottom
of the lake. The [deletion]bottom[/deletion] mud
was [insertion]smooth &[/insertion] perfectly undisturbed
& the water quite clear
The fact of their appearance
during the night seemed

[page]167|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00167|dnp14f165pp|92023153[/page]
165
to me so extraordinary
that I could hardly avoid
the fancy that they were
new creations, I saw no
cavities through which they
could have entered & the
undisturbed state of the lake
seemed to give weight to [deletion]what[/deletion]
[deletion]I suppose you will immediately[/deletion]
[deletion]reject as a vague & delusive[/deletion]
my notion.- My reveries became
discursive I was carried
in imagination back to
the primitive state of the
globe, when the great animals
of the sauri kind [deletion]now extinct[/deletion]
were created under the
pressure of a [deletion]dark &[/deletion] heavy
atmosphere: & my dream
on this subject was not

[page]168|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00168|dnp14f166pp|92023154[/page]
destroyed when I heard
from a celebrated anatomist
to whom I sent the specimens
I had collected that the
organization of the [deletion]bones[/deletion] spine
of the Proteus was analogous
to that of one of the Sauri
[deletion]extinct species[/deletion] [insertion]the remains of which are[/insertion] found in
the older secondary strata.
It was said at this time
that no generation organs
had been discovered in
any of the specimens examined
by physiologists & this
lent a weight to my
opinion of the possibility
of their being actually new
creations; which I conclude
you will condemn as
absolutely visionary &

[underline]unphilosophical[/underline].
[underline]Eubathes[/underline]. From the tone
in which you make your
statements I think you yourself
consider them as unworthy
of discussion. On such ground
eels might be considered
as new creations, for their
mature ovaria have not
been yet discovered & they
come from the sea into
rivers under circumstances
when it is difficult
to trace their course.
The Unknown. The problem
[underline]of the generation[/underline] of the
proteus like that of the
common eel is not yet
solved; but ovaria have

[page]170|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00170|dnp14f168pp|92023156[/page]
been discovered in animals
of both species & in this
instance as in all others
belonging to the existing order

Eubathes. You just now said
that this animal has been
long an object of attention
to you. Have you studied
it as a comparative
anatomist in search of
the solution of the problem
of its generation.
The Unknown. This inquiry
has been pursued by their
able investigators by Schreibers
& Configliachi. My researches

[page]171|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00171|dnp14f169pp|92023157[/page]

were made upon its respiration
upon the changes occasioned
in water by its bronchia
Eub. I hope they have
been satisfactory.
The Unknown. They proved
to me at least that
not merely the oxygene
dissolved in water but
likewise a part of the
azote was absorbed
in the respiration
of this animal.
Eubathes. So that
your researches confirm
those of the french sçavant

the atmosphere are absorbed.-
Phil. I have heard so many
& such various opinions
on the nature of the
function of respiration
during my education &
since that I should like

well know been the subject of an

might have terminated
fatally.-
[deletion]Phil[/deletion]. I shall gladly state gladly
state what I know which is
very little. In physics &
in chemistry the science of
dead matter we possess many
facts & a few principles or laws
but whenever I considered
the functions of life, though
the facts are numerous, yet
know we no principles & laws,
& we must usually end where
we began by confessing
our entire ignorance.

[deletion]The[/deletion]
The [underline]Unknown[/underline] "The powers of the
organic system depend upon
a continued state of change
the waste of the body produ-
ced in muscular action per-
spiration & various secretions
is made up for by the constant
supply of nutritive matter
to the blood by the absorbents
& by the action of the heart
the blood is preserved in per
petual motion through
every part of the body.

[page]176|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00176|dnp14f174pp|92023162[/page]
In the lungs or bronchia the
venous blood is exposed to the
influence of air & undergoes
a remarkable change being
converted into arterial blood.
The obvious chemical alteration
of the air is sufficiently
simple in this process a
certain quantity of carbon
only is added to it & it receives
an addition of heat & vapour.
The volumes of elastic fluid
inspired & ex[deletion]s[/deletion]pired making
allowance for the change of
temperature are the same
& if ponderable agents only
were to be regarded it would
appear as if the only use
of respiration were to

175
free the blood from a certain
quantity of carbonaceous
matter, but it is probable
that this is only a secondary
object & that the change
produced by respiration upon
the blood is of a much more
important kind. Oxygen in
its elastic state has properties
which are very characteristic
it gives out light by compression
which is not the case with
any other elastic fluid except
those into which oxygen has
entered without undergoing
combustion & from the fire
that it produces in certain
cases & from the manner
in which it is separated
by positive electricity

[page]178|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00178|dnp14f176pp|92023164[/page]
in the gaseous state from
its combinations it is not
easy to avoid the supposition
that it contains besides its
ponderable elements some
very subtle matter which
is capable of assuming the
form of heat & light. My idea
is that the common air
inspired enters into the venous
blood entire in a state of
dissolution carrying with
it its subtle or etherial
part which in ordinary cases
of chemical change is given
off that it expels from the
blood carbonic acid gas &
Azote & that in the course
of the circulation its etherial

part & its ponderable part
undergoes changes which belong
to laws that cannot be considered
as chemical - The etherial part
probably producing animal
heat & other effects & the pon

form [deletion]the[/deletion] carbonic acid. [deletion]The[/deletion]
[insertion]and other products. The[/insertion]arterial blood is necessary
to all the functions of life
& it is no less connected with
the irritability of the muscles
& the sensibility of the nerves
than with the performance
of all the secretions.
Euthabes. No one can be more
fully convinced than I am
of the very limited extent
of our knowledge in chemico-
-physiology & when I say that

[page]180|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00180|dnp14f178pp|92023166[/page]
having been a disciple &
friend of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black I am
still disposed to prefer his
ancient view to your new
one, I wish merely to induce
you to pause & to hear my
reasons they may appear
insufficient to you but I
wish to explain them.
First then in all known chemi
cal changes in which oxy
-gen gas is absorbed & car-
=bonic acid gas formed heat is
produced. I could mention a
thousand instances from the
combustion of wood or
spirits of wine to the fer-
=mentation of fruit or the
purtrefaction of animal
matter. This general fact

[page]181|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00181|dnp14f179pp|92023167[/page]
179
which may be almost called a
law is in favour of the
view of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black - Another
circumstances in favour of
it is that those animals
which possess the highest
temperature consume the
greatest quantity of air, &
under different circumstances
of action & repose that heat
is in great measure propor
tional to the quantity
of oxygen consumed. Then
those animals which con-
-sume the smallest quantities
of air are cold blood[deletion]i[/deletion]ed -
Another argument in favour
of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Blacks opinion is the
change of colour in blood
from black to red which
seems to show that it loses
carbon.

[page]182|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00182|dnp14f180pp|92023168[/page]
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] With the highest
respect for the memory of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Black & for the opinions of his
disciple I shall answer the ar-
-guments I have just heard. I
will not allow any facts or
laws from the action of dead
matter to apply to living structures
The blood is a living fluid &
of this we are sure that it
does not burn in respiration
the terms warm & cold as applied
to the blood of animals are
improper in the sense in
which they have been just
used, all animals are in fact
warm blooded & the degrees
of their temperature are fit
=ted to the circumstances
under which they live.

[page]183|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00183|dnp14f181pp|92023169[/page]
181
& those animals the life of which
is most active possess most
heat which may be the result
of general actions & not a par
=ticular effect of respiration.
Besides, a distinguished physio-
=logist has rendered it [deletion]possible[/deletion] [insertion]probable[/insertion]
that the animal heat depends
more upon the functions of
the nerves than upon any
result of respiration. The
argument from the change
of colour is perfectly delusive.
It would not follow if carbon
were liberated from the blood
that it must necessarily become
brighter. Sulphur in combining
with charcoal becomes a
clear fluid & a black oxide
of copper becomes red in
uniting with a substance

[page]184|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00184|dnp14f182pp|92023170[/page]
which abounds in carbon.
No change in sensible qualities
can ever indicate with pre-
=cision the nature of a chemi
-cal change: I shall resume
my view which I cannot be
said to have fully develloped
When I said that carbonic
acid was formed in the
venous blood in the process
of respiration, I meant
merely to say that this blood
in consequence of certain
change become capable
of giving off carbonic acid &
oxygen in union with each
other; for the moment inor-
=ganic matter enters into
the composition of living

183
organs it obeys new laws, the
actions of the gastric juice is
chemical & it will only dissolve
dead matters & it dissolves [underline]them[/underline]
when they are in tubes of metal
as small as in the stomach but
it has no action upon living
matter. Respiration is no
more a chemical process than
the absorption of chyle & the
changes that take place in
the lungs tho' they appear
so simple may be very
complicated. It is as little
philosophical to consider it
as a mere combustion of
carbon, as to consider the for-
-mation of muscle from
the arterial blood as crystali
=zation. There can be no doubt
that all the powers of agencies

[page]186|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00186|dnp14f184pp|92023172[/page]
of matter are employed in
the purposes of organization
but the phaenonema of organi
=zation can no more be referred
to chemistry than those of
chemistry to mechanics. As
oxygen stands in [insertion]that[/insertion] electrical
relation to the other elements
of animal matter which
has been called electro positive
it may be supposed that
some electrical function is
exercised by oxygen in the
blood; but this is mere hypo-
=thesis. An attempt has been
made founded on experiments
on the decomposition of bodies
by electricity to explain secre-
=tion by weak electrical

[page]187|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00187|dnp14f185pp|92023173[/page]
185
powers and to [deletion]imagine[/deletion] [insertion]suppose[/insertion] the glands
electrical organs & even to ima-
-gine the actions of the nerves [insertion]dependent on electricity[/insertion]
These like all other notions
of the same kind appear to
me very little refined; if
electrical effects be the ex-
=hibition of certain powers
generally belonging to matter
which is a fair supposition
then no change can take
place withough their being
more or less concerned, but
to apply the word electricity
to solve the phaenomena the
cause of which is unknown
is merely to substitute one
undefined word for another.
In some animals electrical
organs are found but then
they furnish the artillery
of the animal and means

[page]188|MS-DAVY-11406-000-00188|dnp14f186pp|92023174[/page]
of seizing its prey & its defence
& speculations of this kind
must be ranked with those
belonging to [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]some of the more superficial[/insertion] followers
of the Newtonian philosophy
who explained the properties
of animated nature by
mechanical powers; & muscu-
-lar action by the expansion
& contraction of elastic
bladders. Man in this stage
of [deletion]philosophy[/deletion] [insertion]a vague philosophical enquiry[/insertion] was imagined
a species of hydraulic mach

chemistry was invented [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]became a[/deletion] [insertion]organic structures were soon imagined to[/insertion] be laboratories in
which combinations & de-

187
explosions like those of the
detonating compounds & the
formation of blood from chyle
was considered as a pure
chemical [deletion]composition[/deletion] [insertion]solution[/insertion]; & now
that the progress of science has
opened new & extraordinary
views in [deletion]physical[/deletion] [insertion]electricity[/insertion] these
views are not unnaturally
applied [insertion]by speculation reasoners[/insertion] to solve some of
the mysterious recondite
phaenomena of organized
beings; but the analogy is
too remote & incorrect the

grasped by such machinery
