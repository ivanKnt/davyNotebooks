Rome - April 11. 1819.
Nothing suits this City less than
the pomp, noise & diseased activity
of a court. The feeling produced
by the remains of the works
of that people which conquered
the world and which ultimately
diffused the arts and the letters
of Greece from the mountains
of Taurus and Caucasus to the
wilds of Caledonia is one of
melancholy &sublimity. There
is no analogy between the nothingness
[deletion]greatness[/deletion] of modern state &
the greatness of ancient
The last sovereign
glory. The last sovereign
who claimed the name of
Roman Emperor & who [deletion][unclear]Cont[/unclear][/deletion]
renounced that name to privilege
