ancient Italy - in travelling
through the Sabine country
I found even the woods
purple from the profusion
of a tree with a leaf
like the lime tree &
covered all over with
purple blossoms 
There is abundance of
a marble which seems to
be of the same kind as
Rosso antico in the
walls of Spoleto &
Poligno -
About 3 miles or 4 from
Foligno a fine fall
