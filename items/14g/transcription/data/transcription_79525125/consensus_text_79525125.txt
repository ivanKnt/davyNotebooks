The end of May the
Snow clad mountains above
from which the Velino
rises are bold & rugged
but the hills want

the idea of barreness &
not of boldness - They
talked of trouts in the
Velino I saw some rise
Pesciara, the stones on the side of the 
great road many of them [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] the Rosso antico
