I saw more but I hunted them
too little for a fair trial
at Poggio S[superscript]t[/superscript] Lorenzo
Starna was brought
in which appeared to me
[unclear]2[/unclear] as large as our Partridge
it was red behind the ear
[unclear]2h[/unclear] is it a different species
for are both the [unclear]Cotaria[/unclear]
& Starna, the grey & red
legged partridge - merely
large varieties
All the beauty & sublimity
of the Valley between
Rieti & Terni may
