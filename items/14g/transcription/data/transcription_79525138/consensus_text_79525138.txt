[deletion]Ye moving stars, ye animated lamps[/deletion]
Ye moving stars that float across the glade
Ye animated lamps that midst the shade
Of ancient chesnuts in the lofty hills
of [unclear]Liugrand[/unclear].
And may not not all this varied life of man
Be but a [deletion][unclear]single[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]longer[/insertion] dream - Sometimes in dreams
We catch the feeble echoes as it were
Of other fainter dreams - In [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
The origin of [deletion]thought[/deletion] [insertion]life[/insertion] is lost. Yet power [unclear]varied[/unclear]
Reason [insertion]& thought[/insertion] & feeling how we know not
how is there aught that teases
the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] flame [insertion][unclear]from what things[/unclear] of [insertion]human[/insertion] life had [insertion]taught it[/insertion], [deletion][unclear]And[/unclear][/deletion]
So dreams have no connection - Yet the course [insertion][deletion]before[deletion] [unclear]for[/unclear][/insertion]
Of human life & human accident
