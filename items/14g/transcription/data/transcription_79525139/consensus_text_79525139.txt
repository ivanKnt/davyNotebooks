[deletion]So transient in the human mind[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]Appent[/unclear] glimmerings of light that [insertion]pass away[/insertion][/deletion]
[insertion]sometime[/insertion]
-.. [unclear]So[/unclear] glimmers in the human mind
[deletion]Some streams of light more bright [insertion]than day[/insertion][/deletion]
Streams of immortal light
That fade [deletion]xxxx[/deletion] [insertion]amidst[/insertion] its sober day
Unknown its source its essence bright
So quickly does it pass away
And leave no trace behind.
So bright your light that in the [insertion]unbroken beam[/insertion]
Of the meridian noon, it shines its [insertion]lustre scarcely dimmed[/insertion]
how your course ye bend [deletion]your[/deletion]
Ye having stars ye animated lamps
In the dark [unclear]shade[/unclear] of eternal [insertion]groves[/insertion]
That crown the [unclear]Vales of trees guard[/unclear]
and leave no trace behind
