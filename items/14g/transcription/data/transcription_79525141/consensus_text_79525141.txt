To look on Nature with a poets eye
Nursing those lofty thoughts which in the mind
Spontaneous arise & blending all their power
With images from mountain & from flood
From chesnut groves amidst the broken rocks
When the blue Lime flowers to next the wave
of foaming Serchio, or midst the odorous [unclear]heath[/unclear]
And [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] flowers
Which locks the [insertion]stream-worn[/insertion] sides of the green hills virgin
Whence rise in [deletion][unclear]mountain xxxx[/unclear] & mountain[/deletion]
Thy limpid waves & mountain [insertion]purity[/insertion] Tiber
Not protected yet, by mixture with
the lowland muddy rills
[unclear]xxx[/unclear] lodged with the rivers of the plains
When then murmerest by of ancient [unclear]Saturn[/unclear]
[unclear]Wasting[/unclear] the falling walls of the imperial city.
[unclear]Begin ban[/unclear] the times of heroes & the moments
And records of the generations past. -
It will then pass to that cloud covered hill
Where [unclear]marble[/unclear]rocks are cloathed with
brightest [deletion]verdure[deletion] green
Where Flora reigns in mountain majesty
There a thousand flowers of [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]unknown[/insertion] hues
sweets [deletion]& virtues[/deletion]
Scent the [insertion]cool[/insertion] air rarely by human breath
inhaled
