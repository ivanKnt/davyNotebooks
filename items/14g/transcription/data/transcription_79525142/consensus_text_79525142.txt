But which the wild [unclear]tree[/unclear] knows
& ever haunts. -
[deletion]And[/deletion] whence descends your balmy influence

Of ancient Appencia whose source
Hygeia loves, & midst the coolness
Of the mountain [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] & nearer the shade
of chesnuts whose time worn trunks produce
Their age of other centuries. -
