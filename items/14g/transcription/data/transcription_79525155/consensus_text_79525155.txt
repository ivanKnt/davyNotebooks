Mourn, Scotland, mourn: for [deletion]xxxx[/deletion] from [insertion]thy glorious land[/insertion]
Famed for heroic virtue & the strength
Of manly intellect & noble song
Never sprung forth two loftier plants
Than those thy latest dead
[unclear]Kept[/unclear] by times winter in their mortal [insertion]mould[/insertion]
But in their fall around them [insertion]scattering flowers & seeds[/insertion]
Of immortality /_Heroes Sages Bards
The ancient world has had that [insertion]might with thine[/insertion]
Compete, And those clear streams
That flow from [unclear]Helicons[/unclear] & old [insertion][unclear]Velian[/unclear] snows[/insertion]
Have had their murmurs [deletion]mingled[/deletion] [insertion]mixed with music [insertion]sweet[/insertion][/insertion]
