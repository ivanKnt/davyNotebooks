It is scarcely possible to adopt the
idea of the secondary strata being
formed by fire: for the degree of heat
necessary to agglutinate siliceous sandstone
must have been sufficient to have
condensed perfectly fluid carbonate of
of lime & the regular manner in
which strata of flints were deposited
is incompatible with the idea
that they were injected by an explosive
force amongst chalk or limestone
strata. -
