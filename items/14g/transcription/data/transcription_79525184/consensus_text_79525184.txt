which might be supposed to be produced
by an elevation of a part of the
american continent from the depths
of the ocean & of imagining
a great force of explosion it is
easy to imagine a velocity & a power
[deletion][unclear]xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] in the wave sufficient
to produce all the effects
which are observed
This is the argument in favour
of the first supposition that partial
operations of the same kind
often occur. - When the island
of Santorini was raised by volcanic
explosions the waves rose upon
the neighbor. &c c - so high
& such an effect here Is
produced by such a cause -
