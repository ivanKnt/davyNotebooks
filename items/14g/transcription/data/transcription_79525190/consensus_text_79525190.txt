When we consider the monuments
of the glory or the vanity of
Men & see them decay
like the beings that have
formed them, When we
know that nothing on this
earth produced by human
art or marked by
human memorial has an
existence more than 50
times those of [deletion]the[/deletion] a
generation of Men, we
are naturally led to
consider the causes
of this constant decay
