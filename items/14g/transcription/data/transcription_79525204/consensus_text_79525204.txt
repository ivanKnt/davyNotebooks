The analogy that I established long ago
in my researches on the decomposition
of the alkalies earths & the acids not
before decomposed between the silicious
& borasic bases & the facts pointed out
by M. M. Smithson Berzelius & others
entitle silica in its chemical powers
to be classed as an acid & it seems
extremely probable that the oxide of
iron existed in solution with the silica
& was deposited with it in consequence
of the cooling of the water
If this explanation be admitted it
will apply to the solution of some diffi
