Though the oxide of iron when collected is
a peroxide yet it is most probable that
in the water it exists in the state of black
[insertion]protoxide[/insertion] oxide but the atmospherical air in the
water after it is deposited would speedily
bring it to the condition of peroxide The
plausibility of this supposition is increa-
sed by the circumstances that tincture
of galls or triple [unclear]prossiate[/unclear]of potassa does
not change the colour of the water & that
the protoxides have in general the strongest
tendencies to combination with acids
When the deposit is taken up diffu-
sed through the water it contains no
other substance than oxide of iron & silica
but when it is collected from the bottom
of the Baths it contains likewise extra-
neous substances carbonate of Lime & sand
from decomposed rocks I satisfied myself
by exposing a quantity of water to the air
that the deposit is not produced after
the water has issued from its source
& there is every reason to believe that
the chemical changes take place in
consequence of the cooling of the water
