The thermal water of the Baths of
Lucca where its temperature is the high-
est at the Baths called the "Bagni Caldi
carries with it from its source a considera-
ble quantity of a yellowish brown deposit
having collected different specimens of this
deposit I submitted them to chemical
examination & found that they consisted
of red oxide of iron & silica Not having
an accurate balance I was not able to
determine the exact proportions but
in the statical exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that I made the
oxide of iron was in the largest quantity
& to the silica nearly as 4 to 3
That y[superscript]e[/superscript] oxide of iron & silica had been
dissolved together in the water & deposited
at the same time is very probable from
the state in which they are found. The
silica when the oxide of iron is separa-
-ted by a weak acid appears as a gelati-
-nous mass & the deposit before it is
submitted to any chemical agents is an
impalpable powder which to the magnifier
appears uniform in its nature
