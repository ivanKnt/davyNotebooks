I know that sigh was not
of love
I [unclear]Love[/unclear] that it was breathed for me
For well I know
That love like mine can never [insertion][deletion]never[/deletion] die[/insertion]
And that my sufferings must awaken [insertion]sympathy[/insertion]
[short horizontal rule] +
Spirits there are which for each other [insertion]formed[/insertion]
No human force or ties can [insertion]ever sunder[/insertion]
By the same breath of life they still are [insertion]warmed[/insertion]
[deletion]And[/deletion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Together moved[/insertion] to hope or joy or wonder
They are in harmony as are the [insertion]strings[/insertion]
[deletion]A[/deletion]Of a most exquisite & new tuned [deletion]lute[/deletion] [insertion]lyre[/insertion]
Or as the motion of the turtles wing
When murmuring soft they wisper soft desire
