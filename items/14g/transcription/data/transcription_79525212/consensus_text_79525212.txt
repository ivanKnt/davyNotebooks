I can but love that brilliant eye
Whether in quietness it lie
[deletion]Like[/deletion] As a still lake midst [insertion]mountain[/insertion] [deletion]piny[/deletion] shades
Or kindling like the Delphic maids
with [deletion]light of inspiration strong beames[/deletion] beaming
[deletion]And flashing y[superscript]e[/superscript] elegiac, &[/deletion]
[deletion]like light of sacred song[/deletion]
[deletion]More eloquent than is the tongue[/deletion]
[deletion]Flashing with[/deletion] Beaming [underline]with inspirations light[/underline]
Through tears of [insertion][Ink sketch][/insertion] holy rapture bright.
E'en when beneath that ivory font 
reposing
It seems in tranquil slumber closing
Its [deletion]power beneath[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]beams[/deletion] glory neath[/insertion] dark lids concealing
 Still, still its powers are not of
healing.
- For sleep to thee
Brings dreams to me.
- Of all I might have gained of all
that I have lost
By cruel fate & fortune crost
[Horizontal rule]
- I heard thee in [insertion]thy[/insertion] slumber breathe
a sigh
