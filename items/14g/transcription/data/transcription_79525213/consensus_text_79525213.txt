And think that life's quick troubled [insertion]stream[/insertion]
Is made more troubled by the blast. -
When touched by timid fingers weak
Know that Affections like the rose
It wounds but press its thorns they break
And all its odour sweeter flows.
When the thunder cloud is darkest
It is nearest to its fall
And the gloom though sadly markest
To no inmate of thy soul.
Passions [insertion]beams[/insertion] rays when too concentered
Raise a tempest in the mind
But by rain & clouds attempered
They leave fertility behind.
The torrent roaring from the moun- [insertion]tain[/insertion]
Which ravages a hundred fields
Conducted tranquil from its fountain
Bloom freshness, verdure, plenty yields.
