In it the statesman rules & lives
And the low multitude controuls
Fixed to the impulse that he gives
As the firm earth around its poles.
This magic light of life is thine
And what if given in excess?
It is excess of fire divine
Which reason always can repress.
Let not this gift which is from heaven
Shine as a meteors transient light
Or as the lightnings flashes given
Amidst the gloom to pain our sight.
Let it on friendships tranquil hours
A stedfast may day sunshine beam
Making a field of fruits & flowers
Such as the Bards elisian dream.
To kindness proferred kindness give
And fresher will the feeling flow
Affections offered gifts receive
And still more precious gifts bestow.
Failings forget & let the beam
Of charity on all be cast
