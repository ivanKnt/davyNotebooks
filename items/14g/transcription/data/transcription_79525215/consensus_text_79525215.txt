To -
What is there in life's stormy day
To please or cheer our sight
Or warm our cold & earthborn clay
Save feelings heavenly light.
This is the spirit which subdues
The Chaos of our mortal doom
Gives it creations loveliest hues
And kindles brightness midst the gloom
It wakens in the mothers kiss
It breathes profound in lovers sighs
Dove like upon the dark abyss
Of Life it rests & never dies.
From it the poets glories rise
Which pass beyond our human being
To things of other worlds & skies
Carrying the prophets gift of seeing,
By it the [deletion]ruddy[/deletion] [insertion]clotted[/insertion] blood that stains
The Hero's laurels glow[deletion]s[/deletion] like flame
Or kindles in the warriors veins
The never dying love of fame
