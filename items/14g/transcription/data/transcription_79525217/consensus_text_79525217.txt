Let not this gift which is from [insertion]heaven[/insertion]
Shine as a meteors transient light
Or as the lightnings flashes given
Amidst the gloom to pain our [insertion]sight.[/insertion]

A stedfast may day sunshine beam
Making a field of fruit & flowers
Such as the Bards elisian dream
To kindness professed kindness give
And fresher will the feelings flow

Affections offered gifts receive
And still more precious gifts [insertion]bestow[/insertion]
