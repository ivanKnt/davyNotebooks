When the thunder cloud is darkest
It is nearest to its fall.
And the gloom thou sadly markest
Is no inmate of th[deletion]e[/deletion]y soul
Feelings rays when too concentered
Raise a tempest in the mind
But by rain & clouds attempered
They leave fertility [underline]behind[/underline]. -
That magic charm of feelings thine
And oh regret not its excess.
Give it its attribute divine
But still subdue control repress
The torrent roaring from the mountain
Which ravages a [deletion]thousand[/deletion] [insertion]hundred[/insertion] fields
Conducted tranquil from its fountain
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Bloom, freshness verdure plenty yeilds
