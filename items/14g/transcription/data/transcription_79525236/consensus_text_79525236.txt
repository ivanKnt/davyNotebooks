- With respect to your first argument the
divisibility of the sentient principle, You
[deletion][unclear]prove[/unclear][/deletion] can no more prove it by the instance
you have brought forward than you
can prove it to be divisible by the
circumstance of an animal producing young

not prove its mortality or destructibility
That from one sentient being can be
formed two sentient beings does not demonstrate
either the creation or the annihilation
of sensation by arrangements of matter
It is contrary to all principles of sound
logic to endeavour to prove the
nullity or nonexistence of a quality
by proving that it can multiplied or
increased
