this visible universe would
Still be in being even
if there was no intellectual
notion to perceive it: but
the only reasonable supposition
is that its existence is
derived from & entirely dependent
upon mind: All that
Man can ever do in such
[insertion]enquiries is[/insertion] to give an history of his
own intellect: He supposes by
analogy that the universe will
exist when He perceives it no
more because He knows from
the experience of others that
certain sources of sensation
are common to all sentient
beings. -
