be produced by something
analogous to the harmony
of sounds perhaps a pure

which may prepare for something
still more exalted . -

of the analogy that you endeavour
to establish between dreams
& a variety of independent existences
though dreams have no
connection with each other yet
they are evidently related to
the state of our mind & organs
