deriving ideas from them moving
as it were in circles of
identical existence quitting for
a time [unclear]some trains[/unclear] to return
to others ; but always sentient
we can fix no beginning to
its operations ; we can
place no limit to them
we sometimes lose the beginning
& end of a dream & recollect
the middle of it & one
dream has little or no
connection with another; yet
we are conscious of an
infinity variety of dreams
& there is the same analogy
for believing in an infinity
of spirit existences which
must have had connections
though we can not trace
