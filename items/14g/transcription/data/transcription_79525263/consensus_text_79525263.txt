P. : As a very small part only
of the solid materials of the Globe
are useful in organized life so
in the Atmosphere the great constituent

have dwelt so much upon
& considered so much the harmony
of the system of the Globe that

P. I was about to make a
similar observation. Why could
not the whole of our planet have
been formed of compounds of the same
kind as those found in vegetables or
animals & the atmosphere have been
entirely composed of oxygene. Why could
it not have supplied nourishment
to myriad of millions of inhabitants
in the same manners as a cheshire
cheeze supplies food to mites &
of what use are its profound
rocks, its deserts of siliceous sand
