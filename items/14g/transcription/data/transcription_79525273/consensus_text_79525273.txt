- I have seen few vallies so beautiful as
that of the Flumen frigidus near
Massa.- The river issues at once from
a bed of marble alternating with
Mica shist - The mountains above
are bold craggy & precipitous
with forms infinitely varied. - The
river forms a succession of
PISA
cataracts & pools & is joined below
by a small clear stream coming from
another 1 9 7 8 Valley. The windings
of [deletion]the valley[/deletion] are so numerous
8022
that every 200 or 300 yards presents
a new mountain view; Vines, chestnut trees
walnuts [insertion]trees[/insertion] & olives on the S side of the
Hill abound
