[place]place_155|Rome[/place] - April 11. 1819.
Nothing suits this City less than
the pomp, noise & diseased action
of a court. The feeling produced
by the remains of the works
of that people which conquered
the world and which ultimately
diffused the arts and the letters
of [place]place_167|Greece[/place] from the mountains
of Imaus and [place]place_1149|Caucasus[/place] to the
wilds of Caledonia is one of
melancholy & sublimity. There
is no analogy between the nothingness
[deletion]greatness[/deletion] of modern state &
the greatness of ancient
glory. The last sovereign
who claimed the name of
Roman Emperor & who [deletion][unclear]Cont[/unclear][/deletion]
renounced that name to [unclear]purchase[/unclear]

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00004|dnp14g002pp|79525120[/page]
a dishonourable peace ought to
have no legitimate business
at [place]place_155|Rome[/place] unless to [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]console[/insertion] himself
for his own loss of power [deletion]with[/deletion] with
the decay [deletion]to nature[/deletion] of [deletion]matter[/deletion]
nations - a courtier on
the ruins of [place]place_155|Rome[/place]
is like a Butterfly
perched on the bones of
a giant - the last of the
Roman emperors
The oak - [unclear]tree[/unclear] the new
leaves & blossoms push off
the old leaves -
The [underline]purple spring[/underline] here is
a correct Epithet
& shews the richness of

ancient [place]place_097|Italy[/place] - in travelling
through the [place]place_926|Sabine[/place] country
I found even the woods
purple from the profusion
of a tree with a leaf
like the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] tree &
covered all over with
purple blossoms 
There is abundance of
a marble which seems to
me of the same kind as
[chemical]chemical_422|Rosso antico[/chemical] in the
walls of [place]place_927|Spoleto[/place] &
[place]place_564|Foligno[/place] -
About 3 miles or 4 from
[place]place_564|Foligno[/place] a fine fall

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00006|dnp14g004pp|79525122[/page]
of the river which
runs through [place]place_564|Foligno[/place]
an interrupted fall
of 800 or 1000 feet
the river of a milky bright
blueness not foul
Where will not
Man fix himself
above this Cascade 700 or
800 feet [unclear]in[/unclear] a small
home / where are
[misc]misc_226|sterlet[/misc] much more fitted 
for an Eagles nest
than a Heron neighbour

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00007|dnp14g005pp|79525123[/page]
From the manner in which
the red and yellow [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
of the Appenines are
deposited with [underline]red[/underline]
& yellow chert, I have no
doubt that they were
deposited from the same
fluid. - It would
be worth while to
try if [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] by
[deletion]heat &[/deletion] pressure will
not dissolve [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical]
as [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] does
There are quarries of red & yellow marble in
various parts of the Appenines - between [place]place_927|Spoleto[/place] & [place]place_561|Col-[line]Fiorito[/place] ... & the walls of [place]place_564|Foligno[/place] contain pieces

The valley of [place]place_564|Foligno[/place]
is [underline]richer[/underline] as far as agriculture
produce can go & at
this season, the [nonenglish]nonenglish_360|Ver[line]purpureus[/nonenglish] was produced by

The Journey from [place]place_155|Rome[/place]

is not worth the [unclear]labour[/unclear]
the inconviences & the
[unclear][nonenglish]nonenglish_177|Vetturino[/nonenglish][/unclear] slowness – [place]place_956|The[line]Valley of Rieti[/place] was
rich, but it would
be much richer on
approaching to [chemical]chemical_422|Rosso antico[/chemical]
but a still finer kind
is found in the [unclear]Marca [place]place_929|Bresciana[/place][/unclear] on the borders of
the [place]place_551|Lago di Garda[/place] - between [place]place_726|Desensano[/place] &

The end of May the
Snow clad mountains above
from which the [place]place_848|Velino[/place]
rises are bold & rugged
but the hills want
wood & the green freshness
of [place]place_196|Styria[/place] or [place]place_198|Switzerland[/place]
& the rock they present
is not [unclear]sufficiently[/unclear] [deletion]bold[/deletion] precipitous
or mighty
to add to the sublimity
of the scene - it gives 
the idea of barreness &
not of boldness - They
talked of trouts in the
[place]place_848|Velino[/place] I saw none rise
[place]place_1151|Pesciara[/place], the stones on the side of the 
great road many of them rival the [chemical]chemical_422|Rosso antico[/chemical]

nor could I see any in
clear water that flows
in above [place]place_955|Rieti[/place]
In the [place]place_1386|Farfa[/place]
rapid stream not more
than 30 miles from [place]place_155|Rome[/place]
I saw two [unclear]trouts[/unclear] & I
have no doubt that
Fly fishing might be successfully
[unclear]xxxx[/unclear] here & perhaps
higher up than [unclear][place]place_955|Rieti[/place][/unclear] the [place]place_848|Velino[/place]

I saw more but I hunted them
too little for a fair trial
at [place]place_1152|Poggio S[superscript]t[/superscript] Lorenzo[/place]
a Starna was brought
in which appeared to me
[unclear]2[/unclear] as large as our Partridge
it was red behind the ear
[unclear]2h[/unclear] is it a different species
or are both the [unclear]Cotaria[/unclear]
& [misc]misc_357|Starna[/misc], the grey & red

large varieties
All the beauty & sublimity
of the Valley between
[place]place_955|Rieti[/place] & [place]place_565|Terni[/place] may

be seen by going 3 or
4 miles above the fall
& looking at the lake
from the right hand.
From [place]place_564|Foligno[/place] to
Col. fiorito as the well
known road to Loreto - 
I had passed it before
on my road from Loreto
to [place]place_155|Rome[/place] & was struck
with its [unclear]cacciatory[/unclear] aspect
The account given by a

Roman Sportsman induced me
to pay it [underline]another visit[/underline]
I found myself for 4 [underline]nights[/underline]
in this [place]place_530|Appenine[/place] [underline]situation[/underline]
- Its elevation is considerable
I should conceive at least
3000 feet above the sea
Snow was upon the hills
surrounding it & the thermeter
stood at 10 or 12 [insertion]at 8 o'Clock[/insertion] & did
not rise at noon to more than
13 or 14 - the meadows
surrounding the two or
three small lakes are

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00014|dnp14g012pp|79525130[/page]
beautifully green & [unclear]Have[/unclear]
[misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] & various
other borers & waders
rest in their passage from
the South to the north - 
I had a very good
opportunity of observing the
habits of the Solitary [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc]
or Pitzardine of the 
[underline]Italians[/underline] - They
arrive here in Flocks
of sometimes 3, 4 or 5
or 10 or 12 - I found

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00015|dnp14g013pp|79525131[/page]
13
them in parties of 3 4 or 5
They select spots in which
the grass is sufficiently long
to hide them & which
are covered with fresh
water - They are easily
shot when they first arrive
but after being fired at
or raised three or
4 times they become
wild & run or rise
at considerable distances
The smallest animal &

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00016|dnp14g014pp|79525132[/page]
which I suppose to be
the [chemical]chemical_397|shale[/chemical] has darker
legs & I find are with
a little red behind the
ear, the organ
of hearing is very large
they run when
they hear a noise
& nothing contributes so
much to spoil the
[unclear]shots[/unclear] as talking to the
dogs - they differ
from the common [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc]

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00017|dnp14g015pp|79525133[/page]

in weighing nearly twice as
much, in having a [underline]spotted[/underline]
& red & white breast -
a [underline]shorter beak[/underline] - & white
feathers in the [underline]tail[/underline].
 The time of their passage
in [place]place_097|Italy[/place] is between the
15 of March & the
20 or 25 of April -
I killed one on March
19 near [place]place_155|Rome[/place] & I
killed ten at [place]place_561|Col.[line]Fiorito[/place] 15 April & again

The 19 [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] in a [unclear]lapse[/unclear] of

At least 6 or 7 different
species of Waterfowl migrate
A large black one which I
shot in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript] in the [unclear]Meranne[/unclear]
of [place]place_931|Venice[/place] - the one well
known in [place]place_121|England[/place], the spotted
one found in winter in [place]place_121|England[/place]
occasionally & abundant in [place]place_097|Italy[/place]
- A small one very like it in colour
but with a green beak migrating
in the spring through [place]place_097|Italy[/place]

where the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Lark species
I  found at, [place]place_561|Col Fiorito[/place]. -
- It is very remarkable
that the swifts which migrate
through [place]place_097|Italy[/place] in April &
those that remain at
[place]place_561|Col Fiorito[/place] do not pipe
& never breed; are they
not probably  males or .

imperfect, they are
fat & larger than the
swifts which precede
them - some of them
are as large as [nonenglish]nonenglish_201|pizardone[/nonenglish]
I find them in pairs
however -
The [unclear]pitzardino[/unclear] partakes of
the habits of the [misc]misc_418|Woodcock[/misc]
& the [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc] when fired

all the experiments, [insertion]if they could be so called[/insertion] which He had

by setting fire to small [insertion]detached[/insertion] streams

them or one of them by causing
the air deteriorated by the combustion

& that His plan for preserving

nothing to do with a safety

an idea of burning the

flame from passing into -
It appears likewise in
actual trial, that He made
his tube at the suggestion
of a Foreman half an inch
in diameter & furnished
it with a slider at the

It is scarcely possible to adopt the

In favour of the [deletion]second[/deletion] proposition
it can only be argued that
it may be made to account
for the phaenomena but we
have nothing in the history of
the world to shew that comets
have ever had the least
influence upon our [underline]tides[/underline]
& the matter of which they
are composed seems so extremely
sure that we can hardly
estimate their relations to
gravity & [deletion]to combine[/deletion]
various hypotheses [deletion]to account[/deletion]
[deletion]for is very soon[/deletion] must be

probability to this view of the

[page]70|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00070|dnp14g066pp|79525184[/page]
which might be supposed to be produced
by an elevation of a part of the
american continent from the depths
of the ocean & of imagining
a great force of explosion it is
easy to imagine a velocity & a power
[deletion][unclear]xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] in the wave sufficient
to produce all the effects
which are observed
This is the argument in favour
of the first supposition that partial
operations of the same kind
often occur. - When the island
of Santorini was raised by volcanic
explosions the waves rose upon
the neighbor. &c c - so high
& such an effect here Is
produced by such a cause -

rotation -
A third hypothesis might be
invented namely that the
effect might have been produced
by the fall of an immense
[unclear]solid[/unclear] or meteoric stone
in the great depths of
the ocean: but this supposition
is much too vague & improbable
to arrest our attention for
a moment. -
[ink sketches of two faces in profile]
Of the two most obvious suppositions
the first requires a cause inherent in
the oeconomy of the globe & is undoubtedly
to be preferred supposing it [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]explains the[/insertion]
phaenomena with the same facility.
To have a wave of 8 or 10 thousand
feet high would not require
more powerful agency than that

[page]72|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00072|dnp14g068pp|79525186[/page]
for these circumstances except by
the supposition that waves or
currents from the ocean having
with very great force & velocity
passed over our land. & there
are two hypothetical causes
by which they may be imagined
to be produced. -
One by the sudden elevation
of great masses of land in
the depths of the ocean in
consequence of a volcanic explosion
or eruption -
The other by the [insertion]near[/insertion] approach of
a comet which by attracting
the waters to a height of
8 or 10000 feet caused them
as it were to revolve round
the earth with a velocity
equal to that of its diurnal

- There Rocks & fragments of

of them destroyed & carried off

It is impossible to account

In opposition to this influence
of water, the effect of fire acting
beneath the surface is to raise
new land & new mountains -
Many of the high[deletion]est[/deletion] elevations of
the old world & [deletion]the[/deletion] almost all
the highest of the new world
are volcanic & in comparing the
two species of agencies they appear as it
were in equilibria & [deletion][unclear]equally[/unclear][/deletion] fitted to produce
the harmony of the existing system. -
But independently of the agency of
water to which I have referred, there
has been another agency of a much
more violent kind & which must have
been produced by causes that do
not now operate [insertion]or that do not operate to the same extent[/insertion] - In examining
our soils & the surface of

water worn [deletion]p[/deletion] pebbles & stones that must

In the phaenomena of the present changes of the

the great causes of change, & these agencies

[underline]On the structure[/underline] of [underline]the Solid[/underline]
[underline]parts of the Globe.[/underline]
[underline]or Geology.[/underline]
In considering the exterior of the Globe in its
relation to organized life, it appears wonderfully
fitted for all the objects of an habitable world
Delightful to the eye by the almost infinit[deletion]ity[/deletion]e
variety of its forms it fills the imagination
by the wonderful diversity of their combinations

that the iron was dissolved by [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
but there is no [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] in this water
& on evaporating a large quantity of the
water & washing out the sulphates &

of a substance exactly the same as

when it arrives within the influence of
the atmosphere & that its temperature
which is 130°[superscript]F[/superscript] where it issues from the
ground is much higher in the interior &
probably far above that of boiling water
The analogy that I established long ago
in my researches on the decomposition
of the alkalies earths & the acids not
before decomposed between the [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical]
& borasic bases & the facts pointed out
by [person]person_611|M. M. Smithson[/person] [person]person_349|Berzelius[/person] & others
entitle [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical] in its chemical powers
to be classed as an acid & it seems
extremely probable that the oxide of
iron existed in solution with the [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical]
& was deposited with it in consequence
of the cooling of the water
If this explanation be admitted it
will apply to the solution of some diffi
-culties which have occurred with respect
to the causes of the existence of [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical]
in mineral waters [person]person_777|Signore Battista Te-[line]-ssandori[/person] had already detected a minute
quantity of [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical] in the

[page]91|MS-DAVY-11407-000-00091|dnp14g087pp|79525205[/page]
Though the [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] when collected is
a peroxide yet it is most probable that
in the water it exists in the state of black
[insertion]protoxide[/insertion] oxide but the [chemical]chemical_149|atmospherical air[/chemical] in the
water after it is deposited would speedily
bring it to the condition of peroxide The
plausibility of this supposition is increa-
sed by the circumstances that tincture
of galls or triple [chemical]chemical_225|prossiate of potassa[/chemical] does
not change the colour of the water & that
the protoxides have in general the strongest
tendencies to combination with acids
When the deposit is taken up diffu-
sed through the water it contains no
other substance than [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical]
but when it is collected from the bottom
of the Baths it contains likewise extra-
neous substances [chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical] & sand
from decomposed rocks I satisfied myself
by exposing a quantity of water to the air
that the deposit is not produced after
the water has issued from its source
& there is every reason to believe that
the chemical changes take place in
consequence of the cooling of the water

The thermal water of the [place]place_952|Baths of[line]Lucca[/place] where its temperature is the high-
est at the Baths called the "[place]place_767|Bagni Caldi[/place]
carries with it from its source a considera-
ble quantity of a yellowish brown deposit
having collected different specimens of this
deposit I submitted them to chemical
examination & found that they consisted
of [chemical]chemical_166|red oxide of iron[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical] Not having
an accurate balance I was not able to
determine the exact proportions but
in the statical exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that I made the
[chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] was in the largest quantity
& to the [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical] nearly as 4 to 3
That y[superscript]e[/superscript] [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical] had been
dissolved together in the water & deposited
at the same time is very probable from
the state in which they are found. The
[chemical]chemical_034|silica[/chemical] when the [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] is separa-
-ted by a weak acid appears as a gelati-
-nous mass & the deposit before it is
submitted to any chemical agents is an
impalpable powder which to the magnifier
appears uniform in its nature
