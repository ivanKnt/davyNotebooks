Rome - April 11. 1819.
Nothing suits this City less than
the pomp, noise & diseased activity
of a court. The feeling produced
by the remains of the works
of that people which conquered
the world and which ultimately
diffused the arts and the letters
of Greece from the mountains
of Taurus and Caucasus to the
wilds of Caledonia is one of
melancholy &sublimity. There
is no analogy between the nothingness
[deletion]greatness[/deletion] of modern state &
the greatness of ancient
The last sovereign

who claimed the name of
Roman Emperor & who [deletion][unclear]Cont[/unclear][/deletion]

ancient Italy - in travelling
through the Sabine country
I found even the woods
purple from the profusion
of a tree with a leaf
like the lime tree &
covered all over with
purple blossoms 
There is abundance of
a marble which seems to
be of the same kind as
Rosso antico in the
walls of Spoleto &
Poligno -
About 3 miles or 4 from
Foligno a fine fall

[page]6||dnp14g004pp|79525122[/page]

runs through Foligno

from the manner in which
the red and yellow limestone
of the Appenines is
deposited with [underline]red[/underline]
& yellow chert, I have no
doubt that they were
deposited from the same
flood. - It would
be worth while to
try if carbonic acid by
[deletion]heat &[/deletion] prefer will
not dissolve silica
as muriatic acid does
There are quarries of red & yellow marsh in
various parts of the Appenines - between Spoleto & Col-
Fiorito ... & the walls of Foligno contain pieces

The valley of Foligno
is [underline]richer[/underline] as far as agriculture

The end of May the
Snow clad mountains above
from which the Velino
rises are bold & rugged
but the hills want
wood & the green freshness
of Styria or Switzerland
& the rock they present
is not [unclear]sufficiently[/unclear] [deletion]bold[/deletion] precipitous
or mighty
to add to the sublimity
of the scene - it gives 
the idea of barreness &
not of boldness - They
talked of trouts in the

From Foligno to
Col. fiorito as the well

I had passed it before
on my road from Loreto

to pay it [underline]another visit[/underline]
I found myself for 4 [underline]nights[/underline]
in this appenine [underline]situation[/underline]
- Its elevation is considerable
I should conceive at least
3000 feet above the sea
Snow was upon the hills
surrounding it & the thermeter
stood at 10 or 12 [insertion]at 8 o'Clock[/insertion] & did
not rise at noon to more than
13 or 14 - the meadows
surrounding the two or
three small lakes are

beautifully green & [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]
Snipes & various
other borers & waders
rest in their passage from
the South to the north - 
I had a very good
opportunity of observing the
habits of the Solitary snipe
or Pitzardine of the 
[underline]Italians[/underline] - They
arrive here in Flocks
of sometimes 3, 4 or 5
or 10 or 12 - I found

There in parties of 3 4 or 5
They select parts in which
the grass is sufficiently long
to hide them & which
are covered with fresh
water - They are easily
shot when they first arrive
but after being fired at
or scared three or
4 times they become
wild & run or rise
at considerable distances
The smallest animal &

[page]16||dnp14g014pp|79525132[/page]
then disappears to be
the shale has darker
legs & I find are with
a little red behind the
ear, the organ
of hearing is very large
they run when
they hear a noise
& nothing contributes so
much to spoil the

from the common snipe

much, in having a [underline]spotted[/underline]

a [underline]shorter beak[/underline] - & white
feathers in the [underline]tail[/underline].
 The time of their passage
in Italy is between the
15 of March & the
20 or 26 of April -

killed ten at the Col.

At least 6 or 7 different

A large black one which I
shot in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript] in the [unclear]Meranne[/unclear]
of Venice - the one with
[unclear]known[/unclear] in England, the spotted
one found in winter in England
Variously & abundant in Italy
- A small one very like it in colour
but with a green beak migrating
in the spring through Italy

one with a red eye & a grey

or a small yellowish rail with
a grey eye & yellow beak

I  found at, Col Fiorito. -
- It is very remarkable
that the swifts which migrate
through Italy in April &
those that remain at
Col Fiorito do not pipe

swifts which precede
them - some of them
is as large as Pizardone
I find them in pairs
however -
The [unclear]pitzardino[/unclear] partakes of
the habits of the woodcock
& the snipe when fired
at two or three times hides

[underline]It is now nearly three years since a[/underline]
[underline][deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] claim was set up by[/underline]
[insertion][deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] W[superscript]m[/superscript] Brandling[/deletion][/insertion]
[underline]for a mechanic in the employment[/underline]
[underline]of [deletion]Lord St[/deletion] Lord Strathmore Sir[/underline]
Thomas Liddel & Co; as to the
discussion [insertion]& application[/insertion] of the principle of
security in the safety lamp; about
[insertion][unclear]or com[/unclear][/insertion] [deletion]& the application of it[/deletion] or
& before the [deletion][unclear]same[/unclear][/deletion] time that
Sir Humphry Davys discover[deletion]y[/deletion]ies on
Flame were [deletion]publi[/deletion] made known
or published. - This claim
as it was never urged till
many months after the safety
lamp of Sir Humphry Davy
was in use & as it was
for a long time
only supported by [insertion]anonymous[/insertion] publications
which contained gross falshoods
or misrepresentations met

[page]30||dnp14g028pp|79525144[/page]
with no attention [insertion]either[/insertion], from
Sir H Davy or any
scientific men nor did
it [deletion]need[/deletion] [insertion]appear before[/insertion] the public eye
in any [deletion][unclear]leng[/unclear][/deletion] distinct
from this the year
1818 When a meeting

[person_358][deletion]Brandling[/deletion][/person_358] [insertion]Newcastle Persons[/insertion] & [deletion]Some[/deletion] other
Persons for the purpose
of rewarding the pretended
Discoverer & some
hundreds of pounds were
subscribed on the occasion.
This led to [deletion]an[/deletion]a [insertion]scientific[/insertion] investigation
of his claims when
they were formally denied
by Sir H Davy himself

[page]31||dnp14g029pp|79525145[/page]

by some [deletion]scientific[/deletion] of the
most distinguished scientific
men in England by whom
they were examined &
by the great Body of

[deletion]by[/deletion] from some of the subscribers
calling themselves a committee
from which combined with
[deletion]statements[/deletion] [insertion]publications[/insertion] [deletion]made by[/deletion] of the
said Mechanic whose name
is Stevenson or by the person
time of the
and in understanding of law
element of experts

[page]32||dnp14g030pp|79525146[/page]
who has been his advocate
whose name is [person_358]Brandling[/person_358]
is easy to shew the
cause of the mistake
of these well intentioned but
unscientific persons who have
been his Benefactors.
It appears evident from
the statements of this person
himself & of workmen
in the same mine that
all the experiments, [insertion]if they could be so called[/insertion] which He had
ever made previous to the
time when Sir H Davy
began his researches were
by setting fire to small [insertion]detached[/insertion] streams
of firedamp or carburetted
Hydrogene in the mine & extinguishing

[page]33||dnp14g031pp|79525147[/page]
31
them or one of them by causing
the air deteriorated by the combustion
of candles to pass upon them
& that this plan for preserving
the lives of the miners had
nothing to do with a safety
lamp but [deletion]depended[/deletion] [insertion]was founded[/insertion] upon
an idea of burning the
firedamp [insertion]or carburetted hydrogene from large [unclear]blowns[/unclear][/insertion] in such detached portions
portions; & that the
apparatus which He imagined
for this purpose consisted
of a tube of 1/4 of inch
in diameter [deletion]but whi[/deletion]
[deletion]& a large conical glass[/deletion]
with a wick round it to
set fire to [insertion]a detached part of[/insertion] the stream of
gas & a conical glass
open at the top & so
[unclear]this[/unclear] as to prevent the

[page]34||dnp14g032pp|79525148[/page]
flame from passing into -
It appears likewise in
actual trial, that He made
his tube at the suggestion
of a Foreman half an inch
in diameter & furnished
it with a slider at the
bottom to regulated the
quantity of gas admitted-  .
His object evidently was
to separate a [insertion]small[/insertion] part or
to detach a portion
of gas as it expired
from a blower & to
burn it as a gass
light - [deletion]In[/deletion] The exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
that he made with his
lamp as detailed by witnesses

[page]35||dnp14g033pp|79525149[/page]
33
prove this He went up to
a blower ie to a stream
of fire damp from [underline]the windward[/underline]
& put it into the stream
of gas a few inches only
from where it issued, when
[underline]the flame enlarged[/underline] & then
went out - He afterwards
tried three [insertion]smaller[/insertion] tubes with
[underline]the same[/underline] results & finding
that He could not
burn fire damp in this
way, & suspecting that
[deletion]it[/deletion]if [deletion]was owing to[/deletion] [insertion]He could [unclear]yet rid[/unclear][/insertion] the
[deletion]accumulation of[/deletion] [insertion]of the[/insertion] burnt
air . as He expresses himself
He should [insertion]be able to succeed if[/insertion] [deletion]burn[/deletion]
in this exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]; - He placed

[page]36||dnp14g034pp|79525150[/page]
a [underline]canal[/underline] with holes in it around
his wick; -
It is perfectly evident that
when his trials were directed
to burn the gas from [insertion]large[/insertion] blowers
by means of tubes [insertion]as in the single gass light burner or by means of [unclear]canals[/unclear] with holes as in this [unclear]compound[/unclear] one[/insertion] ie to
make of them smaller blowers
& that He failed from
being ignorant of the necessity
of fresh air to combustion
- But his lamps went
out in a [deletion]stream[/deletion] [insertion]Atmosphere[/insertion] of carburetted
hydrogene without inflaming
it: [deletion]& the[/deletion] which every
lamp will do in which there
is only a limited circulation
of air & in which y[superscript]e[/superscript] [deletion]the[/deletion] carburetted

[page]37||dnp14g035pp|79525151[/page]
35
hydrogene enters [deletion]so[/deletion] slowly -
Hence he thought proper
to identi[deletion]t[/deletion]fy this unsuccessf[deletion]l[/deletion]ul
[deletion]application[/deletion] attempts to burn
firedamp damp [insertion]without air[/insertion] with Sir H Davys
[underline]extinction[/underline] of explosion or
[underline]flame by y[superscript]e[/superscript] cooling effects[/underline] of
[underline]metallic surfaces[/underline].
That this is the simple
statement of the case
is [insertion]easily[/insertion] proved [deletion]by exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] [unclear]Whoever[/unclear]
will try any two of
his first three inventions
in an explosive atmosphere
[deletion]will find that whenever a light will[/deletion]
[insertion]burn in [unclear]them[/unclear][/insertion] [deletion]will find that[/deletion] they instantly
fire it

[page]38||dnp14g036pp|79525152[/page]
Even his lamp shewn as
a safety lamp at Newcastle
long after Sir H Davys principal
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were known there will
do this -
The fact is that the ignorance
of all the persons concerned in
this business was so great
that they did not even know
the difference between an
explosive mixture of firedamp
& pure fire damp &
thought - they had proved the
safety of a lamp by extinguishing
flame in it by letting

[page]39||dnp14g037pp|79525153[/page]
37
firedamp pass into it from
a bladder filled with it
opened below it -
It is clear that Stevenson's plan
as expressed by his friend & patron
[person_358]Brandling[/person_358] was that of burning
3.5
[underline]7[/underline]
[underline]2.45[/underline]
the firedamp in small
detached portions ie He having
found that small detached

Streams of fire damp might be
[underline]4[/underline]
set fire to in the mine
)[underline]10. 0[/underline]
& that air deteriorated by combustion
[deletion]prevented[/deletion] extinguished flame thought
that He might separate a
large blower into small streams
of fire damp & thus consume it
at its origin & prevent it from forming

It is scarcely possible to adopt the
idea of the secondary strata being
formed by fire: for the degree of heat
necessary to agglutinate siliceous sandstone
must have been sufficient to have
condensed perfectly fluid carbonate of
of lime & the regular manner in
which strata of flints were deposited
is incompatible with the idea
that they were injected by an explosive
force amongst chalk or limestone
strata. -

this is the case in a remarkable

It is known that when in a

one of the salts is introduced, this begins
to chrystallise first,  Quere is this the case?
so that the chrystalline matter found
cementing together deposits of the same nature
may owe its existence to this cause
But the flints [deletion][unclear]& xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] which occur [deletion]together[/deletion] [insertion]in chalk[/insertion]

can hardly be doubted for they sometimes

It may seem incompatible with

that they were formed at a time
when the only species of animal

[deletion]& at a period when water covered[/deletion]
[deletion]almost the whole of its surface[/deletion]

[deletion]of islands covered with vegetable[/deletion]

the existence of coal, if it was
found only in [unclear]basins[/unclear] or strata
by supposing land covered with
vegetable matter formed by an
irruption of the ocean, but in
this case these could be only one
[deletion]occurrence[/deletion] stratum on the same
surface whereas often 10 . 15 or 20
different [insertion]strata[/insertion] & states of coal are found

Formations of coal are found
at great depth under strata of

which contain the remains of land
plants & those remains are sometimes
mixed with shells [insertion]& the bones of[/insertion] fishes - It is
not possible to doubt then that
these [deletion]coals[/deletion] carbonaceous results were
produced by vegetable matter, [deletion]which[/deletion]
[deletion]had been covered by[/deletion] & it is consequently
neccessary to suppose [insertion]either[/insertion] [deletion]a change of[/deletion]

& that the bed of the ocean

from formed at a time when the vegetable matter of

Whilst the record allowing the data
explains the phenomena [insertion]of consolidation[/insertion] with greater
facility: for it is much more
easy to suppose carbonate of lime
& silica deposition [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] in a
chrystalline state from water [deletion]in which[/deletion]

up for the smallness of the portion
dissolved, than to [deletion]suppo[/deletion] [insertion]imagine[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] fire capable
of fusing them operating upon a
great scale at the bottom of
the ocean. -
In a globe constituted like ours
all solution or fluidity must be
more or less dependent upon temperature
& water which forms so large a
proportion of its exterior [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] crust can
never be excluded from a share in producing
the chemical changes which have
[deletion]been produced[/deletion] [insertion]occured[/insertion] upon it & in following
the strictest inductive reasoning, it

make a system which if [insertion]a name be[/insertion] [deletion]it be necessary[/deletion]

which in the course of ages has been

been [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] consolidated by the
action of fire & raised by the
force of fire - [deletion]In the Huttonian[/deletion]
[deletion]system it is supposed[/deletion] acting
in the interior parts of the globe.
In the Neptunian hypothesis it
is supposed that the [underline]ocean contains[/underline]
in solution the different [underline]chrystaline[/underline]

they were deposited gradually & at the

the ocean was peopled with
living beings & [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] its shores covered

- In considering the comparative
merits of these two hypotheses, the first
appears most philosophical & has the
merit of affording a view of
the system of the globe in which
the principles of decay & renovation

[page]60||dnp14g056pp|79525174[/page]
fishes are found in different strata
& these strata are often arranged

[deletion]as if life[/deletion] & the [deletion]beings are[/deletion] [insertion]remains[/insertion]

the time the consolidation

- For explaining the formation
of these strata two hypotheses
have been invented. The
one the Huttonian or [underline]plutonic[/underline]

- In the first it is supposed that

In favour of the [deletion]second[/deletion] proposition
it can only be argued that
it may be made to account
for the phaenomena but we
have nothing in the history of

have ever had the least
influence upon our [underline]tides[/underline]

[deletion]for is very soon[/deletion] must be
must be limited to give
probability to this view of the

[page]70||dnp14g066pp|79525184[/page]
which might be supposed to be produced
by an elevation of a part of the
american continent from the depths
of the ocean & of imagining
a great force of explosion it is
easy to imagine a velocity & a power
[deletion][unclear]xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] in the wave sufficient
to produce all the effects
which are observed
This is the argument in favour
of the first supposition that partial
operations of the same kind
often occur. - When the island
of Santorini was raised by volcanic
explosions the waves rose upon
the neighbor. &c c - so high
& such an effect here Is
produced by such a cause -

[page]71||dnp14g067pp|79525185[/page]

rotation -
A third hypothesis might be
invented namely that the
effect might have been produced
by the fall of an immense
[unclear]solid[/unclear] or meteoric stone
in the great depths of
the ocean: but this supposition
is much too vague & improbable
to arrest our attention [/unclear] for
a moment. -
[ink sketches of two faces in profile]
Of the two most obvious suppositions
the first requires a cause inherent in
the oeconomy of the globe & is undoubtedly
to be preferred supposing it [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]explains the[/insertion]
phaenomena with the same facility.
To have a wave of 8 or 10 thousand
feet high would not require
more powerful agency than that

[page]72||dnp14g068pp|79525186[/page]
for these circumstances except by
the supposition that waves or
currents from the ocean having
with very great force & velocity
passed over our land. & there
are two hypothetical causes
by which they may be imagined
to be produced. -
One by the sudden elevation
of great masses of land in
the depths of the ocean in
consequence of a volcanic explosion
or eruption -
The other by the [insertion]near[/insertion] approach of
a comet which by attracting
the waters to a height of
8 or 10000 feet caused them
as it were to revolve round
the earth with a velocity
equal to that of its diurnal

In opposition to this influence
of water, the effect of fire acting
beneath the surface is to raise
new land & new mountains -
Many of the high[deletion]est[/deletion] elevations of
the old world & [deletion]the[/deletion] almost all
the highest of the new world
are volcanic & in comparing the
two species of agencies they appear as it
were in equilibria & [deletion][unclear]equally[/unclear][/deletion] fitted to produce
the harmony of the existing system. -
But independently of the agency of
water to which I have referred, there
has been another agency of a much
more violent kind & which must have
been produced by causes that do
not now operate [insertion]or that do not operate to the same extent[/insertion] - In examining
our soils & the surface of
our lands & mountains, we find
water worn [deletion]p[/deletion] pebbles & stones that must

when it arrives within the influence of
the atmosphere & that its temperature
which is 130°[superscript]F[/superscript] where it issues from the
ground is much higher in the interior &
probably far above that of boiling water
The analogy that I established long ago
in my researches on the decomposition
of the alkalies earths & the acids not
before decomposed between the silicious
& borasic bases & the facts pointed out
by M. M. Smithson Berzelius & others
entitle silica in its chemical powers
to be classed as an acid & it seems
extremely probable that the oxide of
iron existed in solution with the silica
& was deposited with it in consequence
of the cooling of the water
If this explanation be admitted it
will apply to the solution of some diffi
-culties which have occurred with respect
to the causes of the existence of oxide of iron
in mineral waters Signore Battista Te-
-ssandori had already detected a minute
quantity of oxide of iron & silica in the

[page]91||dnp14g087pp|79525205[/page]
Though the oxide of iron when collected is
a peroxide yet it is most probable that
in the water it exists in the state of black
[insertion]protoxide[/insertion] oxide but the atmospherical air in the
water after it is deposited would speedily
bring it to the condition of peroxide The
plausibility of this supposition is increa-
sed by the circumstances that tincture
of galls or triple [unclear]prossiate[/unclear]of potassa does
not change the colour of the water & that
the protoxides have in general the strongest
tendencies to combination with acids
When the deposit is taken up diffu-
sed through the water it contains no
other substance than oxide of iron & silica
but when it is collected from the bottom
of the Baths it contains likewise extra-
neous substances carbonate of Lime & sand
from decomposed rocks I satisfied myself
by exposing a quantity of water to the air
that the deposit is not produced after
the water has issued from its source
& there is every reason to believe that
the chemical changes take place in
consequence of the cooling of the water

The thermal water of the Baths of
Lucca where its temperature is the high-
est at the Baths called the "Bagni Caldi
carries with it from its source a considera-
ble quantity of a yellowish brown deposit
having collected different specimens of this
deposit I submitted them to chemical
examination & found that they consisted
of red oxide of iron & silica Not having
an accurate balance I was not able to
determine the exact proportions but
in the statical exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that I made the
oxide of iron was in the largest quantity
& to the silica nearly as 4 to 3
That y[superscript]e[/superscript] oxide of iron & silica had been
dissolved together in the water & deposited
at the same time is very probable from
the state in which they are found. The
silica when the oxide of iron is separa-
-ted by a weak acid appears as a gelati-
-nous mass & the deposit before it is
submitted to any chemical agents is an
impalpable powder which to the magnifier
appears uniform in its nature
