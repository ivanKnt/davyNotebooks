            <note>Born in Massachusetts, he served in the British and Bavarian armies. Knighted by George III in 1787, the Elector of Bavaria created him Reichsgraf von Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire in 1792. His appointment in the late 1790s as Bavarian ambassador to London created a minor diplomatic incident, during which he helped establish and manage the Royal Institution, in the course of which he appointed Davy to lecture there. Later he married Lavoisier's widow and lived unhappily ever after. FRSL.</note>

When this substance is "heated very strongly", it produces "pure potash or potassa" (pp. 323-324).</p>
