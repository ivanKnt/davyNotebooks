A Change of scene. The base of Vesuvius<lb/>
A: The violence of the eruption is now over; tho clouds<lb/>
still cover the top of the mountain yet I think<lb/>
we can ascend to the spot from whence the lava<lb/>
issues as from a fountain and what a magnificent<lb/>
sight is this river of fire nearly half a mile in<lb/>
length &amp; in some places 50 yards broad.<lb/>
P: It would be still more magnificent in the night<lb/>
when its high temperature would be more apparent,<lb/>
&amp; when the dense white smoke rising from it would<lb/>
appear like flame from the reflected light. The<lb/>
appearance of the lava does not correspond to<lb/>
what I had expected to see, it appears liquid<lb/>
only at its exit from the mountain, and tho<lb/>
continually moving on it soon loses its charac-<lb/>
ter of a river of fire, &amp; appears only a shape<lb/>
-less heap of enormous slags covered with ashes,<lb/>
&amp; destroying everything that it meets in its course.<lb/>
A. The fused lava soon cools from the effects of<lb/>
the atmosphere at the surface &amp; forms those<lb/>

A. You have proposed to me in the first place<lb/>
one of the most abstruse questions in modern<lb/>
science: there are great differences of opinion<lb/>
with respect to the causes of heat, but the laws<lb/>
of it or the series of phaenomena which it produces<lb/>
are tolerably well understood &amp; have been scientifically<lb/>
arranged: there are two schools which have adop-<lb/>

of heat, as shown by its own diminution of<lb/>

a quality called their capacities for heat, or their re-<lb/>

a greater or less capacity in proportion as its tem-<lb/>

have the same capacity for heat, or that the<lb/>
number representing their specific caloric being<lb/>
divided by the number representing the weight of<lb/>

Whenever a body has its capacity changed, whether<lb/>
by mechanical or chemical means its tempera-<lb/>
-ture is likewise changed; thus when air in<lb/>
flaccid bladder is suddently dilated by means<lb/>
            <lb/>

13<lb/>
as the airpump its temperature falls on the contrary<lb/>
when air is compressed its temperature rises,<lb/>
and an apparatus has been made for lighting under<lb/>
by the sudden compression of air; when ice is con-<lb/>
-verted into water heat is absorbed, for instance if<lb/>
a pound of water at 172+° be added to a pound<lb/>
of ice at 32+° two pounds of water will be formed<lb/>
of the temperature of 32+° the 140-° degrees in the<lb/>
pound of hot water having been absorbed in con<lb/>
sequence of the increased capacity produced by<lb/>
the liquidification of the ice without raising its<lb/>
temperature.<lb/>
P. I suppose the various mixtures &amp; processes<lb/>
which I have seen for producing artificial cold<lb/>
must depend upon this same principle of change<lb/>
of capacity.<lb/>
A. Precisely so, when two amalgams which are<lb/>

produced &amp; salt &amp; snow, <rs xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

Amidst the variety of researches which<lb/>
have been pursued respecting the different<lb/>
forms &amp; modes of excitation and action<lb/>
of Electricity, it is surprizing to me that<lb/>
the Electricity of living animals has<lb/>
not been more an object of attention,<lb/>
both on account of its physiological<lb/>
importance of its general relation<lb/>
 to the science of Electro-Chemistry.<lb/>

Sweno had disappeared. He attempted<lb/>
to walk towards his boat but found<lb/>
that his limbs refused to perform<lb/>

so that O'Donohoe could hardly behold<lb/>
him without experiencing a sensation<lb/>
of fear &amp; he gladly turned his eyes<lb/>
from the circle of fire towards heaven<lb/>
&amp; fixed them upon Jupiter<lb/>
which was shining with great<lb/>
brightness above his head; after a<lb/>

heard in the air above this was<lb/>
followed by a loud shout like a<lb/>

apparently from the centre of the<lb/>

he quietly rowed to the island. It was<lb/>
a beautiful night, calm &amp; serene<lb/>
but there was no other light but that<lb/>
of the planets &amp; stars. O'Donohoe who<lb/>
had never visited this island at such<lb/>
a season had some difficulty in finding<lb/>
the spot indicated by Sweno but as he<lb/>
approached the centre of the island<lb/>
he saw in the distance a red &amp; glimering<lb/>
flame which he made the guide of his<lb/>
way, when he approached near it he<lb/>
found it was a fire made by some dry<lb/>
wood arranged in a circular order<lb/>
&amp; he saw Sweno sitting on a rock<lb/>
in the centre of the fire; his fair<lb/>
countenance &amp; bright hair lighted<lb/>
up by the reflection of the red light<lb/>
from the glowing embers. "Come not<lb/>
nearer to me O'Donohoe" exclaimed<lb/>
Sweno, "the spirits of the elements<lb/>

he demanded which when given could<lb/>
not be taken away &amp; seemed to require<lb/>
some compensation for conferring so<lb/>
great a benefit. O'Donohue was profuse<lb/>

So a foreigner had not escaped the<lb/>
notice of some of O'Donohoe's oldest<lb/>

who held the highest place in his esteem<lb/>
named O'Brien had remonstrated with<lb/>
his chief on the impolicy of his conduct<lb/>
&amp; had particularly pointed out the<lb/>
impropriety of trusting the young<lb/>
queen to the escort of so handsome,<lb/>
so agreable &amp; so enterprizing a relative,<lb/>
but O'Donohoe was deaf to these repre-<lb/>
=sentations placing unlimited confidence<lb/>
in Sweno. Sweno did not return with<lb/>
the queen so soon as was expected<lb/>
but O'Donohoe received the most<lb/>
tender letters from the queen pointing<lb/>
out a slight indisposition as one cause<lb/>
of the delay &amp; as another the necessity<lb/>
