add to M. S. 3[superscript]d[/superscript] Ed. p.136
Man seems in many instances
Salmonia 3[superscript]d[/superscript] Ed
Note to the addition
in MS 136 -
as man seems in many instances
to have profited by his imitations
of the instincts of animals, as
in building, making caves &
subaqueous constructions like the
Bever, so animals in a state of
domestication seem to have
made something like an approach
towards an imitation of some
of the results of human reason
Salmonia. I think I now
understand distinctly, this
observation
