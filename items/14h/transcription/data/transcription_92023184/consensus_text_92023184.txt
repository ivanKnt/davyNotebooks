more or less luminous.
P. In the last conversation we had on Chemistry
you explained to us the principles & laws of one
of the most importnat of the active powers of matter,
chemical attraction; in the scene now before us &
those which we have lately witnessed, the antagonists
to this power have been active; The principles of
change, of repulsion & of projection in opposition
to the principle of repose & fixity: the agents
which in the persian mythology are considered
as the destruction machines of Arimanes con
-trasted with the creative & productive powers
of Ormutz: it is now a good time for you
Archteus to give us those scientific elucidations
of the subject which we expect from you.
As I must not allow your illustration of the re-
pulsive powers as belonging to Arimanes as contras
ted with the attractive or creative powers typical
in Ormutz to pass without comment: you might
with almost as much propriety have taken an
opposite view of the subject: without change their
is no life, without death there is no regeneration
& [deletion]heaped[/deletion] Heat, Light & those powers which depend
upon repulsive energies are no less essential than
attractions or gravitation in producing beauty
and order of the system of the universe,
