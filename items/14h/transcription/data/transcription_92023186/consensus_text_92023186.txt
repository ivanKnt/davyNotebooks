a repulsive motion or vibration of their particles,
capable, like other motion, of being communicated
acting in opposition to attraction & tending
to separate their particles from each other:
in its greatest or most violent energy causing
these particles to move through free space,
in what is called a radiant state, as light, or
projected heat; acting with less energy producing
gaseous arrangements [underline][superscript]2[/superscript][/underline] or fluid [underline][superscript]1[/superscript][/underline]; & with still
less solid arrangements. By the other school
which may be considered rather as belonging to
continental philosophers, Leibnitz, Boerhaave,
Stahl, Lavoisier, heat is considered as a peculiar
species of very subtle matter, capable of
entering into the pores of bodies & of separating
them from each other & of likewise combining
chemically with them altering their nature
& their their forms, whichever of these hypo-
theses be adapted the phaenomena are capa-
-ble of the same arrangement, for whether
matter or motion be considered as communi.
.cated theresults may be reasoned upon in the
same manner.
P. I find it almost impossible to avoid the con-
-viction that heat is matter, the analogy
between the particles thrown off by an odorous
