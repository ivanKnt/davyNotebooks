of heat in communication and afterwars I shall endeavour
to describe the phaenomena presented by its radiation
Heat is communicated from body to body but with
very different degrees of velocity; those that transmit it
with the greatest quickness are called good conductors
of heat, metals are amongst the best conductors, metal
-lic oxyds, vitreous & strong substances, & vegetable and
animal matter are worse conductors, & fluids in
general conducts heat so ill that it has been even
asserted by Count Rumford that they were nonconductors
what is not correct: the effects of heat on bodies
are all of the same kind, the first effect is that
of expansion, an increase of the body in all its di-
-menions, it is on this property that the thermometer is
is founded; a certain quantity of mercury of which
100,000 parts at the freezing point of water become
101,832 parts at the boiling point is introduced into
a narrow glass tube furnished with a bulb & a
graduated scale which on Fahrenheits plan is de-
-vided before the freezing & the boiling point into 180
degrees, in that of Celcius or the Centigrade into one
hundred degrees & that of Reaumur into 80. [deletion]by[/deletion]
By a certain increase of heat solids become
fluids, & fluids gases & by a diminuation of
heat on the contrary gases are rendered fluids
& fluids, solids; this law appears to be general
