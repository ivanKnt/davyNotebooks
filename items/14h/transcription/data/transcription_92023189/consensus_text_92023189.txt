but the scale of temperature of our globe does
not always afford a means of exhibiting its effects;
it is difficult to produce a degree of heat capable
of fusing platinum & almost as difficult to
obtain a degree of cold in which mercury con-
=geales. Camphor a body naturally solid is easily
rendered [underline]fluid[/underline] by a low degree of heat & by increase
of temperature becomes an elastic fluid & on
the facility with which it undergoes this last change
its odorous qualities depend; many of the metals
are readily enough rendered gaseous by heat,
Such as Zink. Antimony, Tellurium, Arsenic;
others on the contrary as Iron & Platinum do not
assume this state at any of the temperatures we
can command; some of the gases are easily rendered
fluid by a certain degree of cold such as sul-
-phereous acid gas & prussic gas, others require
much lower degrees for this effect such as carbonic
acid & muriatic acid gas; and there are elastic
fluids which have resisted all the means of
diminished temperature which have been applied
to them even when assisted by pressure
Bodies as I said before communicate heat
with very different velocity, & they are like
-wise affected by it in very different manners;
the body in communicating the same quantity
