of heat, as shown by its own diminution of
temperature, to different bodies, affects them in
very different manners & increases their heat to
very different degrees, this is said to depend upon
a quality called their capacities for heat, or their re-
-lations to specific caloric, and a body is said to have
a greater or less capacity in proportion as its tem-
-perature is more or less raised by the addition or
dimished by the subtraction of equal quantities
of heat: In general the capacities of bodies for heat
are greatest in the gaseous state, less in the fluid
& least of all in the solid: you remember that I
mentioned in a former conversation the atomic
hypothesis, that all the chemical elements might
be considered as composed of ultimate particles
having a weight capable of being expressedly a
number. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Petit & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dulong have endeavoured
to prove that the atoms of all simple substances
have the same capacity for heat, or that the
number representing their specific caloric being
divided by the number representing the weight of
their atom, gives nearly the same product.
Whenever a body has its capacity changed, whether
by mechanical or chemical means its tempera-
-ture is likewise changed; thus when air in
