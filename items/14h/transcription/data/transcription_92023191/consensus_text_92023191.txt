as the airpump its temperature falls on the contrary
when air is compressed its temperature rises,
and an apparatus has been made for lighting under
by the sudden compression of air; when ice is con-
-verted into water heat is absorbed, for instance if
a pound of water at 172+째 be added to a pound
of ice at 32+째 two pounds of water will be formed
of the temperature of 32+째 the 140-째 degrees in the
pound of hot water having been absorbed in con
sequence of the increased capacity produced by
the liquidification of the ice without raising its
temperature.
P. I suppose the various mixtures & processes
which I have seen for producing artificial cold
must depend upon this same principle of change
of capacity.
A. Precisely so, when two amalgams which are
solid become fluid by mixture cold is always
produced & salt & snow, muriate of lime & snow
acid & snow, all produce intense cold from this
cause. From the same cause intense cold is
produced when fluids such as ether, & alcohol
of Sulphur become gases: by the evaporation
of the alcohol of sulphur the late D[superscript]r[/superscript] Marcet
