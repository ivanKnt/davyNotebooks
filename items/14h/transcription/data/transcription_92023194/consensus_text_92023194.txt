for crimes dependent upon a
confirmation now dissolved & destroyed
[underline]The Unknown.[/underline] Nothing is more
absurd, I may say more impious
than for man with a ken
surrounded by the dense mists
of sense to [underline]reason[/underline] respecting
the decrees of eternal justice.
you adopt here the same kind
of limited view that you
embraced in reasoning against
the indestructability of the
sentient principle in man
from the apparent division
of the living principle in the polypus
not recollecting that to prove
[deletion]that[/deletion] a quality can be increased
or exalted does not prove
that it can be annihilated.
If there be which I think
cannot be doubted, a consciousness
of good & evil constantly
belonging to the sentient principle
