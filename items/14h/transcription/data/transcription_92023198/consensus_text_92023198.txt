undulations of an etherial medium
It does not however appear
impossible to me that some
of the more refined machinery
of thought may adhere
even in another state of
being to the sentient principle
for though the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] organs
of gross sensation the nervous
& brain are destroyed by
death, yet something
of y[superscript]e[/superscript] more etherial nature
which I have [deletion]imagined[/deletion] [insertion]supposed[/insertion]
may be less destructible.
And [deletion]it[/deletion] sometimes imagine
that [deletion]some[/deletion] [insertion]many[/insertion] of these powers
which have been called
instinctive belong to the
man refined clothing of
the spirit. Conscience indeed
