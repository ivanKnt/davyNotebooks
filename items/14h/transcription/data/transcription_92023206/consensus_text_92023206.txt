are generally employed by
physiologists they have weight
in appearance but not in
reality, they prove that a cer
tain prefection of the machinery
of the body is essential to the
exercise of the powers of mind
but they do not show that the
machine is the mind; without
the eye there can be no sensa-
tions of vision & without the
brain there could be no recollected
[insertion]visible[/insertion] ideas [deletion]of vision[/deletion], but neither
the optic nerve nor the brain
can be considered as the percipi
-ent principle, they are but the
instruments of a [deletion]principle[/deletion] [insertion]power[/insertion]
which has nothing in common
with them. What may he said of the
nervous system may be applied
to a different part of the frame
stop the motion of the heart
of sensibility & life cease
