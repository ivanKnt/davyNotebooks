of electrical action we are still
more ignorant of the nature of the
functions of the nerves, there seems
however a gleam of light worth
pursuing in the peculiarities of
animal Electricity, its connection
with so large a nervous system
its dependence upon the will
of the animal and the instantaneous
nature of its transfer which
may lead when pursued by ade-
-quate engineers to results impor-
-tant for physiology.
The weak state of my health
will I fear prevent me from
following this subject with the
attention it seems to deserve
and I communicate these imper-
fect trials to the Royal Society
in the hope that they may lead
to more extensive and profound
researches
