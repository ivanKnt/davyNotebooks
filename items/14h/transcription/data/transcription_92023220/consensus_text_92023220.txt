It would be desirable to pursue these
enquiries with the Electricity of the Gym-
notus which is so much more powerful
than that of the Torpedo; but if they
are now to be reasoned upon they
seem to shew a stronger analogy
between common & Animal Elec-
-tricity than between Voltaic &
animal Electricity, but it is is I
think more probable that Ani-
-mal Electricity will be found of
a distinctive and peculiar kind.
Common Electricity is excited upon
non conductors & is readily carried
off by conductors & imperfect
conductors.
Voltaic Electricity is excited upon
combinations of perfect and im-
-perfect conductors & is only trans-
-mitted by perfect conductors or
imperfect conductors of the best
kind -
Magnetism, if it be a form of Elect[superscript]ricity[/superscript]
belongs only to perfect conductors &
in its modification to a particular
class of them.
The animal Electricity resides only in
the imperfect conductors forming
