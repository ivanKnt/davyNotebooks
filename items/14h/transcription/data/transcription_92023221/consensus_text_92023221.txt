Electrometer were sufficiently powerful
to be felt in both elbows & once even
in the shoulders.
These negative results may be explained
by supposing that the motion of the
Electricity in the Torpedinal organ is
in no measurable time & that a
current of some contrivance is
necessary to produce the deviation of
the magnetic needle; and found
that the magnetic Electrometer was
eually insensible to the weak
discharge of a Leyden Jar as to
that of the Torpindal organ, tho'
whenever there was a continuous
current from the smallest surfaces
in voltaic combinations of the weak
-est power but which some
chemical action was going on,
it was instantly & powerfully
affected. Two series of Zinc &
Silver & paper moistened in salt
& water caused the permanent
deviation of the needle several
degrees; tho the plates of Zinc were
only 1/6 of an inch in diameter.
