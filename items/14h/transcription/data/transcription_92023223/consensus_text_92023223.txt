to the pile; but on mentioning my
researches to Signor Volta with
whom I passed some time at
Milan that summer he shewed
me another form of his instrument
which appeared to him to fulfill
the conditions of the organ of the
Torpedo, - a pile of which the
fluid substance was a very im-

or a strong, saccharine extract
which required a certain time to
become charged & which did not
decompose water tho' when charged
it communicated weak shocks. -
The discovery of Ã˜rsted at the effects
of the Voltaic Electricity on the mag-

to ascertain if the electricity of
living animals possessed this
power & after [insertion]several[/insertion] many attempts
to procure living Torpedo suffi-

powerful shocks, I succeeded in
