without being able to perceive the
slightest decomposition of that fluid,
and I repeated the same experiments
at Mola di Gaeta with an apparatus
in which the smallest possible surface
of silver was exposed in which good
conductors such as solutions of Potassa
& Sulphuric acid were made to connect
the circuit, but with the same negative
results.
Having obtained a large Torpedo
at Rimini in June in the same year
I repeated the experiments using all
the precautions I could imagine
with like results & at the same
time I passed the shock thro' a
very small circuit which was com-
-pleted by a qua[insertion]r[/insertion]ter of an inch of
extermely fine silver wire drawn
by the late Mr Cavendish for using
in the micrometer & which was less
than the 1/1000 of an inch in diameter,
but no ignition of the wire took
place.
It appeared to me after these experi
