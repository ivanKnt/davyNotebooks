An account of some experiments
on the Torpedo by Sir H. Davy B[sperscript]L[/superscript]
T R S -
Amidst the variety of researches which
have been pursued respecting the different
forms & modes of excitation and action
of Electricity, it is surprizing to me that
the Electricity of living animals has
not been more an object of attention,
both on account of its physiological
importance of its general relation
 to the science of Electro-Chemistry.
In reading an account of the experiments
of Walsh it is impossible not to be
struck by some peculiarities of the
electricity of the organ of the Torpe-
-do & Gymnotus, such as its want
of powers to pass thro' air & the slight
effects of ignition produced by the
strongest shocks, & tho M[supercript]r[/superscript] . Cavendish
with his usual sagacity compared
its action to that of a battery
weakly charged, - when the electricity
was large in quantity but low
in intensity, yet the peculiarities
