& their relationship by marriage to
make him the partaker of that knowledge
which bestowed so much power Sweno
did not at first seem to favour O'Donohue's
wishes, spoke of the greatness of the boon
he demanded which when given could
not be taken away & seemed to require
some compensation for conferring so
great a benefit. O'Donohue was profuse
in his offers of rewards to Sweno, pro-
posed to divide his kingdom with him or to
establish Limerick in a separate prin
-cipality for him in short to do whatever
he desired. Sweno's consent appeared won
by his importunity & he said to O'Donohoe
"I select you because I love you to be
a partner in the power that I now
possess alone & to give you the means
of commanding for the rest of your
life a prosperity & glory belonging
to no other mortal, meet me [deletion]this[/deletion]
at midnight in the island of Mucrish
but come unattended, you will find me
sitting on a rock at the small
[insertion]lake[/insertion] [deletion]spring[/deletion] surrounded by willows which
is exactly in the centre of the island."
