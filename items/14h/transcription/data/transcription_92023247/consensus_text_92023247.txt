had sent messenger after messenger to
Sweno who remained with a part of his
army at Killarney & received always
the same answer that he was imme-

delay arose only from his levying new
forces to ensure his triumph O'Donohoe
was now in a miserable situation, he
was hemmed in on all sides by his
enemies & obliged to take his stand
on the fortified mountain of Innesmoor
where he was in danger of perishing
for want of provisions unless indeed he
preferred the [deletion]dangerous[/deletion] [insertion]perilous[/insertion] alternative
of fighting with his enemies under
great disadvantages of situation &
number. This his last resource he
was at length compelled to adopt
& bringing all his martial Kerry=
=men to [deletion]bare[/deletion] [insertion]bear[/insertion] upon the weakest part
of the ennemies line he attempted
to cut his way thro' it on the pass
of Dunglo which opens on Killarney
The combat was furious & bloody,
O'Donohoe fought with great bravery
