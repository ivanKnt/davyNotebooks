So a foreigner had not escaped the
notice of some of O'Donohoe's oldest
& wisest counsellors; one of them
who held the highest place in his esteem
named O'Brien had remonstrated with
his chief on the impolicy of his conduct
& had particularly pointed out the
impropriety of trusting the young
queen to the escort of so handsome,
so agreable & so enterprizing a relative,
but O'Donohoe was deaf to these repre-
=sentations placing unlimited confidence
in Sweno. Sweno did not return with
the queen so soon as was expected
but O'Donohoe received the most
tender letters from the queen pointing
out a slight indisposition as one cause
of the delay & as another the necessity
of appearing by her presence some
slight discontents which appeared in
the western part of Kerry. The
King was satisfied with these excuses
& as the first offered hints that the queen
was in a state likely to provide his
kingdom with an heir he was contented
that she should remain some time longer
