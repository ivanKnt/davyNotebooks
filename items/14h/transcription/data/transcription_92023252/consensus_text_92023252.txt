O'Donohoe had the dark locks, [deletion]and[/deletion]
[deletion]swart[/deletion] black eyes & swarthy com
plexion which marked his descent
from a southern race, His queen
was fair but had auburn air
& darker eyes than are common
to the Scandinavian people. Swenos
complexion was still fairer than
that of his cousin: his eyes were
bright blue and his hair so [deletion]light[/deletion] [insertion]light[/insertion]
a flaxen colour as to be almost
[deletion]th[/deletion] [insertion]so[/insertion] & [deletion]that[/deletion] it was scarcely pos-
sible to see three persons when they
sat together at table more striking

great a favourite with O'Donahoo
as he was with [deletion]his queen Bertha[/deletion]
He was consulted by him in all
affairs of state employed by
him to train & discipline his
forces & at last accepted a
command under the king as
general of his army. His
near relation[insertion]ship[/insertion] to the queen made
his appointment less surprizing
