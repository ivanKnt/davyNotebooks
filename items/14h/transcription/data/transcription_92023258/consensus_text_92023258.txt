[underline]An Irish Story[/underline] H.D. Wurzen 23
At the time the roman empire
was falling under the attacks of
the northern barbarians & when
every province that had belonged to
the imperial people offered objects
to tempt the cupidity & lust of
plunder, that animated those
numerous hordes that from the
east of Scythia to the west of
Scandniavia poured down like
hungry wolves to devastate &
destroy; the only place of refuge
for the unfortunate citizens
who bore the roman name
was in those countries alone
which had never been a part of
the roman [deletion]empire[/deletion] [insertion]states[/insertion].
The extreme north of Scotland
the western Islands, Ireland
& even Iceland received re.
-fugees from the roman states
& the early civilization of these
rude countries is connected
with this cause.
