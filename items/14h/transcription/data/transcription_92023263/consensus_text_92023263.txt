in the skulls of distinguished archi-
tects; now the skull of the beaver is
so formed that he is able to use his
jaws for cutting down the trees with
which he makes his dam. & if this
analogy were correct the architect
ought unquestionably to employ his
teeth for the same purposes, and
tho' I have known distinguished
men who have been in the habit
of using knives for cutting furniture
with a sort of nervous restlessness of
hand, I do not recollect to have heard
of the teeth being employed in the
same way, & I think it would be
quite as correct to find the architect-
-ural or constructive organ in the
opposite part of the body, the tail
as the beaver makes a more in-
-genious use of this part than
even of his mouth. Pray have
you ever observed Poietes any
particular protuberance in
the nether parts of any of
our distinguished architects?
