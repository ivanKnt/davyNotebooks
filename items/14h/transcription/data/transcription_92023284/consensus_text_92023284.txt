to impress us with a
beauty higher & more
delightful [insertion]even[/insertion] than that of
the peaceful & glorious
calm :
I remember in 1809 having
a long conversation with the
late D[superscript]r[/superscript] Jenner on the habits
of animals. He was always
original & ingenious but I
think was sometimes carried
too far by the remoteness of
his analogies. We were dis
-cussing the possibility of the
uses of earthworms to man
I was [deletion]rather[/deletion] more disposed
to consider the dung hill &
putrefaction as useful to the
worm rather than the worm as
an agent important to man
in the economy of nature.
