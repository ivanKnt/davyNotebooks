but D[superscript]r[/superscript] Jenner would not
allow my reason he said
The earthworms particularly
about the time of the vernal
equinox move much under
& along the surface of our
moist meadow lands
wherever they move they
leave a trail of mucous be
=hind them which becomes
a manure to the plant. In
this respect they act as the slug
does in furnishing materials
for food to the vegetable King
=dom & under the surface they
break stiff clods in pieces &
finely divide the soil. They feed
likewise entirely on inorganic ma
=tter & are rather the scavengers
than the tyrants of the vegetable
system- Feb 28
