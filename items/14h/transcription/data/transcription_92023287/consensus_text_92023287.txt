you an idea of the train of argument
I intend to pursue when I say that you
might as well expect by taking a
puppy from a wild esquimaux dog &
educating & training him as a pointer
to give him the peculiar habits & ex-
=cellencies of a highly finished animal of
that superior race he would no more
gain the habits of the pointer however
severe the discipline to which he had been
submitted & however great the pains taken
in his training than he would gain the
form of the pointer or change his dense
shaggy hair for the smooth & sleek skin
of the cultivated animals
On. This form of argument does appear
to me [insertion]to be[/insertion] ridiculous: you might almost
as well knock me down as a reasoner
by saying that the moral and intellect
-ual qualities of the Tartar could no
more change by cultivation than his
physical ones & it would be as easy
to raise his flat nose to the height
of the purest grecian model as to
exalt his gross mind to the refine
=ments & powers of a philosopher.
