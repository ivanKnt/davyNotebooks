therefore that pass from system to system
in progression towards powers & knowledge
preserve at least this on invariable
character & their intellectual life may
be said to depend more or less upon
the influence of light [deletion]as[/deletion] As far as my
knowledge extends even in other worlds
the more perfect organized systems
still possess their source of sensation
& of enjoyment but with higher natures
finer & more etherial kinds of matter

to common matter that the refined
or most subtle gazes do to common
solids & fluids: The universe is every
where full of life but the modes of
this life are infinitely diversified
& yet every form of it must be enjoyed
& known by every spiritual nature
before the consummation of all things
You have seen the comet moving
with its immense train of light
Thro' the sky: this likewise has a
system supplied with living beings
& their existence derives it enjoyment
