imperfect in their function [insertion]2[/insertion] & not unlike in
their organisations [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] the zoophytes of the polar
sea [insertion]to which they are[/insertion] have a sphere of sensibility & intellectual
enjoyment far superior to that of the inhabitants
of your earth; each of those tubes which
appear like the trunk of an elephant is
an organ of peculiar motion or sensation
They have many modes of perception of
which you are wholly ignorant at the
same time that their sphere of vision is
infinitively more extended than yours,
& their organ of touch far more perfect &
exquisitte, they pass from place to place thro
the atmosphere & their powers of locomotion
consequently are far superior to yours, it
would be useless for me to attempt to ex-
-plain their organisation which you could
never understand but of their intellectual
objects of pursuit I may perhaps give
you some notion; they have used modified
and applied the material world in a
manner analogous to man, but with
far superior powers they have gained su
-perior results, their atmosphere being
much denser than your & the speci
