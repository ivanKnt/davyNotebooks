which I have heard [deletion]D[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion] Mr Herschel often
express a wish that he could see it-
It seemed as if I was on the verge of
the solar system & my moving sphere
of light now appeared to pause I again
heard the low & sweet voice of the
Genius which said "You are now on
the verge of your own system,
will you go further or return to
earth." I replied "I have left [deletion]a place[/deletion] [insertion]an abode[/insertion]
which is damp, dreary, dark & cold
I am now in a place where all is
life, light & enjoyment show me at
least before I return the glimpse
which you promise me of those
superior intellectual natures & the
modes of their being & their enjoyments
There are [insertion]said the Genius [deletion]beings[/deletion] [insertion]Creatures[/insertion] as superior to any idea
your imagination can form, in that part of
the system now before you comprehending
[insertion]Saturn[/insertion] his moons & rings, I will carry you to
the verge of the immense atmosphere of
This planet. In that space you will see
sufficient to wonder at & far more than
with your present organisation it would
be possible for me to make you understand
