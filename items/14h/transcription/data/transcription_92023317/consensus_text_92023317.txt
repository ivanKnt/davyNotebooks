which appear almost possest of intelligence
waggons are moved by it, constructions
made, vessels caused to move in opposition

affect the comforts of life; the collecting
from fossil materials the elements of
combustion and applying them so as to
illuminate by a single op[deletion]p[/deletion]eration houses
streets & even cities; if you look to the
results of the chemical arts you will
find new substances of the most ex-

various novel purposes of life, you
will find a few experiments in electricity
leading to the marvelous results of
disarming the thunder cloud of its terrors,
