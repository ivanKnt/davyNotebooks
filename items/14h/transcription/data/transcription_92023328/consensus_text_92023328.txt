eyes. I shall describe this scene & the others
in the succession in which they appeared before
me & the observations by which they were
accompanied in the voice of the wonderful
being who appeared as [deletion]b[/deletion]my [deletion]genius or[/deletion] in-
=tellectual guide. In the scene which followed
that of the agricultural or pastoral people
I saw [insertion]a[/insertion] great extent of cultivated plains, large
cities on the sea shore, domes, forums &
temples ornamenting them; Men associated
in groups, mounted on horses & performing
military exercises, gallies moved by oars on
the ocean, roads intersecting the country
covered with travellers & containing carriages
moved by oxen or horses. The genius now
said "You see the early [deletion]e[/deletion]state [insertion]state[/insertion] of civilization
of man, the cottages of the last race that
you beheld, have become improved into stately
dwellings, palaces & temples in which use is
combined with ornament, the few men to whom
as I said before the foundations of these
improvements [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]were[/insertion] owing have had divine
honours payed to their memory: but look
at the instruments belonging to this generation
[deletion]of men[/deletion] & you will find that they are only
of brass, you see men who are talking
