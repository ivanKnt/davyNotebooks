These groups of men who are
escaped from the state of infancy
they owe their improvement
to a few superior minds still
amongst them: That aged man
that you see with a crowd
around him taught them
to build cottages. From that other
they learnt to domesticate cattle.
From others to collect & sow
corn and seeds of fruit, & these
arts will never be lost, another
generation will see them more
perfect. The houses in a
century more will be
larger & more convenient
The flocks of cattle more numerous
the corn fields more extensive,
the morasses will be drained,
the fruit trees increased -
