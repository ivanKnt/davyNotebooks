ruins of this, - no new empire will be founded
upon these colossal remains of the old Romans.
The world like the individual flourishes in
youth, rises to strength in manhood, falls into
decay in age: and the ruins of an empire
are like the decayed frame of an individual,
except that they have some tints of beauty
which nature bestows upon them: the sun
of civilization arose in the East and advanced
toward the West, it [insertion]is[/insertion] now [deletion]probably[/deletion] at [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] meridian

New World & there will be left darkness only

sand where there were populous cities
& stagnant morasses where the green meadow
or the bright cornfield once appeared. -
I called up images of this kind in my ima-

purifies and as it were sanctifies the mind
destroys & brings into utter decay the
body & even in nature its influence
