in the history of the early world you would have found
found the Christian dispensation naturally arising out
of the Jewish & the doctrines & creeds of the pagan
nations all preparatory to the triumph & final
establishment of a creed fitted for the most enlight-
- ened state of the human mind & equally adapted [insertion]adapted[/insertion]
to every climate & every people.
To this animated apeal of Ambrosio Onuphrio
replied in the most tranquil manner & with
the air of an unmoved philosopher - "You
mistake me Ambrosio if you consider me as
hostile to Christianity: I am not of the school
of the french Encylopedists or of the english infidels
I consider religion as esential to man & belonging
to the human mind in the same manner as
instincts belong to the brute creation, a light
if you please of revelation to guide him thro' the
darkness of this life & to keep alive his nudging
hope of immortality, but pardon me if I
consider this instinct as equally useful
in all its different forms & still as a divine
light thro whatever medium or cloud of human
passion or prejudice it passes. I reverence it in
the follower of Bramah in the disciple of
Mahomet & I wonder at it in all the variety
of forms it adopts in the christian world.
