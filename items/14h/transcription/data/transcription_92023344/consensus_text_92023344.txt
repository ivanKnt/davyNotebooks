say that the preservation of this pile by the sanc-

almost a miraculous event & [insertion]And[/insertion] what a contrast
the present application of this building connec-

of the ancient one when it was used for exhibiting
to the Roman people the destruction of men
by wild beasts or of men more savage than
wild beasts by each other, to gratify a horrible
appetite for cruelty founded upon a still more
[deletion]horrible[/deletion] [insertion]detestable[/insertion] lust, that of universal domination, that
of making all mankind slaves to the imperial
people [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]And[/insertion] who would have supposed in the time
of [deletion]Titus[/deletion] [insertion]Nero[/insertion] that a faith despised in its insignificant
origin & persecuted from the supposed [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]obscurity[/insertion] of its
founder & it principles, should have [deletion]reared[/deletion] [insertion]raised[/insertion] a [deletion]temple[/deletion] [insertion]Dome[/insertion]
to [insertion]the memory of[/insertion] one of its humble teachers more glorious than
was ever framed for [person_795]Jupiter[/person_795] or Apollo in the ancient
world, & have preserved even the ruins of the temples
of the pagan deities, & have burst forth in
splendour & majesty consecrating truth even amidst
the shrines of error, employing the idols of the
Roman superstition for the most holy purposes,
& raising a bright and constant light amidst the
dark & starless night which followed the des-
-truction of the Roman empire.
