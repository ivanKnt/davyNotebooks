of execution! had we not historical documents
to inform us of the period when this structure was
raised & of the purposes for which it was designed,
it might be imagined the work of a race of giants,
a council chamber for those Titans fabled to have
warred against the Gods of the pagan mythology.
The size of the masses of travertin of which it is
composed is in harmony with the immense mag-
-nitude of the building. It is hardly to be wondered
at that a people which constructed such works
for their daily sports for their usual amusements
should have possessed strength, enduring energy
& perseverance sufficient to enable them to
conquer the world: their [insertion]They[/insertion] appear always to have
formed their plans & made their combinations
as if their power were beyond the reach of chance
independent of the influence of time & founded for
unlimited duration [insertion]-[/insertion] for eternity!
A. took up the discourse of O. & said. & "The aspect of
this wonderful heap of ruins is so picturesque
that it is impossible to regret its decay & at this
season of the year the colours of the vegetation
are in harmony with those of the falling
building & how perfectly the whole landscape
 is in Tone! The remains of the palace of
the Caesars & of the golden halls of Nero
