            I was again in motion &amp; again almost<br xml:id="">

            <br xml:id="">
            <span class="strikethrough wordstrike-n" title="Deleted Text">gave me the idea more</span>
            <span class="inline-n" title="This text added from "><span class="delim">|</span>something<span class="delim">|</span></span> like that of an<br xml:id="">
            immense glacier covered with large colum=<br xml:id="">
            -nar masses which appeared as if formed<br xml:id="">
            of glass &amp; from which were suspended<br xml:id="">
            rounded forms of various sizes which if<br xml:id="">
            they had not been transparent I might have<br xml:id="">
            supposed to be fruit; from what appeared to<br xml:id="">
            me to be analogous to <span class="inline-n" title="This text added from "><span class="delim">|</span>masses of bright blue ice<span class="delim">|</span></span>

            Looking thro the atmosphere towards the<br xml:id="">

            of an azure colour <span class="inline-n" title="This text added from "><span class="delim">|</span>that<span class="delim">|</span></span>

            -possible to describe; they had systems<br xml:id="">
            for locomotion similar to those of the<br xml:id="">
