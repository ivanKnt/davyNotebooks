         <h2>Brass</h2>
         
         
         <p>Brass is an alloy of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), in proportions which can be varied
            to achieve different colours and mechanical, electrical, acoustic, and chemical properties,
            but copper typically has the larger proportion.</p>
