            is desirous of knowing &amp; sharing your<br xml:id="">
            power I commit to you his destinies'<br xml:id="">
            To O'Donohue he said, 'You have nothing<br xml:id="">
            now to do but to plunge into the lake<br xml:id="">
            you will come out of it a new being<br xml:id="">
            filled with wisdom &amp; that strength<br xml:id="">
            which will subdue all things to your<br xml:id="">
            purposes lose no time." O'Donohue<br xml:id="">
            rushed forward &amp; precipitated him-<br xml:id="">
            self headlong thro the luminous<br xml:id="">
            atmosphere into the lake. After<br xml:id="">
            this he was wholly insensible <span class="strikethrough wordstrike-n" title="Deleted Text">of</span> to<br xml:id="">

            had fallen he found himself cold<br xml:id="">
            wet &amp; shivering upon the side of<br xml:id="">
            the lake. The sun had risen &amp; was<br xml:id="">
            shining upon him in all its brightness<br xml:id="">
            but his limbs appeared cold as ice<br xml:id="">
            Sweno had disappeared. He attempted<br xml:id="">
            to walk towards his boat but found<br xml:id="">
            that his limbs refused to perform<br xml:id="">
            their functions; he looked into the<br xml:id="">
            calm &amp; bright water &amp; what was<br xml:id="">
