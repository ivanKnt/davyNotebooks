            A: The violence of the eruption is now over; tho clouds<br xml:id="">
            still cover the top of the mountain yet I think<br xml:id="">
            we can ascend to the spot from whence the lava<br xml:id="">
            issues as from a fountain and what a magnificent<br xml:id="">
            sight is this river of fire nearly half a mile in<br xml:id="">
            length &amp; in some places 50 yards broad.<br xml:id="">
            P: It would be still more magnificent in the night<br xml:id="">
            when its high temperature would be more apparent,<br xml:id="">
            &amp; when the dense white smoke rising from it would<br xml:id="">
            appear like flame from the reflected light. The<br xml:id="">
            appearance of the lava does not correspond to<br xml:id="">
            what I had expected to see, it appears liquid<br xml:id="">
            only at its exit from the mountain, and tho<br xml:id="">
            continually moving on it soon loses its charac-<br xml:id="">
            ter of a river of fire, &amp; appears only a shape<br xml:id="">
            -less heap of enormous slags covered with ashes,<br xml:id="">
            &amp; destroying everything that it meets in its course.<br xml:id="">
            A. The fused lava soon cools from the effects of<br xml:id="">
            the atmosphere at the surface &amp; forms those<br xml:id="">
