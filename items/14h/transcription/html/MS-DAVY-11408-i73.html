            So a foreigner had not escaped the<br xml:id="">
            notice of some of O'Donohoe's oldest<br xml:id="">
            &amp; wisest counsellors; one of them<br xml:id="">
            who held the highest place in his esteem<br xml:id="">
            named O'Brien had remonstrated with<br xml:id="">
            his chief on the impolicy of his conduct<br xml:id="">
            &amp; had particularly pointed out the<br xml:id="">
            impropriety of trusting the young<br xml:id="">
            queen to the escort of so handsome,<br xml:id="">
            so agreable &amp; so enterprizing a relative,<br xml:id="">
            but O'Donohoe was deaf to these repre-<br xml:id="">
            =sentations placing unlimited confidence<br xml:id="">
            in Sweno. Sweno did not return with<br xml:id="">
            the queen so soon as was expected<br xml:id="">
            but O'Donohoe received the most<br xml:id="">
            tender letters from the queen pointing<br xml:id="">
            out a slight indisposition as one cause<br xml:id="">
            of the delay &amp; as another the necessity<br xml:id="">
            of appearing by her presence some<br xml:id="">
            slight discontents which appeared in<br xml:id="">
