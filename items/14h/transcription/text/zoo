Continuation of the fourth dialogue.
Subject. Active powers of matter
Place. Phlegraean Fields
A. It is now almost the time when we should
perceive the dawning of the eastern light, but
from those heavy clouds, which obscure the
whole of our horizon & from the long continued
& dead stillness of the mountain I suspect
that we are on the eve of some great change
and a storm, if not an eruption is approaching
so that I think it will be prudent for us to
return to Naples. The change in the appearance
of the sky renders a view of the distant scenery
at sunrise impossible. The party return to Naples.
P. It would have been too much to have expected
in twenty four hours & after so [deletion]glorious[/deletion] [insertion]splendid[/insertion] a
Sunset as we witnessed last evening to have ex-
-pected the reappearance [insertion]appearance[/insertion] of that glorious luminary
under the same brillant & beautiful circumstances.
but the storm which you augured does not yet
fall, and there is a peculiar heat in the air and
the sea tho' there is no breath of wind seems to
roll waves almost as black as pitch from
the reflexion of the sky towards the shore
A. Surely I felt at that moment a motion of the

[page]6||dnp14h004pp|92023182[/page]
ground beneath me, & hark! The bells of the
churches jingle, surely it was the slight shock
of an earthquake.
All. We felt it.
A. Watch the mountain, See the pitchy cloud
on the top of it bursts open & a column of 
flames, & a jet of lava & red hot stones rises
into the middle heaven! The ground again
shakes & lo! The tremendous thunder of an
eruption!
P. Lo' The lava bursts forth from the top,
& watch the skies filled with flame! A
river of fire descends to the earth! I 
give you joy. Archteus that the wish which
you have so long indulged is gratified, &
that you will have an opportunity of ex-
-amining & studying the results of a volcanic
eruption, but the lightening now flashes into
the thick clouds with the flame of the volcano
& the thunders of the heavens as it were re-
-bound to the noise at the subterraneous ar
-tillery; The rain falls in torrents, & a thick
cloud which from its extreme darkness &
opacity must contain stones or dust is ap-
-proaching towards Naples: We must wait
for another day to make our visit to

[page]7||dnp14h005pp|92023183[/page]

to the mountain; it would now be as service of
danger to attempt to approach it
A Change of scene. The base of Vesuvius
A: The violence of the eruption is now over; tho clouds
still cover the top of the mountain yet I think
we can ascend to the spot from whence the lava
issues as from a fountain and what a magnificent
sight is this river of fire nearly half a mile in
length & in some places 50 yards broad.
P: It would be still more magnificent in the night
when its high temperature would be more apparent,
& when the dense white smoke rising from it would
appear like flame from the reflected light. The
appearance of the lava does not correspond to
what I had expected to see, it appears liquid
only at its exit from the mountain, and tho
continually moving on it soon loses its charac-
ter of a river of fire, & appears only a shape
-less heap of enormous slags covered with ashes,
& destroying everything that it meets in its course.
A. The fused lava soon cools from the effects of
the atmosphere at the surface & forms those
large masses of scoria, the liquid still moves
on below, being pressed forward by the new
portions thrown out from the fountain, but
in a dark night, all these masses would appear

[page]8||dnp14h006pp|92023184[/page]
more or less luminous.
P. In the last conversation we had on Chemistry
you explained to us the principles & laws of one
of the most importnat of the active powers of matter,
chemical attraction; in the scene now before us &
those which we have lately witnessed, the antagonists
to this power have been active; The principles of
change, of repulsion & of projection in opposition
to the principle of repose & fixity: the agents
which in the persian mythology are considered
as the destruction machines of Arimanes con
-trasted with the creative & productive powers
of Ormutz: it is now a good time for you
Archteus to give us those scientific elucidations
of the subject which we expect from you.
As I must not allow your illustration of the re-
pulsive powers as belonging to Arimanes as contras
ted with the attractive or creative powers typical
in Ormutz to pass without comment: you might
with almost as much propriety have taken an
opposite view of the subject: without change their
is no life, without death there is no regeneration
& [deletion]heaped[/deletion] Heat, Light & those powers which depend
upon repulsive energies are no less essential than
attractions or gravitation in producing beauty
and order of the system of the universe,

[page]9||dnp14h007pp|92023185[/page]
and in creating these living forms, which are
perpetually renovated in nature.
P. In what we see of fire we witness only its
consuming & destructive agency.
A. This I deny: and I might as well say that
what we see of attraction on the side of a
Glacier we witness only the principle of torpidity
& death but the same kind of heat which sends
forth the lava & spreads showers of ashes over
the soils in its milder energy causes the river
to irrigate the meadow, and sensds the vernal
shower to fertilize the soils.
P. What is this heat, and by what laws is it go-
verned?
A. You have proposed to me in the first place
one of the most abstruse questions in modern
science: there are great differences of opinion
with respect to the causes of heat, but the laws
of it or the series of phaenomena which it produces
are tolerably well understood & have been scientifically
arranged: there are two schools which have adop-
ted each a different hypothesis respecting the cause
of heat by one, which may be regarded as the
School of Bacon, Boyle, Hooke, & Newton
heat is regarded as a quality or property of
which every species of matter is susceptible,

[page]10||dnp14h008pp|92023186[/page]
a repulsive motion or vibration of their particles,
capable, like other motion, of being communicated
acting in opposition to attraction & tending
to separate their particles from each other:
in its greatest or most violent energy causing
these particles to move through free space,
in what is called a radiant state, as light, or
projected heat; acting with less energy producing
gaseous arrangements [underline][superscript]2[/superscript][/underline] or fluid [underline][superscript]1[/superscript][/underline]; & with still
less solid arrangements. By the other school
which may be considered rather as belonging to
continental philosophers, Leibnitz, Boerhaave,
Stahl, Lavoisier, heat is considered as a peculiar
species of very subtle matter, capable of
entering into the pores of bodies & of separating
them from each other & of likewise combining
chemically with them altering their nature
& their their forms, whichever of these hypo-
theses be adapted the phaenomena are capa-
-ble of the same arrangement, for whether
matter or motion be considered as communi.
.cated theresults may be reasoned upon in the
same manner.
P. I find it almost impossible to avoid the con-
-viction that heat is matter, the analogy
between the particles thrown off by an odorous

[page]11||dnp14h009pp|92023187[/page]

body, & the effects of a hot body is so striking
that it amounts in my mind to a demonstration
& I hope you will adopt in your illustration
the term calorie as the cause of heat which will
prevent any confusion of language.
A. Nay my friend, I think you are reasoning too
hastily: without motion as Lavoisier long ago
expressed their can be no sensation, & a strong
analogy from the senses might be brought forward
against the opinion, which you adopt in so un.
-qualified a manner: sound, we know, is produced
by vibrations or undulations in the air and the
laws of its communication & reflexion are
much more analogous to those of the reflexion
& communication of heat than any of the circum-
-stances connected with the phaenomena of smell,
besides Count Rumford excited by friction
heat in a continuous manner for a great length
of time & this constant exitation of Caloric
if you please to call it so by mechanical
means certainly throws some doubt over the
hypothesiswhic you are so desirous of adopting
Let me advise you therefore to suspend your
opinion at least till you have attended a
little more to the phaenomena of this agent.
I shall just say a few words as to the laws

[page]12||dnp14h010pp|92023188[/page]
of heat in communication and afterwars I shall endeavour
to describe the phaenomena presented by its radiation
Heat is communicated from body to body but with
very different degrees of velocity; those that transmit it
with the greatest quickness are called good conductors
of heat, metals are amongst the best conductors, metal
-lic oxyds, vitreous & strong substances, & vegetable and
animal matter are worse conductors, & fluids in
general conducts heat so ill that it has been even
asserted by Count Rumford that they were nonconductors
what is not correct: the effects of heat on bodies
are all of the same kind, the first effect is that
of expansion, an increase of the body in all its di-
-menions, it is on this property that the thermometer is
is founded; a certain quantity of mercury of which
100,000 parts at the freezing point of water become
101,832 parts at the boiling point is introduced into
a narrow glass tube furnished with a bulb & a
graduated scale which on Fahrenheits plan is de-
-vided before the freezing & the boiling point into 180
degrees, in that of Celcius or the Centigrade into one
hundred degrees & that of Reaumur into 80. [deletion]by[/deletion]
By a certain increase of heat solids become
fluids, & fluids gases & by a diminuation of
heat on the contrary gases are rendered fluids
& fluids, solids; this law appears to be general

[page]13||dnp14h011pp|92023189[/page]
11
but the scale of temperature of our globe does
not always afford a means of exhibiting its effects;
it is difficult to produce a degree of heat capable
of fusing platinum & almost as difficult to
obtain a degree of cold in which mercury con-
=geales. Camphor a body naturally solid is easily
rendered [underline]fluid[/underline] by a low degree of heat & by increase
of temperature becomes an elastic fluid & on
the facility with which it undergoes this last change
its odorous qualities depend; many of the metals
are readily enough rendered gaseous by heat,
Such as Zink. Antimony, Tellurium, Arsenic;
others on the contrary as Iron & Platinum do not
assume this state at any of the temperatures we
can command; some of the gases are easily rendered
fluid by a certain degree of cold such as sul-
-phereous acid gas & prussic gas, others require
much lower degrees for this effect such as carbonic
acid & muriatic acid gas; and there are elastic
fluids which have resisted all the means of
diminished temperature which have been applied
to them even when assisted by pressure
Bodies as I said before communicate heat
with very different velocity, & they are like
-wise affected by it in very different manners;
the body in communicating the same quantity

[page]14||dnp14h012pp|92023190[/page]
of heat, as shown by its own diminution of
temperature, to different bodies, affects them in
very different manners & increases their heat to
very different degrees, this is said to depend upon
a quality called their capacities for heat, or their re-
-lations to specific caloric, and a body is said to have
a greater or less capacity in proportion as its tem-
-perature is more or less raised by the addition or
dimished by the subtraction of equal quantities
of heat: In general the capacities of bodies for heat
are greatest in the gaseous state, less in the fluid
& least of all in the solid: you remember that I
mentioned in a former conversation the atomic
hypothesis, that all the chemical elements might
be considered as composed of ultimate particles
having a weight capable of being expressedly a
number. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Petit & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dulong have endeavoured
to prove that the atoms of all simple substances
have the same capacity for heat, or that the
number representing their specific caloric being
divided by the number representing the weight of
their atom, gives nearly the same product.
Whenever a body has its capacity changed, whether
by mechanical or chemical means its tempera-
-ture is likewise changed; thus when air in
flaccid bladder is suddently dilated by means

[page]15||dnp14h013pp|92023191[/page]
13
as the airpump its temperature falls on the contrary
when air is compressed its temperature rises,
and an apparatus has been made for lighting under
by the sudden compression of air; when ice is con-
-verted into water heat is absorbed, for instance if
a pound of water at 172+° be added to a pound
of ice at 32+° two pounds of water will be formed
of the temperature of 32+° the 140-° degrees in the
pound of hot water having been absorbed in con
sequence of the increased capacity produced by
the liquidification of the ice without raising its
temperature.
P. I suppose the various mixtures & processes
which I have seen for producing artificial cold
must depend upon this same principle of change
of capacity.
A. Precisely so, when two amalgams which are
solid become fluid by mixture cold is always
produced & salt & snow, muriate of lime & snow
acid & snow, all produce intense cold from this
cause. From the same cause intense cold is
produced when fluids such as ether, & alcohol
of Sulphur become gases: by the evaporation
of the alcohol of sulphur the late D[superscript]r[/superscript] Marcet
suceeded in freezing mercury

of the acts of his consciousness

you adopt here the same kind
of limited view that you
embraced in reasoning against
the indestructability of the
sentient principle in man
from the apparent division
of the living principle in the polypus
not recollecting that to prove
[deletion]that[/deletion] a quality can be increased
or exalted does not prove
that it can be annihilated.
If there be which I think
cannot be doubted, a consciousness

view I have ventured to suggest. -
Eubathes I cannot make you
views coincide with what I
have been accustomed to
consider as the meaning of
holy writ. You allow every
theory belonging to this material
life to be dependent upon
the organization of the body:
& yet you imagine the spirit
after death cloaked with
a new body & on the system
of rewards & punishment, this
body is rendered happy or
miserable for actions committed
by another & an extinct frame.
A particular organization of the
stomach or [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] sexual organs
leads to improper & immoral
gratifications, it does not
appear to me according to
the principles of eternal justice
that the [deletion]being[/deletion] body of the
resurrection should be punished

[page]20||dnp14h018pp|92023196[/page]
& the creator breathes into him
the breath of life - His
own essence.
Then our Saviour has said
of the god of Abraham of
Isaac & of Jacob. He is
not the god of the dead but
of the living.
S[superscript]t[/superscript] Paul has described
the cloaking of the spirit
in a new & glorious body
taking the analogy from
the living germ in the [deletion][underline]plants[/underline][/deletion]
seed of the plant, which is
not quickened till after apparent
death.

It does not however appear
impossible to me that some
of the more refined machinery
of thought may adhere
even in another state of
being to the sentient principle
for though the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] organs
of gross sensation the nervous
& brain are destroyed by
death, yet something
of y[superscript]e[/superscript] more etherial nature
which I have [deletion]imagined[/deletion] [insertion]supposed[/insertion]
may be less destructible.
And [deletion]it[/deletion] sometimes imagine
that [deletion]some[/deletion] [insertion]many[/insertion] of these powers

which may bear the same
relations to heat light & electri
-city that these refined forms
or modes of existence of
matter bear to the gases
Motion is most easily produced
by the lighter species of matter
& yet imponderable agents
such as electricity possess force
sufficient to shake or overturn

nothin can be further from
my meaning than to attempt
any definitions on this sub
-ject nor would I even embrace
or give authority to that idea
of Newton who supposes
that the immediate cause
of sensation may be in

[page]24||dnp14h022pp|92023200[/page]
a thousand years as the man
now is with respect [unclear]to[/unclear] what
happened in the first year of
his life To attempt to reason
[deletion]about[/deletion] [insertion]upon[/insertion] the manner in which
the organs are connected with
sensation would be wholly
useless, the nerves & brain
have some immediate [deletion]connection[/deletion] [insertion]relation to[/insertion]
[deletion]with[/deletion] these vital functions but
how they act it is impossible
to say; from the rapidity &
the infinite variety of the
phaenomena of perception
it seems extremely probable
that there must be in the brain
& nerves matter of a nature
far more subtle & refined
than any thing discovered in
by a observating & experi
=ment & that the immediate
connexion between the sentient
principle & the body may be
established by kinds of essential
matter which can never be

as those instruments change and
in old age the mind is as it were
falling asleep to awake to
a new existence With its present
organization the intellect of
man is a naturally limited
& imperfect but this depends
upon its material machinery
from a higher organized form
it might be imagined to possess
infinitely higher powers; were
man to be imortal with his
present corporeal machinery
this immortality would only
belong to the machinery for
with respect to mind he would
virtually die every two or three
hundred years that is to say
a certain quantity only of
ideas could be remembered
& the supposed immortal
being would be with respect
to what had happened for

it is impossible to deny as it
is impossible to deny that
mathematical truths depend
upon the signs which express
them but these signs are
not themselves the truths
nor are the organs the mind
The whole history of intellect is
a history of change but change
according to a certain law
& we retain the memory only
of those changes which may
be useful to us. The child when
born [deletion]immediately[/deletion] forgets
what happened to it in the
womb the recollections of the
infant likewise before two years
are soon lost yet many of the
habits acquired in that age
are retained thro' life. The
sentient principle [insertion]gains[/insertion] [deletion]acquires[/deletion]
thoughts by material instru-
-ments & its sensations change

[page]27||dnp14h025pp|92023203[/page]
25
ning to its operations, we can
place no limit to them: we
sometimes in sleep lose the
beginning & end of a dream
I recollect the middle of it
& one dream has [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] no connexion
with another & yet we are conscious
of an infinite variety of dreams
& there is a strong analogy
for believing in an infinity
of past existences which must
have had connexion of human
life may be regarded as a type
of infinite of immortal life
& its succession of sleep & dreams
as a type of the [insertion]changes of[/insertion] death & birth
to which from its nature it is
liable that the ideas belonging
to the mind were originally
gained from those classes
of sensations called organs

[page]28||dnp14h026pp|92023204[/page]
organized structures. Profoundly
ignorant on this subject all that
we can do is to give a history
at our own minds The exter-
-nal world or matter itself
is to us in fact not being but
a heap or cluster of sensations
& in looking back to the memory
of our own being we find one
principle which may be
called the monad or self
constantly present associating
with a particular class of sen-
-sations always present and
which we call our own body
or organs. Those organs are
connected with other sensations
& more as it were with them
in circles of existence quitting
for a time some trains of
sensation to return. To others
but the monad is always
present we can fix no begin-

yet life [insertion]the living principle[/insertion] is not in the heart nor
in the arterial flood blood which it
sends to every part of the sys-
-tem [deletion]no more can it be considered[/deletion]
[deletion]as belonging to the brain.[/deletion] A savage
who saw the operations of a
number of power looms weaving
stockings cease at once on stopping
the motions of a wheel might well
well imagine that the motive
force was in the wheel; he could
not divine that it more immedi-
-ately depended upon the steam
of ultimately upon a fire below
a concealed boiler. The philosopher
sees the fire which [deletion]produces[/deletion] &
is the cause of the motion
of this complicated machinery
unintelligible to the savage but
both are equally ignorant of
the divine fire which is the
cause of the mechanism of

are generally employed by
physiologists they have weight
in appearance but not in
reality, they prove that a cer
tain prefection of the machinery
of the body is essential to the
exercise of the powers of mind
but they do not show that the
machine is the mind; without
the eye there can be no sensa-
tions of vision & without the
brain there could be no recollected
[insertion]visible[/insertion] ideas [deletion]of vision[/deletion], but neither
the optic nerve nor the brain
can be considered as the percipi
-ent principle, they are but the
instruments of a [deletion]principle[/deletion] [insertion]power[/insertion]
which has nothing in common
with them. What may he said of the
nervous system may be applied
to a different part of the frame
stop the motion of the heart
of sensibility & life cease

the dependence of all the higher
faculties of the mind upon [deletion]the[/deletion]
state of the brain, remember that
not all[superscript]2[/superscript] only[superscript]1[/superscript] the intellectual powers
but even sensibility is destroyed
but the pressure of a little blood
upon the cerebellum & the diffi-
culties increase call to mind
likewise the supervision of ani-
mation in cases similar to
that of our friend when there
are no signs of life & when
animation return only with
the return of organic action
Surely in all these instances, every
thing which you consider as
belonging to spirit appears
in intimate [deletion]relation[/deletion] dependence
upon the arrangements & properties
of matter.
[underline]The Uknown.[/underline] The argument that
you have used are those which

[page]32||dnp14h030pp|92023208[/page]
after cannot be imagined to have
possessed the slightest intellectual
characer; if a peculiar prin
-ciple by supposed necessary
to intelligence it must exist
throughout animated nature!
The elephant approaches near-
-er to man in intellectual
powers, that the oyster does
to the elephant; & a link of
sensitive natures maybe
traced from the polypus
to the philosophers. Now
in the polypus this sentient
principle is divisible & from
polypus of one earthworm
maybe formed two or three
all of which become perfect
animals & have perception &
volition therefore at least the
sentient principle has this
property in common with
matter that it is divisible
then to these difficulties add

decay of the body. As the imbecility
of infancy [insertion]corresponds to[/insertion] [deletion]is marked by[/deletion] the weak
-ness of organisation so the energy
of youth & the power of manhood
are marked by its strength: and the
feebleness and dotage of old age
are in the direct ratio of the
decline of the perception of the
organisation: and the neutral powers
in extreme old age seem destroyed
at the same time with the corporeal

of the frame when the elements
are again restored to that
dead nature from which they were
originally derived. Then there was
a period when the greatest philosopher

existed was a mere living atom

subject & without considering one as a

you are so hostile. [deletion]When the origin[/deletion]

however a gleam of light worth

animal Electricity, its connection

its dependence upon the will

may lead when pursued by ade-

It would be desirable to pursue these
enquiries with the Electricity of the Gym-
notus which is so much more powerful
than that of the Torpedo; but if they
are now to be reasoned upon they
seem to shew a stronger analogy
between common & Animal Elec-
-tricity than between Voltaic &
animal Electricity, but it is is I
think more probable that Ani-
-mal Electricity will be found of
a distinctive and peculiar kind.
Common Electricity is excited upon
non conductors & is readily carried
off by conductors & imperfect
conductors.
Voltaic Electricity is excited upon
combinations of perfect and im-
-perfect conductors & is only trans-
-mitted by perfect conductors or
imperfect conductors of the best
kind -
Magnetism, if it be a form of Elect[superscript]ricity[/superscript]
belongs only to perfect conductors &
in its modification to a particular
class of them.
The animal Electricity resides only in

Electrometer were sufficiently powerful
to be felt in both elbows & once even
in the shoulders.
These negative results may be explained
by supposing that the motion of the
Electricity in the Torpedinal organ is
in no measurable time & that a
current of some contrivance is
necessary to produce the deviation of
the magnetic needle; and found
that the magnetic Electrometer was
eually insensible to the weak
discharge of a Leyden Jar as to
that of the Torpindal organ, tho'
whenever there was a continuous
current from the smallest surfaces
in voltaic combinations of the weak
-est power but which some
chemical action was going on,
it was instantly & powerfully
affected. Two series of Zinc &
Silver & paper moistened in salt
& water caused the permanent
deviation of the needle several
degrees; tho the plates of Zinc were
only 1/6 of an inch in diameter.

[deletion]of[/deletion] in attaining lively & recently
caught Torpedos, one a foot long
the other smaller.
I passed the shocks from the largest
of these animals a number of times
thro' the circuit of an extremely
delicate magnetic Electrometer
(at the same kind but more sensible
than that I have described in my
[otherwork_286]last paper[/otherwork_286] [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]on[/insertion] the Electrochemical
phaenomenal which the Royal Society
has housed with a place in their
Transactions for 1826;) but without per
ceiving the Highest deviation of, or
effect on the needle, & I convinced
myself that the circuit was perfect
by making my body several times
a part of it holding the silver
spoon by which the shock was
taken in one hand wetted in salt
water, & keeping the wire connected
with the electrometer with the other
wet hand, the shocks which passsed
thro the reduplications of the

the charged surfaces were imperfect con-
-ductors such as water, was more
correct than that of the comparison
to the pile; but on mentioning my
researches to Signor Volta with
whom I passed some time at
Milan that summer he shewed
me another form of his instrument
which appeared to him to fulfill
the conditions of the organ of the
Torpedo, - a pile of which the
fluid substance was a very im-
-perfect conductor, such as honey
or a strong, saccharine extract
which required a certain time to
become charged & which did not
decompose water tho' when charged
it communicated weak shocks. -
The discovery of Ørsted at the effects
of the Voltaic Electricity on the mag-
netic needle made me desirous
to ascertain if the electricity of
living animals possessed this
power & after [insertion]several[/insertion] many attempts
to procure living Torpedo suffi-
-ciently strong vigorous to give
powerful shocks, I succeeded in

[page]48||dnp14h046pp|92023224[/page]
without being able to perceive the
slightest decomposition of that fluid,
and I repeated the same experiments
at Mola di Gaeta with an apparatus
in which the smallest possible surface
of silver was exposed in which good
conductors such as solutions of Potassa
& Sulphuric acid were made to connect
the circuit, but with the same negative
results.
Having obtained a large Torpedo
at Rimini in June in the same year
I repeated the experiments using all
the precautions I could imagine
with like results & at the same
time I passed the shock thro' a
very small circuit which was com-
-pleted by a qua[insertion]r[/insertion]ter of an inch of
extermely fine silver wire drawn
by the late Mr Cavendish for using
in the micrometer & which was less
than the 1/1000 of an inch in diameter,
but no ignition of the wire took
place.
It appeared to me after these experi
-ments that the compar[deletion]a[/deletion]ison of the
organ of the Torpedo to an electrical
Battery weakly charged & of which

[page]49||dnp14h047pp|92023225[/page]
which I have just mentioned are
not entirely in harmony with
this view of the subject.
When Volta discovered his wonder-
-ful pile he imagined he had
made [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] perfect resemblance
of the organ of the Gymnotes &
Torpedo & whoever has felt the
shocks of the natural & artificiall
instrument must have been
convinced as far as sensation
is concerned of the strict analogy.
After the discovery of the chemical
power of the Voltaic instrument
I was desirous of ascertaining
if this property of Electricity
was possessed by the electrical
organs of living animals & being
in 1814 & 1816 [insertion]on the coast of the mediterranean[/insertion] I made use of the
opportunities which offered them-
selves of making experiments on
this subject.
Having obtained two lively male
Torpedos in the bay of Naples in
May 1815 I passed the shocks thro'

silver wires through water, &

T R S -
Amidst the variety of researches which
have been pursued respecting the different
forms & modes of excitation and action
of Electricity, it is surprizing to me that
the Electricity of living animals has
not been more an object of attention,
both on account of its physiological
importance of its general relation
 to the science of Electro-Chemistry.
In reading an account of the experiments
of Walsh it is impossible not to be
struck by some peculiarities of the
electricity of the organ of the Torpe-
-do & Gymnotus, such as its want
of powers to pass thro' air & the slight
effects of ignition produced by the
strongest shocks, & tho M[supercript]r[/superscript] . Cavendish
with his usual sagacity compared
its action to that of a battery
weakly charged, - when the electricity
was large in quantity but low
in intensity, yet the peculiarities

tracked his way thro' a suite of apart-

which burned near the bed showed
O'Donohue the countenance of the
Knight which appeared to him much
more ferocious & malignant than it
had ever seemed to him in his waking
hours so true is it that sleep develops
the natural character of the count-
-tenance & destroys the effect of art.
O'Donohue tranquilly withdrew the
vest from his bosom, saw the dagger
which he grasped with the greatest
ardour but in lifting up the dagger
he saw a small chain beneath
which arrested his curiosity. He saw
that it was made of hair & that

the archdruid & again offering his devo-

across the mountains to Ross castle, &
he entered the apartments which were
crowded with Servants who seemed
preparing for a grand festival without
exciting the least attention; he sat
in one of the halls where they were decking
a magnificent table for an entertain

morrow till the crowd began to diminish
& he could not help indulging in the
most melancholy reflexions when he
saw so many persons his dependants
& some of his relatives who had
been under great obligations to him

master & worshiping a new idol,
he contrasted the gratitude and

will fly over the lake but it will be
only to return to Rosscastle & your
existence will then be spent in the vain

state to gain admittance to the apart-

offence and then retired to the secret or
oracular part of the Cromlet where
he remained for some time as if in com-
-munion with an unknown power, he
then came forward & said to O'Donohoe
"Sweno is powerful, Helah is powerful,
but Thor is omnipotent, the enchantment
which thou hast suffered can be destroyed
only in one way, attend carefully to my advice
& pursue it with the utmost caution, Sweno
has long been in love with your wife, she
has hitherto resisted his addresses but now
believing that you are dead she is disposed
to yield to him her person & her heart
Sweno by the arts of his enchantments
has gained the affections of your nobles
& they are disposed to proclaim him king of
Kerry & in a few days he is to be married
to Bertha & crowned in your vacant throne
You must go to Ross castle, you must
find him asleep & you will see in his
bosom a dagger engraved with various
Runic characters, you must take

alliance & his acq[deletion]u[/deletion]aintan with
Sweno he had neglected his religious
duties they now occurred to his mind
as a resource in his misery &
he hoped something from the power
& the counsels of the Druid whom he
had so long neglected, he made his
way to the sacred wood & found the
arch-druid sitting beneath the shade
of the hallowed misseltoe he
rose as O'Donohoe approached &
said "King of Kerry I know you, you
have neglected the Gods of your fathers
& the friends of your youth & have
fallen into the power of Halah
prostrate yourself before the
altar you may yet be preserved &

O'Donohue offered up a most fer-

being who seemed to acknowledge him and
on whom the enchantment appeared to
have no power was his old & faithful
wolfhound Bran, he fawned upon his
master, licked his hands, appeared
as if affected by his condition & fol-
=lowed him as he departed with a
heavy heart from his own door, The half
civilized Irish were at this time
in a very peculiar state as to their re-
-ligion, the opinions of the Druids who
had long been the national priests
were mixed with superstitions de-
-rived from the Scandinavian people
& the ministers of Thor who performed
the rights [insertion]tes[/insertion] of religion were generally
considered as possessed of supernatural
powers & usually combined the triple
character of priest, prophet, and
enchanter, S[superscript]t[/superscript]. Patrick had just
landed in the North of Ireland, but
Christianity had only been heard of

when he beheld the reflexion of his
lineaments. They were entirely
changed but he had gained no super-
-natural strength, no wonderful
power his limbs were shrivelled his
black hair was become silvery grey
& his youthful face was changed into
one of a decrepid & palsied old man.
He with difficulty made his way to the
boat &[deletion]had[/deletion] with still greater difficulty
regained the shore; he was immediately
accosted by the keeper of the boats
who was about to use him with great
violence on account of his effrontry in
making use of one of the royal boats
it was in vain that he declared he was
the master of those boats & the king
himself; the keeper considered him
as a madman & he owed his safety
to the superstition so common in a
rude age & which considers madness
as sacred & as the favourites of
heaven; he made his way to Ross castle
he asked to see the queen but he was
refused admittance & driven from
the door by the servants, the only

To O'Donohue he said, 'You have nothing
now to do but to plunge into the lake
you will come out of it a new being
filled with wisdom & that strength
which will subdue all things to your
purposes lose no time." O'Donohue
rushed forward & precipitated him-
self headlong thro the luminous
atmosphere into the lake. After
this he was wholly insensible [deletion]of[/deletion] to
what had happened to him for many
hours & when he recovered from the
trance into which it appears he
had fallen he found himself cold
wet & shivering upon the side of
the lake. The sun had risen & was
shining upon him in all its brightness
but his limbs appeared cold as ice
Sweno had disappeared. He attempted
to walk towards his boat but found
that his limbs refused to perform
their functions; he looked into the
calm & bright water & what was
his astonishment & horror when

spirits of the elements to share my
power with you, approach me &
give me your hand" O'Donohue
trembled as he approached the won-
derful light with which Sweno
was surrounded yet he slowly ad
-vanced towards him & when he had
entered the luminous atmosphere
which surrounded Sweno he felt an
agreable glow & found his spirits
immediately restored, Sweno gras
ped him by the hand & his touch
appeared almost like that of
burning metal "Follow me; said
Sweno, your initiation shall be
completed he walked a few steps
to the brink of a small lake
carrying with him his atmosphere
of light he walked around the lake
the waters of which became
luminous as he made his circuit
he stopped held up his hand
& with a powerful & awful
voice he exclaimed "Spirits

power which it is my intention to be-

doing this not yet arrived: this
this moment will be announced by a

of [deletion]O'Donohue[/deletion] [insertion]Sweno[/insertion] was so strange & wild
& his countenance had gaine some-
-thing of a supernatural character
so that O'Donohoe could hardly behold
him without experiencing a sensation
of fear & he gladly turned his eyes
from the circle of fire towards heaven
& fixed them upon Jupiter
which was shining with great
brightness above his head; after a
few minutes some soft music was
heard in the air above this was
followed by a loud shout like a
noise of exultation, a light flashed
apparently from the centre of the
sky & fell upon the spot where
Sweno sat who appeared now to
O'Donohoe surrounded by a blaze
of white light & the fire appeared
extinguished "I have recieved

O'Donohoe did not fail to keep this ap-
-pointment taking one of the smallest
boats used for his a[deletion]c[/deletion]quatic amusements
he quietly rowed to the island. It was
a beautiful night, calm & serene
but there was no other light but that
of the planets & stars. O'Donohoe who
had never visited this island at such
a season had some difficulty in finding
the spot indicated by Sweno but as he
approached the centre of the island
he saw in the distance a red & glimering
flame which he made the guide of his
way, when he approached near it he
found it was a fire made by some dry
wood arranged in a circular order
& he saw Sweno sitting on a rock
in the centre of the fire; his fair
countenance & bright hair lighted
up by the reflection of the red light
from the glowing embers. "Come not
nearer to me O'Donohoe" exclaimed
Sweno, "the spirits of the elements
command within this circle & you
would be torn into pieces if you
attempted to pass the boundary of

[page]66||dnp14h064pp|92023242[/page]
& their relationship by marriage to
make him the partaker of that knowledge
which bestowed so much power Sweno
did not at first seem to favour O'Donohue's
wishes, spoke of the greatness of the boon
he demanded which when given could
not be taken away & seemed to require
some compensation for conferring so
great a benefit. O'Donohue was profuse
in his offers of rewards to Sweno, pro-
posed to divide his kingdom with him or to
establish Limerick in a separate prin
-cipality for him in short to do whatever
he desired. Sweno's consent appeared won
by his importunity & he said to O'Donohoe
"I select you because I love you to be
a partner in the power that I now
possess alone & to give you the means
of commanding for the rest of your
life a prosperity & glory belonging
to no other mortal, meet me [deletion]this[/deletion]
at midnight in the island of Mucrish
but come unattended, you will find me
sitting on a rock at the small
[insertion]lake[/insertion] [deletion]spring[/deletion] surrounded by willows which
is exactly in the centre of the island."

elements are under the power of peculiar spiritual
essences or beings who are capable by particular
rites & ceremonies of being influenced by &
made subservient to the destinies of man
In my [insertion]early[/insertion] youth I was acquainted with a Lap-
land seer in whose cell I passed many
nights of severe & terrible discipline & with
hard study, vigils, & by severe penance I obtained
knowledge which renders me far superior
to other men but this knowledge which
I so hardly gained i can easily com-
-municate but I have the power of im-
-parting it only to one person & to him
if properly applied it will be a source of
blessing & of happiness it makes its posses
-sor invincible & may consequently be
used for unworthy purposes of conquest
or ambition but such is its nature
that if once misapplied it is lost for
ever, The genius of the elements who
serves me will only be obedient to good"
O'Donohue was very much astonished
by this confession of Sweno & urged
him by arguments derived from
the friendship which he bore him, the
confidence which he had reposed in him,

[page]68||dnp14h066pp|92023244[/page]
& the easy conquest which he made of the hero
Connor & so large a body of veteran warriors
was attributed to magic it was said more over
that there were peculiar Runic characters
marked upon his shield & that he had been
observed at midnight on the island of
Mucrish sitting by a fire of his own
kindling & that on this occasion unearthly
forms were seen flitting round him,
unearthly voices heard & music which ap-
-peared of another world. These rumours
reached the ear of O'Donohue who attended but
little to them & only mentioned them to his
queen she did not treat them so slightly as
O'Donohoe had expected but said, "my cousin is
unfairly a wonderful man & even at
the court of my father was always supposed
to be under the influence of a goad spirit
or genius who gave to him powers which he
has always used for the best & most bene-
-volent purposes. Speak to him yourself on
this subject." O'Donohoe followed her advice
& took the first opportunity that occured
of mentioning what he had heard to Sweno
"Common rumour" Sweno said smiling is in
this instance, a very rare one, correct, the

possession of the domains of O'Shaugnissy
Proposals for peace were exchanged be-
-fallen the contending parties O'Donohue
generously gave up the town of Limerick
& part of the surrounding territory to O'
Shaugnissy & by the advice of Sweno enter-
-ed into the solemn pact with the Kings
of Ulster & Connaught never to pass
the Barrow with any forces, to limit
the number of his army, & to attempt
no new plans of conquest. Peace being
reestablished O'Donohue with Sweno re-
-turned to the queen at Killarney. his
confidence in Sweno reestablished & if
possible increased by the late events &
the whole party appeared as happy as
Success love & friendship could make
them but rumours had spread amongst
the soldiers of O'Donohue that Sweno
did not owe his peculiar power [deletion]of[/deletion] &
success in combat to mere human means
but that he was supernaturally gifted.
Stories were current that his cream
-coloured charger had been seen to
emit flames of fire from his nostrils
on the day of his triumph in the field

[page]70||dnp14h068pp|92023246[/page]
killed members of the enemy with his
own single hand & had nearly made his
way with a chosen band of heroes thro'
their line when he was arrested by Connor
the hero of Ulster. A furious battle
immediately commenced between those
two champions; the King of Kerry was
struck from his horse wounded & was
about to render himself prisoner when
loud shouts in the distance were heard
the noise of trumpets & the neighing of
horses [insertion]announced the arrival of[/insertion] a large body of caval[deletion]e[/deletion]ry & arres-
-ted the triumph of the Ulstermen &
O'Donohue recognised Sweno at the head
of them, his long flaxen locks floating
down his shoulders & his animated pre-
-sence & triumphant air giving him
the character of the Genius of Victory
Nothing could withstand his attack,
Connor fell in the field under his tri-
-umphant arm. O'Donohues scattered
bands rallied under him, the men
of Kerry were every where successful
& in a few days Kerry was entirely
cleared of the Ulster & Connaught
kernes & O'Donohoe reinstated in the

[page]71||dnp14h069pp|92023247[/page]
refuge in the mountains of Kerry: he
had sent messenger after messenger to
Sweno who remained with a part of his
army at Killarney & received always
the same answer that he was imme-
-diately about to join him & that his
delay arose only from his levying new
forces to ensure his triumph O'Donohoe
was now in a miserable situation, he
was hemmed in on all sides by his
enemies & obliged to take his stand
on the fortified mountain of Innesmoor
where he was in danger of perishing
for want of provisions unless indeed he
preferred the [deletion]dangerous[/deletion] [insertion]perilous[/insertion] alternative
of fighting with his enemies under
great disadvantages of situation &
number. This his last resource he
was at length compelled to adopt
& bringing all his martial Kerry=
=men to [deletion]bare[/deletion] [insertion]bear[/insertion] upon the weakest part
of the ennemies line he attempted
to cut his way thro' it on the pass
of Dunglo which opens on Killarney
The combat was furious & bloody,
O'Donohoe fought with great bravery

[page]72||dnp14h070pp|92023248[/page]
at Killarney. Meanwhile the independent
chieftains of Connaught & Ulster did
not see with indifference O'Donohoe's
extension of his territory, considering
his first attempt as the commencement
of a plan for the subjugation of the whole
of Ireland they held councils raised
numerous levies appointed Connor a
brave warrior the son of the King
of Ulster to the command of their
united forces & sent heralds to O'Donohoe
stating that unless he would immedi-
=ately set O'Shaughnissy at liberty
& put him again in possession of his
territories they would [deletion]immediately[/deletion] [insertion]directly[/insertion]
commence hostilities against him
O'Donohoe confiding in the strength of
his army & the courage & skill of
Sweno sent an angry reply to the
assembled chieftains & war was the
immediate consequence: he at first
gained some slight successes but
being opposed by almost the whole
strength of Ireland these successes
were transient & he was soon driven
back from Limerick & obliged to take

[page]73||dnp14h071pp|92023249[/page]
So a foreigner had not escaped the
notice of some of O'Donohoe's oldest
& wisest counsellors; one of them
who held the highest place in his esteem
named O'Brien had remonstrated with
his chief on the impolicy of his conduct
& had particularly pointed out the
impropriety of trusting the young
queen to the escort of so handsome,
so agreable & so enterprizing a relative,
but O'Donohoe was deaf to these repre-
=sentations placing unlimited confidence
in Sweno. Sweno did not return with
the queen so soon as was expected
but O'Donohoe received the most
tender letters from the queen pointing
out a slight indisposition as one cause
of the delay & as another the necessity
of appearing by her presence some
slight discontents which appeared in
the western part of Kerry. The
King was satisfied with these excuses
& as the first offered hints that the queen
was in a state likely to provide his
kingdom with an heir he was contented
that she should remain some time longer

of some dependents in these
rude times & [deletion]Sweno[/deletion] the King
marched with his army
into the heart of [deletion]Ger[/deletion] the
country He was desirous
of [deletion]possessing[/deletion] [insertion]conquering[/insertion] made himself
Master of Limerick &
gained possession of the
Person of the Chief whom
He had attacked. -
After this it became easy to subjugate
the undisciplined Kernes that still offered
resistance & in a few months his conquest
of the territory of O'Shaughnissy was
completed. Sweno advised him to re-
-main sometime at Limerick for
the purpose of conciliating the affection
of his new subjects & by his command
returned to Killarney [deletion]for[/deletion] with a
numerous suite for the purpose of
escorting Bertha in state to her
husband: the danger of entrusting
so much power over the army

[page]75||dnp14h073pp|92023251[/page]
73
& by his conciliatory manners great
affability & magnificence in giving
entertainments & presents for he seemed
both rich & liberal he gained the affections
of most of O'Donohues dependants & became
the idol of the officers of the army.
In his preceding life O'Donohoe
had never appeared ambitious;
but when He renewed his
well disciplined forces & saw
how filled they were for
military enterprise he began
to conceive plans of increasing
his territory & yielded to
the advice of Sereno who
advised him to attempt
the conquest of the western
part of Connaught then
under an independent chief.
A pretext for war was
easily found in the quarrels

he performed all martial exercises
O'Donohoe had the dark locks, [deletion]and[/deletion]
[deletion]swart[/deletion] black eyes & swarthy com
plexion which marked his descent
from a southern race, His queen
was fair but had auburn air
& darker eyes than are common
to the Scandinavian people. Swenos
complexion was still fairer than
that of his cousin: his eyes were
bright blue and his hair so [deletion]light[/deletion] [insertion]light[/insertion]
a flaxen colour as to be almost
[deletion]th[/deletion] [insertion]so[/insertion] & [deletion]that[/deletion] it was scarcely pos-
sible to see three persons when they
sat together at table more striking
-ly contrasted. Sweno soon became as
great a favourite with O'Donahoo
as he was with [deletion]his queen Bertha[/deletion]
He was consulted by him in all
affairs of state employed by
him to train & discipline his
forces & at last accepted a
command under the king as
general of his army. His

native Irish. He employed
himself in a manner well
becoming a good sovereign in
improving the conditions of his sub-
-jects & in administering justice
& The conduct of the queen was the
object of imitations of the wives of
his higher vassals. In the suite
of the queen there came from
Norway a very remarkable per.
:son; he was considered as the
nephew of the king of Norway,
& was one of her principal
friends & confidants but the
intimacy between them appeared
no greater than might well
exist between such near re.
:lations & O'Donohoo had willingly
invited him to remain the guest
of his cousin at Kilarney. The
name of the Norwegian was
Sweno he was remarkable for
the elegance of his person for
great strength & activity
& for the grace with which

[page]78||dnp14h076pp|92023254[/page]
which the nobles were called by

the whole of Munster [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]below[/insertion] the

his Knights & immediate vassals
an army of not less than 20.000
men. The most powerful & rich
among the native princes of
Ireland he considered no one [insertion]of them[/insertion] as
worthy of forming an alliance
with him & he sailed with a
considerable fleet to Norway for
the purpose of demanding in
marriage the eldest daughter
of the king of that country [insertion]called Bertha[/insertion]
a lady remarkable for her
charms: his proposals were accep-
-ted & he brought his bride to Kerry
accompanied by a numerous suite

The Chief who embarked in this

Halius. My experience is entirely
on the opposite side & once I saw
a distinguished craniologist in
error on a point which he considered
as the most decided. He was shown
two children, one of whom was
possessed of great mathematical
acquirements, the other of extra-
ordinary [deletion]physical[/deletion] [insertion]musical[/insertion] taste. With
the utmost confidence he pro-
-nounced judgement & was mista-
=ken, it appeared to me that whilst
he was examining the two heads
he hummed an air, which being
out of tune was not responded to
by the musical child, but some-
how struck the fancy of the
mathematical one.

in the skulls of distinguished archi-
tects; now the skull of the beaver is
so formed that he is able to use his
jaws for cutting down the trees with
which he makes his dam. & if this
analogy were correct the architect
ought unquestionably to employ his
teeth for the same purposes, and
tho' I have known distinguished
men who have been in the habit
of using knives for cutting furniture
with a sort of nervous restlessness of
hand, I do not recollect to have heard
of the teeth being employed in the
same way, & I think it would be
quite as correct to find the architect-
-ural or constructive organ in the
opposite part of the body, the tail
as the beaver makes a more in-
-genious use of this part than
even of his mouth. Pray have
you ever observed Poietes any
particular protuberance in
the nether parts of any of
our distinguished architects?

much of this quality as the most
ferocious royal tyger. Courage is
the result of strong passions or strong
motives, & in man it usually re-
=sults from the love of glory or the
fear of shame & it appears to me
a perfectly absurd idea that of
connecting it with an organ, which
is merely intended to assist the pre-
-datory habits & the mastication
of a carnivorous animal-.
Hal: I agree with Physicus in
this view of the subject. I once
heard a Physiologist of some re.
-putation deducing an arguement
in favour of Craniology from the
form of the skull of the beaver
which he called a constructive
animal & contended that there was
something of the same character

in favour of this long agitated & generally
unpopular doctrine -
Physicus. In my opinion it offers
like most of the facts which have been
brought forward to prove the truths of
the view of [person_074]Gall[/person_074] & Spurzheim, an ar-
-gument rather unfavourable, when
thoroughly & minutely examined.
Poietes. How ?
Physicus. In these rapacious & predatory
animals the organization of the

functions of the jaws as the con

be related to the use of the fore leg,

[underline]Addition to Salmonia[/underline]
[underline]on the crossing the breeds[/underline]
[underline]of fishes.-[/underline]
[underline]Poetes.[/underline] So much science would
be required to make those experi-
ments with success & [deletion]I fear[/deletion] there
would be so many difficulties
in the way of preserving fishes at the
time they are proper for reproduc-
-tion that I fear very few country
gentleman would be capable of prose-
-cuting this inquiry.
[underline]Hal.[/underline] The science required for this
object is easily attained & the
difficulties are quite imaginary
The impregnation of the ova of fishes
is performed out of the body & it is
only necessary to pour the seminal
liquor from the milt upon the ova
in water. Mr. Jacobi a german
gentleman who [deletion]has[/deletion] made many
[insertion]years ago[/insertion] experiments on the increase of trout

[page]98||dnp14h096pp|92023274[/page]
& salmon informs us that the ova & milt
[deletion]even of fish[/deletion] of mature fish recently
dead will produce living offspring-
This plan of raising trout from [deletion]ova[/deletion]
the egg was a very simple one, He
had a box made with a small wire gra
ting [deletion]in the ova[/deletion] at one end in the
cover for admitting water from [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion]
fresh source or stream & at the other
end of the [deletion]bottom[/deletion] [insertion]side[/insertion] of the box there
were a number of holes to permit
the exit of the water. The bottom
of the box was filled the pebbles
& gravel of different sizes which
were [deletion]always[/deletion] kept covered with water
that were always in motion. In Novem
=ber or the beginning of December
when the trout were in full maturity
for spawning & collected in the
rivers for this purpose upon beds
of gravel he caught males & females

[page]99||dnp14h097pp|92023275[/page]
97
in a net & by the pressure of his hands
received the ova in a basin of water &
suffused the milt or seminal fluid in the
same manner to pass into the [deletion]same[/deletion]
basin & after they had remained a few
minutes together he introduced [insertion]them[/insertion] upon
the gravel in the box which was placed
under a source of fresh cool & pure
water. In a few weeks the eggs burst
& the box was filled with an immense
number of young trouts which had a
small bag attached to the lower part
of their body containing [insertion]a part of[/insertion] the yolk[deletion]e[/deletion]
of the egg which was still their
nourishment. In this state they were
easily carried from place to place
[deletion]&[/deletion] in confined portion of [insertion]fresh[/insertion] water for
some days requiring no food, but after
about a week the nourishment in
their bag being exhausted they began
& seek their food in the water
& rapidly increased in size. As I

[page]100||dnp14h098pp|92023276[/page]
have said before Mr Jacobi aprises
us that the experiment succeeded
as well with mature fish that had
been killed for the purpose of
procuring the roe & milt, they
having been mixed together in cold
water immediately after they were
taken out of the body. I have had
this experiment tried twice & with
perfect success & it offers a very
good mode of increasing to any ex-
-tent the quantity of trout in
rivers of lakes for the [deletion]fish[/deletion] [insertion]young ones[/insertion] are
preserved from the attacks of
fishes & other voracious animals
or insects at [deletion]at[/deletion] the time when they
are most easily destroyed & [deletion]when[/deletion]
[deletion]they are[/deletion] perfectly helpless. The
same plan I have no doubt
would answer equally well
with Grayling or other varieties

[page]101||dnp14h099pp|92023277[/page]
99
of the Salmo Genus, but in all experi-
=ments of this kind the great principle
is to have a constant current of
fresh & [deletion]aererted[/deletion] [insertion]aerated[/insertion] water running
over the eggs. The [deletion]constant[/deletion] [insertion]uniform[/insertion] supply
of air to the foetus in the egg is essen-
-tial for its life & growth & those eggs
not supplied with water saturated with
air are unproductive. The experimen
=ter [insertion]ter[/insertion] must be exactly guided by the in-
-tinct of the parent fishes who
take care to deposit the impreg-
-nated eggs that are to produce their
offspring only in sources continually
abounding in fresh & aerated water.
[underline]Phys.[/underline] But as every species of fish has a
particular & sexually different time
for spawning I do not see how it could
be contrived to cross their breeds
or how the ova of a trout which
spawns in December could be
impregnated by the seminal

[page]102||dnp14h100pp|92023278[/page]
fluid of the Grayling which spawns
in May for I conclude it would be
impossible to preserve the eggs of
a fish out of the body in a state
in which they could retain or recover
their vitality-
[underline]Hal.[/underline] I believe I mentioned before
that I had found instances in which
the ova of fish were develloped
at a different period from their
natural one & I have no doubt that
[deletion]with[/deletion] a little inquiry respecting
the habits of fishes would enable us
to acquire a knowledge of the cir-
=cumstances which either hasten
or retard their maturity. Plenty
of good & a genial season hasten the
period of their reproduction which
is delayed by want of proper
nourishment & by unfavourable

[page]103||dnp14h101pp|92023279[/page]
101
weather. Males & females likewise
confined from each other have
their generative powers impeded
& trout, grayling & salmon will
not deposit their ova except in
running water so that by keeping
them in tanks the period of their
maturity might be considerably
altered. I have seen char [insertion]even[/insertion] which
had been kept in confined water
from September till July & so
slow had been progress of the
ova that they appeared [insertion]to be[/insertion] about
this time fit for exclusion tho
in the natural course of things they
would have been ripe in the end of
October of the year before. By atten
-ding to & controlling all these circum
-stances I have no doubt many inter
-esting experiments might be made
as to the possibility of modifying
the varieties of the Salmo by impreg

[page]104||dnp14h102pp|92023280[/page]
=nating the ova of one species [insertion]with[/insertion] [deletion]by[/deletion]
the seminal fluid of another [deletion]and[/deletion]
With fishes of other genera the task
would be still more easy. Carp,
perch or pike deposit their ova in
still water in spring & summer
when it is supplied with air by
the growth of vegetables & it is [deletion]to[/deletion] on
the leaves of plants which afford
a continual supply of oxygen
to the water that the the impregnated
eggs usually adhere so that re[deletion]s[/deletion]-
searches of this kind might be
conducted withindoors in close
vessels filled with plants ex-
-posed to the Sun. I have myself
kept minnows [insertion]& sticklebacks[/insertion] alive for many
months in the same confined
quantity of water containing
a few confervae & their ova &
milt increased in the same manner

I remember in 1809 having
a long conversation with the
late D[superscript]r[/superscript] Jenner on the habits
of animals. He was always
original & ingenious but I
think was sometimes carried
too far by the remoteness of
his analogies. We were dis
-cussing the possibility of the
uses of earthworms to man
I was [deletion]rather[/deletion] more disposed
to consider the dung hill &
putrefaction as useful to the
worm rather than the worm as
an agent important to man
in the economy of nature.

[page]109||dnp14h107pp|92023285[/page]
107
but D[superscript]r[/superscript] Jenner would not
allow my reason he said
The earthworms particularly
about the time of the vernal
equinox move much under
& along the surface of our
moist meadow lands
wherever they move they
leave a trail of mucous be
=hind them which becomes
a manure to the plant. In
this respect they act as the slug
does in furnishing materials
for food to the vegetable King
=dom & under the surface they
break stiff clods in pieces &
finely divide the soil. They feed
likewise entirely on inorganic ma

than the tyrants of the vegetable
system- Feb 28

you an idea of the train of argument
I intend to pursue when I say that you
might as well expect by taking a
puppy from a wild esquimaux dog &
educating & training him as a pointer
to give him the peculiar habits & ex-
=cellencies of a highly finished animal of
that superior race he would no more
gain the habits of the pointer however
severe the discipline to which he had been
submitted & however great the pains taken
in his training than he would gain the
form of the pointer or change his dense
shaggy hair for the smooth & sleek skin
of the cultivated animals
On. This form of argument does appear
to me [insertion]to be[/insertion] ridiculous: you might almost
as well knock me down as a reasoner
by saying that the moral and intellect
-ual qualities of the Tartar could no
more change by cultivation than his
physical ones & it would be as easy
to raise his flat nose to the height
of the purest grecian model as to
exalt his gross mind to the refine
=ments & powers of a philosopher.

[page]112||dnp14h110pp|92023288[/page]
moral circumstance of conexion, society &
station favourable to the attainment of
superiority; do you not think this Tartar
would be exactly the same as an english
infant brought up in the same manner and
exposed to the same circumstances, he
derived from his tartar peasants mind
the susceptibility of sensation of all that
can become intellect & what more could he
have had, had this father been a Newton
& his mother a Mad[superscript]me[/superscript] de Stael.
Phil. You have put a strong case but it
is precisely the one which I should like
to examine, I say in a most unequivocal
manner that your educated Tartar would
in spite of all the advantages of civiliza-
-tion & [deletion]of education[/deletion] [insertion]discipline[/insertion] still be a savage
tho one of the most extraordinary kind
& that he never could exert the intellectual
powers or attain the mental prominence
-nence which your english child of
healthy organization & descended
from enlightened parents under the
same circumstance would naturally
possess; it may appear at first to
ridiculous but it will at least give

On. There are many, but for the articles
of faith I shall call on Amb: for
assistance, but there is one pure speculative
opinion on which I am disposed to
combat with your Genius, that in which
it is asserted that particular intellectual
powers or qualities are hereditary
Phil. In this combat I shall not fear to
meet you on the part of the Genius, &
to defend what you consider I suppose
as poetical reverie in the character of a
profound philosophical truth
On. I will suppose that the [deletion]parent[/deletion] child of a
Tartar peasant has been taken from
his mother at a month old, suckled
by a healthy & well educated english-
woman & brought up with all the care
that can be bestowed upon an infant
intended for intellectual excellence.
I will imagine him under a severe &
unremitting discipline instructed in
the principles of science, I will imagine
the love of glory created in his mind
& supported from the purest & most
inexhaustible sources, & all the

Dialogue on the qualities which
may be considered as hereditary,
or on what may be called blood in
man & other animals.-
The characters are the same as in

Onuphrio & Philalethes.-
O. [deletion]A[/deletion] We have discussed some of the objects
alluded to in your miraculous vision
Philalethes, but there are a number of
others open to examination & in my
opinion without foundation. I con-
sider the Genius rather as the poeti-
-cal than the philosophical represen-
-titive of your opinions for you are
a sound reasoner, & cannot I think
mean to defend some of the views
which you attribute to this su-
-perior nature.

of truth as you can be & shall

but the resemblance was so awful & unnatural
that I endeavoured to withdraw my view from
them; You are now said the Genius in a
cometary system, those globes of light sur-
-rounding you are material forms such as
in one of your systems of religious faith
have been attributed to seraphs, they
live in that element which to you
would be destructive they communicate
by powers which would convert your
organized frame into ashes, they are
now in the height of their enjoyment

of the solar atmosphere", [deletion]The low[/deletion]
[deletion]& sweet voice ceased; I appeared [insertion]finish[/insertion] as[/deletion]
[deletion]if I had fallen suddenly upon[/deletion]
[deletion]the earth but there was a bright[/deletion]
[deletion]light before me & I heard my[/deletion]
[deletion]name loudly called; the voice[/deletion]
[deletion]was not of my intellectual guide,[/deletion]
[deletion]the Genius before me was my servant[/deletion]
[deletion]bearing a flambeau in his hand, he[/deletion]
[deletion]told me he had been searching me in[/deletion]
[deletion]vain amongst the ruins, that the[/deletion]

from the diversity of circumstances to
which they are exposed passing as it
were thro the infinity of space they are
continually gratified by sight of
new systems & worlds & you can
imagine the unbounded nature of the
wide of their knowledge. My power
extends so far as to afford you a
glimpse of the nature of a cometary
world". I was again in rapid motion
again passing with the utmost velocity
thro the bright & blue sky I saw
Jupiter & his satellites & Saturn &
his ring behind me & before me the
sun no longer appearing as thro a blue
mist but in bright & unsupportable
splendour towards which I seemed moving
with the utmost velocity; [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
in a limit[deletion]t[/deletion]ed sphere of vision in a kind
of red hazy light similar to that which
first broke in upon me in the Colisseum
[deletion]&[/deletion] I saw moving round me globes which
appeared composed of different kinds of
flame but of various colours, in some of
those globes I recognised figure which put
me in mind of the human countenance

[page]118||dnp14h116pp|92023294[/page]
therefore that pass from system to system
in progression towards powers & knowledge
preserve at least this on invariable
character & their intellectual life may
be said to depend more or less upon
the influence of light [deletion]as[/deletion] As far as my
knowledge extends even in other worlds
the more perfect organized systems
still possess their source of sensation
& of enjoyment but with higher natures
finer & more etherial kinds of matter

or most subtle gazes do to common
solids & fluids: The universe is every
where full of life but the modes of
this life are infinitely diversified
& yet every form of it must be enjoyed

You have seen the comet moving

intellectual beings inferior indeed to
those belonging to the atmosphere of
Saturn but yet possessed of an extensive
range of sensations & endowed with
extraordinary power & intelligence.
I could transport you to the different
planets & show you in each pecu:
-liar intellectual beings bearing a-
nalogies to each other but yet all
different in power & essence. In
Jupiter you would see creatures
similar to those in Saturn but
with different powers of locomotion
in Mars & in Venus you would find
races of created forms more analogous
to those belonging to the earth but
in every part of the planetary system
you would find one character peculiar
to all intelligent natures, a sense of
receiving impressions from light
by various organs of vision & towards
this result you cannot but per-
-cieve that that all the arrangements
& motions of the planetary bodies
their satellites & atmospheres are
subservient. The spiritual natures

[page]120||dnp14h118pp|92023296[/page]
Art & processes are going on in them con-
-nected with the formation & pertection
of their food the brilliant coloured fluids
which you see are results of such operations
as on the earth would be performed in
your laboratories or more properly in your
refined culinary [insertion]apparatus[/insertion] [deletion]operations[/deletion] for they
are connected with their system of
 nourishment. Those opaque azure clouds
to which you saw a few minutes ago
one of these beings directing his course
are works of Art & places in which
they move thro different regions of
their atmosphere & command the
temperature & the quantity of light
most fitted for their philosophical re-
-searches or most convenient for the
purposes of life. On the verge of the
visible horizon which we believe a-
-round us you may see in the east
a very dark spot or shadow in which
the light of the sun seems entirely
absorbed, this is the border of an
immense mass of liquid analogous
to your ocean but unlike your
sea it is inhabited by a race of

[page]121||dnp14h119pp|92023297[/page]
119
history for the same time is as correct
as their astronomical one. As I can-
not describe to you the organs of these
wonderful beings so [deletion]&[/deletion] neither can I show
to you their modes of life, but as their
pursuits, so you may conclude that these
highest pleasures depend upon intellectual
modes of life b[deletion]e[/deletion]are the strictest analogy to
that which on the earth you would call
[deletion]strictly virtuous conduct[/deletion] [insertion]exalted virtue[/insertion] I will tell
you however that they have no wars
& that the objects of their ambition are en-
-tirely those of intellectual greatness & that
the only passion that they feel in which
comparisons with each other can be in-
=stituted are those dependent upon a
love of glory of the purest kind. If I
were to show you the different parts of the
surface of this planet you would see marve-
-lous results of the powers possessed by
these highly intellectual beings, &
of the wonderful manner in which
they have applied & modified mat-
-ter those columnar masses which
seem to you as if arising out of a
mass of ice below are results of

[page]122||dnp14h120pp|92023298[/page]
your astronomical history is so imper
-fect are to them perfectly familiar &
in their ephemerides their places are
shown with as much correctness as
those of Jupiter or Venus in your
almanacks: the parallax of the fixed
star [insertion]nearest them[/insertion] is as well understood [deletion]with respect[/deletion]
[deletion]to those nearest to them[/deletion] as that of their
own sun & they possess a magnificent
history of the changes taking place in
the heavens & which are governed by
laws that it would be vain for me
to attempt to give you an idea of; they
are acquainted with [insertion]the revolutions &[/insertion] the uses of comets,
they understand the system of those
meteoric formations of stones which
have so much astonished you on
the earth & they have histories in which
the gradual changes of nebulae in their
progress towards systems have been
registered so that they can predict their
future changes: & their astronomical
records are not like yours which go
back only 20 Centuries to the time
of Heparchus, they embrace a period
a hundred times as long & their civil

[page]123||dnp14h121pp|92023299[/page]
121
they have been enabled to determine
the laws belonging to the solar system
with far more accuracy than you
can possibly concieve & any one of those
beings could show you what is now
the situation & appearance of your
moon with a precision that might induce
you to believe that he saw it tho it
[insertion]his knowledge is[/insertion] is merely the result of calculation.
Their sources of pleasure are of the highest
intellectual nature. With the magnificent
spectacle of their own rings & moons
revolving round them with the various
combinations required to understand &
pr[insertion]e[/insertion]dict the relations of these wonder-
-ful phanomena, their minds are in
unceasing activity & this activity is
a perpetual source of enjoyment, Your
view of the solar system is bounded by
Uranus & the laws of this planet form
the ultimatum of your mathemati-
-cal results but these beings catch
a sight of planets belonging to an-
-other system & even reason on
the phaenomena presented by an-
other sun. Those comets of which

[page]124||dnp14h122pp|92023300[/page]
imperfect in their function [insertion]2[/insertion] & not unlike in
their organisations [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] the zoophytes of the polar
sea [insertion]to which they are[/insertion] have a sphere of sensibility & intellectual
enjoyment far superior to that of the inhabitants
of your earth; each of those tubes which
appear like the trunk of an elephant is
an organ of peculiar motion or sensation
They have many modes of perception of
which you are wholly ignorant at the
same time that their sphere of vision is
infinitively more extended than yours,
& their organ of touch far more perfect &
exquisitte, they pass from place to place thro
the atmosphere & their powers of locomotion
consequently are far superior to yours, it
would be useless for me to attempt to ex-
-plain their organisation which you could
never understand but of their intellectual
objects of pursuit I may perhaps give
you some notion; they have used modified
and applied the material world in a
manner analogous to man, but with
far superior powers they have gained su
-perior results, their atmosphere being
much denser than your & the speci
-fic gravity of their planet less [deletion]dense[/deletion]

place to place by six extremely thin
membranes [deletion]in[/delection] which they used as wings,
their colours were varied & beautiful but
principally azure & rose colour. I saw [deletion]various[/deletion]
[insertion]numerous[/insertion] convolutions of tubes more analogous to the
trunk of the elephant than to anything
else I can imagine occupying what I
supposed to be the upper part of the body
& my feeling of astonishment almost
became one of disgust from the peculiar
character of [insertion]the organs of[/insertion] these singular being [deletion]belonging[/deletion]
[deletion]to Saturn[/deletion] & it was with a species of terror
that I saw one of them mounting [deletion]towards[/deletion]
[deletion]me[/deletion] [insertion]upward[/insertion] apparently flying [insertion]towards[/insertion] [deletion]in the direction of[/deletion]
[deletion]myself[/deletion] those opaque clouds which I have
before mentioned. I know what your
feelings are, said the Genius you want
analogies & all the elements of knowledge
to comprehend the scene before you; you
are in the same state in which a fly
would be whose microscopic eye was
changed for one similar to that of man
& [deletion]who is[/deletion] [insertion]you are[/insertion] wholy unable to associate what

[page]126||dnp14h124pp|92023302[/page]
I was again in motion & again almost
as suddenly at rest. I saw below me a
[deletion]surface[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]scene[/deletion] surface[/insertion] infinitely diversified [deletion]but which[/deletion] 
 [deletion]gave me the idea more[/deletion]  [insertion]something[/insertion] like that of an
immense glacier covered with large colum=
-nar masses which appeared as if formed
of glass & from which were suspended
rounded forms of various sizes which if
they had not been transparent I might have
supposed to be fruit; from what appeared to
me to be analogous to [insertion]masses of bright blue ice[/insertion] [deletion]glaciers below[/deletion] streams
of the [insertion]richest[/insertion] [deletion]brightest[/deletion] tint of [insertion]rose-colour or purple[/insertion] [deletion]the budding rose[/deletion]
 burst forth & flowed [deletion]towards[/deletion] into [deletion]a[/deletion] basins
forming [deletion]a[/deletion] lakes or seas of the same colour.

of an azure colour [insertion]that[/insertion] [deletion]which[/deletion] reflected the
light of the sun which had to my organs
an entirely new aspect & appeared smaller
& as if seen thro a dense [insertion]blue[/insertion] mist. I saw
moving on the surface below me immense
masses the form of which I find it im-
-possible to describe; they had systems
for locomotion similar to those of the
mouse or seahorse but I saw with
great surprize that they moved from

express a wish that he could see it-
It seemed as if I was on the verge of

of light now appeared to pause I again
heard the low & sweet voice of the
Genius which said "You are now on
the verge of your own system,
will you go further or return to

least before I return the glimpse
which you promise me of those
superior intellectual natures & the
modes of their being & their enjoyments
There are [insertion]said the Genius [deletion]beings[/deletion] [insertion]Creatures[/insertion] as superior to any idea
your imagination can form, in that part of
the system now before you comprehending
[insertion]Saturn[/insertion] his moons & rings, I will carry you to
the verge of the immense atmosphere of
This planet. In that space you will see
sufficient to wonder at & far more than
with your present organisation it would
be possible for me to make you understand

earth & I gradually mounted into the
bright & luminous air leaving behind
me the dark & cold cavern & the ruins
with which it was strewed; language is
inadequate to describe what I felt in
rising continually upwards thro this
bright & luminous atmosphere I had
not as is generally the case with per
=sons in dreams of this kind imagined to
myself wings but I rose gradually
& securely as if I were myself a
part of the ascending column of light
[deletion]gradually[/deletion] [insertion]by degrees[/insertion] this luminous atmosphere
which was diffused over the whole
of space become more circumscribed
& [deletion]cent[/deletion] extended only to a limi[deletion]t[/deletion]ted [deletion]space[/deletion]
[insertion]spot[/insertion] around me, I saw thro' it the bright
blue sky, the moon & stars, & I
passed by them as if it were in
my power to touch them with my hand
I [deletion]saw[/deletion] [insertion]beheld[/insertion] Jupiter & Saturn as they
appear thro' our best telescopes but
still more magnified, all the moons
& belts of Jupiter being perfectly
distinct & the double ring of Saturn
appearing in that [deletion]form[/deletion] state in

now in a higher & better state of
[insertion]planetary[/insertion] existence drinking intellectual light
from a purer source & approaching
nearer to the infinite & divine mind
but follow me & [deletion]I[/deletion] you shall at
least catch a glimpse of those states
which the highest intellectual beings
that have belonged to the earth enjoy
after death in their transition to new
& more exalted natures." The voice
ceased & I appeared to be in a dark
deep & cold cave of which the walls
of the Colisseum formed the boundary
from above a bright and rosy light
broke into this cave so that whilst
below all was dark above all was
bright & illuminated with glory.
I seemed possessed at this moment of
a new sense & felt that the light
brought with it a genial warmth-
odourus, like those of the most balmy
flowers appeared to fill the air &
the sweetest sounds of music absor-
-bed my sense of hearing, my limbs
had a new lightness given to them
so that I seemed to rise from the

[page]130||dnp14h128pp|92023306[/page]
from one part of the universe to another
by laws entirely independent of those of
motion: The quantity or the number of
spiritual essences like that of the quantity
or number of the atoms of the material
world are always the same but their
arrangement like those of the materials
which they are destined to guide or
govern are infinitely diversified; they
are in fact parts more or less superior
of the infinite mind and in the plane
-tary systems [insertion]to one[/insertion] of which this globe that
you inhabit [deletion]is one[/deletion] [insertion]belongs[/insertion] are in a state of
probation continually aiming at &
rising to a higher state of existence
were in permitted to me to extend
[deletion]My[/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] visions to the fates of individual
existences I could show you the same
spirit which in the form of Socrates
develloped the foundations of moral
& social virtue in [deletion]Galileo discovering[/deletion] [insertion]the Czar Peter[/insertion]
[insertion]possessed of supreme [deletion]determining[/deletion] power[/insertion]
[deletion]new worlds & develloping the laws[/deletion]
[insertion]& enjoying exalted felicity in improving a rude people[/insertion
[deletion]of their motion[/deletion], I could show you
that monad or spirit which with
the organs of Newton displayed an
intelligence almost above humanity

[page]131||dnp14h129pp|92023307[/page]
129
and if the quantity of life is increased,
the quantity of happiness particularly
that resulting from the exercise of
intellectual power is increased in a
still higher ration; now you will
say is mind generated? is spiritual
power created? or are those results de-
=pendant upon the organisation of
matter upon new perfections given to
the machinery, upon which thought
& motion depend? I proclaim to you
said the Genius raising his voice from
its low & sweet tone to one of ineffable
majesty, neither of these opinions is
true, listen whilst I reveal to you
the mysteries of [deletion]the[/deletion] spiritual natures,
but I almost fear that with [insertion]the[/insertion] mortal
veil of your senses surrounding you
these mysteries can never be made
perfectly intelligible to your mind.
Spiritual natures are eternal and
indivisible but their modes of being
are as infinitely varied as the forms of
matter; they have no relations to space
and in their transitions no dependen[deletion]ts[/deletion] [insertion]ce[/insertion]
upon time, so that they can pass

[page]132||dnp14h130pp|92023308[/page]
of [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] migration to any extent of any
race but [insertion]the[/insertion] Caucasian & they have usually
passed from the North to the South,
The negro race has always been driven
before these conquerors of the world
and the red men the aborigines of Ame
=rica are constantly diminishing in num
-ber and it seems probable that in a few
centuries more their pure blood will
be entirely extinct. In the population
of the world the great object therefore
is evidently to produce organised frames
most capable of the happy & intellectual
enjoyment of life to raise man above
the mere animal state to perpetuate
the advantages of civilisation. The
races most capable of these advantages
are preserved [deletion]perpetuated[/deletion] & extended
& no considerable improvements made
by an individual is ever lost to society,
You see living forms perpetuated in the
series of ages and apparently the quan-
=tity of life increased. In comparing the
population of the globe as it now is with
what it was ten centuries ago you
would find it considerably [deletion]increased[/deletion] [insertion]greater[/insertion]

-tion in any series of operations it seems
essential to strengthen the powers by
the forces ac[deletion]c[/deletion]quired from this principle
of hereditary descent: it will at first
perhaps strike your mind that the
mixing or blending of races is in direct
opposition to this principle of perfection
but here, I must require you to pause
& to consider the nature of the qualities
belonging to the human being; Excess of
a particular power which in itself is a
perfection becomes a defect: the organs
of tou[deletion]t[/deletion]ch may be so refined as to shew
a diseased sensibility, the ear may
become so exquisitely sensitive as to be
more susceptible to the uneasiness produ-
-ced by discords than to the pleasure de-
-pende[insertion]a[/insertion]nt on harmony; in the [deletion]li[/deletion] nations
that have been long civilized the defects
are generally those dependant on excess
of sensibility, defects which are cured
in the next generation by the strength
& power belonging to a ruder tribe.
In looking back upon the vision of
ancient history you will find that
there has never been an instance

[page]134||dnp14h132pp|92023310[/page]
& exalted or perpetuated. The history of par.
-ticular races of men affords distinct proofs
of this, The [deletion]cocasion[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]Circassian[/deletion][/insertion] [insertion]caucasian[/insertion] stock has always
preserved its superiority whilst the negro
or flatnosed race has always been marked
by want of intellectual power & capacity
for the arts of life; this last race in
fact has never been cultivated & hundred
generations successively improved would be
required to bring it to the state in which
the Caucasian race was the time of
the foundation of the greek republics
the principle of the improvement of the
character of races by the transmission of
hereditary qualities has not escaped the
observation of the legislations of the ancient
people by the divine law of Moses the
Israelites were enjoined to preserve the purity
of their blood & there was no higher crime
than that of forming alliances with the
idolatrous nations surrounding them: The
Bramins of Indostan have established
upon the same principle the law of casts
by which certain professions are made
hereditary; In this warm climate where
labour is so oppressive; to secure perfec-

[page]135||dnp14h133pp|92023311[/page]
133
a strong race to improve a weak one,
& giving energy to a debilitated popu-
-lation & [insertion]And[/insertion] the deserts that he makes
will become in another (in his passage)
age cultivated fields and the solitude
he produces will be [deletion]filled with[/deletion] [insertion]succeeded by[/insertion] a powerful
& healthy population -
[Horizontal rule]
The results of these events in the moral
& political world may be compared to those
produced in the vegetable kingdom by
the storms & heavy gales so usual at
the vernal equinox the time of the for=
=mation of the seed; the pollen or farina
of one flower is thrown upon the pistil
of another, & the crossing of varieties of
plants so essential to the perfection
of the vegetable kingdom produced.
In man moral causes and physical ones
modify each other. The transmision of
hereditary qualities to offspring is distinct
in the animal world & in the case of
disposition to disease it is sufficiently
obvious in the human being but it is
likewise a general principle & powers
or habits acquired by cultivation are
transmitted to the next generation

[page]136||dnp14h134pp|92023312[/page]
principles of an unerring intelligence
You saw in the decline of the Roman Empire
a people enfeebled by luxury, worn out
by excess, overrun by rude warriors, you
saw the giants of the North & East mixing
with the pygmies of the South & West,
an empire was destroyed, but the seeds
of moral & physical improvement in the
[deletion]pop[/deletion] race were sown; The new population
resulting from the alliances of the men
of the north with the women of the South
was more vigorous, more full of physical
power & more capable of intellectual
exertion than their apparently illsuited pro-
=genitors & the moral effects or final causes
of the migration of races, the plans of
conquests & ambition which have led to
revolutions & changes of kingdoms have [insertion]designed by man for such different objects[/insertion]
[deletion]been owing &[/deletion] [insertion]been the same & in their ultimate result[/insertion] [deletion]had the same object[/deletion] that of
improving by mixture the different families
of men. An Alaric or an Attila who
marches with legions of Barbarians
 for some gross [deletion]purposes[/deletion] [insertion]view[/insertion] of plunder or
ambition is an instrument of divine
power to effect a purpose which he is
wholly unconscious of; he is carrying

[page]137||dnp14h135pp|92023313[/page]
135
and the potatoe, perhaps the greatest bene-
-fit that the Old has derived from the New
-world is spreading over Europe; and will
continue to nourish an extensive population
even when the name of the race by whom
it was first cultivated in South America
is forgotten. I will now call your attention
to some remarkable laws belonging to
the history of society & from the consideration
of which you will be able gradually
to develope the higher & more exalted
principles of being. There appears nothing
more accidental than the sex of an infant
yet take any great city or any province
& you will find that the relations of
males & females are unalterable; again
[insertion]a[/insertion] part of the pure air of the atmosphere is
continually consumed in combustion and
respiration, living vegetables emit this
principle during their growth; nothing
appears more accidental than the
proportion of vegetable to animal life
on the surface of the earth, yet they
are perfectly equivalent, & the balance
of the sexes like the constitution of
the atmosphere depends upon the

[page]138||dnp14h136pp|92023314[/page]
either despised or neglected; & great indeed
must have been the pure & abstracted pleasure
resulting from [insertion]the exertion of[/insertion] intellectual superiority &
the discovery of truth & the bestowing
blessings & benefits upon society which
induced men to sacrifice all their com
=mon enjoyments & all their privileges
as citizens [insertion]to these exertions[/insertion] [deletion]to exerting those powers;[/deletion]
Anaxagoras Socrates [insertion]Archimedes[/insertion] Roger Bacon [deletion]in[/deletion]
[insertion]Gallileo Gallalei in[/insertion] their death or their imprisonment offer
instances of this kind & nothing can be
more striking than what appears to have
been the ingratitude of men towards their
greatest benefactors, but hereafter when
you understand more of the scheme of
the universe you will see the cause &
the effect of this & you will find the
whole system governed by the principles of
immutable justice. I have said that
in the progress of society all great and
real improvements are perpetuated, the
same corn which [deletion]five[/deletion] [insertion]four[/insertion] thousand years
ago, [insertion]was raised[/insertion] from an improved grass by an in-
=ventor worshiped for 2000 years in
the ancient world under the name of Ceres
still forms the principle food of mankind

proved people into the deserts of North
America & the Wilds of Canada.
In the common history of the world, as
compiled by authors in general, almost
all the great changes of nations are con-
-founded with changes in their dynasties
and events are usually referred either
to sovereigns, chiefs, heroes, or their armies,
which do in fact [deletion]depend upon[/deletion] [insertion]originate from[/insertion] entirely
different causes either of [insertion]an[/insertion] intellectual or of
a moral nature; governments depend far
more than is generally supposed upon
the opinion of the people & the spirit of
the age & nation. It sometimes hap-
-pens that a gigantic mind [deletion]arises[/deletion]
possesses supreme power & rises superior
to the age in which he is born, such
was Alfred in England & Peter in
Russia, but such instances are very
rare & in general it is neither amongst
sovereigns nor the higher classes of society
that the great improvers or benefactors
of mankind are to be found: the
works of the most illustrious names
were little valued in the time when
they were produced & their authors

[page]140||dnp14h138pp|92023316[/page]
and you will see new instruments created
by human ingenuity possessing the same
powers as the electrical organs of living
animals; to whatever part of the vision
of modern times you cast your eyes you
will find marks of superiority & of improve
=ment & I wish to impress upon you the
conviction that the results of intellectual
labour or of scientific genius are perma-
=nent & incapable of being lost; Monarchs
change their plans, governments their
objects, a fleet or an army effect their
purpose & then pass away, but a piece
of steel touched by the magnet preserves
its character [insertion]for ever[/insertion] & secures to man the dominion
of the trackless ocean. A new period of
society may send armies from the shores
of The Baltic to those of the Euxine
the Empire of the followers of Mahomet
may be broken in pieces by a northern
people & the dominion of the Britons
in Asia may share the fate of that
of Tamerlane or Zengiskhan, but the
steamboat which ascends the [deletion]Thames[/deletion] [insertion]Delaware[/insertion]
or the [deletion]Rhine[/deletion] [insertion]St Laurence[/insertion] will continue to be used
& will carry the civilization of an im-

by the resources of Chemistry, a power which
in the ancient world could not have been
imagined has been generated & applied to
almost all the machinery of active life,
the steam engine performs not only the
labour of horses but of man; by combinations
which appear almost possest of intelligence
waggons are moved by it, constructions
made, vessels caused to move in opposition
to wind & tide, & a power placed in
human hands which seems almost un-
limited; to these novel & still extending
improvements may be added others which
tho' of a secondary kind yet materially
affect the comforts of life; the collecting
from fossil materials the elements of
combustion and applying them so as to
illuminate by a single op[deletion]p[/deletion]eration houses
streets & even cities; if you look to the
results of the chemical arts you will
find new substances of the most ex-
=traordinary nature applied to [deletion]the[/deletion]
various novel purposes of life, you
will find a few experiments in electricity
leading to the marvelous results of
disarming the thunder cloud of its terrors,

telligible by a few superior men become
permanent , & the property of an enlightning
world; |_ Amongst the men who belong to this
early period there are two that I must [deletion]point[/deletion]
[deletion]out to you,[/deletion] [insertion]request you to notice[/insertion] who are contemporaries, one an
Englishman who pointed out the paths to the
discovery of [insertion]scientific[/insertion] truth & the other, a Tuscan, who
afforded the happiest experimental illustra
=tions of the speculative views of his brother
in science, you will see academies formed a
century later in Italy, France & Britain
in which the sciences are enla[insertion]r[/insertion]ged by newly
varied experiments & the true system of
the universe developed by an illustrious
Englishman, taught & illustrated, the
practical results of the progress of Physics
& Chemistry & Mechanics are of the
most marvellous kind, & to make them
all distinct would require a comparison
of Ancient & Modern times; Ships that
were moved by human labour in the ancient
[deletion]world[/deletion] [insertion]times[/insertion] are transported by the winds,
& a piece of steel tou[deletion]t[/deletion]ched by the magnet
points to the mariner his unerring course
from the Old to the New World & by
the exertions of one man of Genius aided

[page]143||dnp14h141pp|92023319[/page]
141
like those of gunpowder & the press illustrate
the times to which they belong & form
brilliant epochs in the history of the world.
If you look [insertion]back[/insertion] into the schools of regenerated Italy
you will see in them the works of the Greek
masters of Philosophy & if you attend to the
science taught in them you will find it
vague, obscure & full of erroneous notions
you will find in this early period of improve
-ment branches of Philosophy even applied
to purposes of delusion, the most sublime
of the departments of human knowledge
astronomy abused by [deletion]pretenders[/deletion] [insertion]imposters[/insertion] who
from the aspect of the planetary world
pretended to preedict the fortunes &
destinies of individuals, you will
see in the laboratories, alchemists
searching for universal medicine an
elixir of life, & for the philosopher's
stone or a method of converting all
metals into gold, but unexpected
[deletion]truths[/deletion] & useful discoveries [insertion]you will find even in this age arise[/insertion] aris[deletion]ing[/deletion]
amidst the clouds of error [deletion]& found[/deletion]
& [deletion]amidst[/deletion] the smoke of the furnace;
[deletion]&[/deletion] delusion & error vanish & pass away
& truths seized upon & made in-

[page]144||dnp14h142pp|92023320[/page]
become the principle elements of success; Civilized
man [insertion]is rendered[/insertion] [deletion]becomes[/deletion] in consequence infinitely superior
to [insertion]the[/insertion] savage & gunpowder gives permanence to
his triumph & secures the cultivated nations
from ever being again [insertion]overrun[/insertion] [deletion]molested[/insertion] by the inroads
of millions of Barbarians. There is so much
of identity of feature in the Character of the
two or three centuries that are just passed
that I wish you only to take a very transient
view of the political military events belong-
-ing to them: you will find attempts made by
the chiefs of certain great nations to acquire
[deletion]power[/deletion] [insertion]predominance[/insertion] & empire; you will see those attempts
after being partially successful resisted by
other nations & the balance of power appa-
rentaly for a moment broken again restored,
Amongst the rival nations that may be con-
-sidered as forming the republic of modern
Europe you will see one preeminent for
her maritime strength & Colonial & commercial
enterprize & she you will find retains her
superiority only because she is favourable to
the liberty of mankind, but you must not
suffer the vision of modern Europe to pass
from your eyes without viewing some other
results of the efforts of men of genius, which

Arms as contrasted with those of the ancient
world," I looked & saw that in the place of
the rolls of Papyrus, Libraries were now filled
with books. "Behold, the Genius said, the
printing press; by the invention of Faust
the productions of Genius are as it were
made imperishable, capable of indefinite
multiplication, & rendered an [deletion]imperishable[/deletion]
[deletion]&[/deletion] inalienable heritage of the human mind
by this Art apparently so humble the pro-
gress of society is secured & man is spared
the humiliation of witnessing again
scenes like those which followed the des
-truction of the Roman Empire. Now
look to the warriors of modern times, you
see the spear, the javelin, the shield &
the cuirass of steel are changed for the
musket flight artillery; that german
[person_666]monk[/person_666] who discovered gunpowder did
not meanly affect the destinies of man
-kind, wars are become less bloody by becoming
less personal, mere brutal strength is
rendered of comparatively little avail,
all the resources of civilization are re-
-quired to maintain & move a large army.
Wealth ingenuity & perseverance [deletion]are[/deletion]

[page]146||dnp14h144pp|92023322[/page]
arise in another state of society." I opened
my eyes again & saw Italy recovering from
her desolation, towns arising with govern-
-ments almost upon the model of ancient Athens
& Rome & these different small states
rivals in Arts & Arms. I saw the remains
of Libraries which had been preserved in
monasteries & churches by a holy influence
which even the Goth & the Vandal res-
-pected again opened to the people. I
saw Rome itself rising from her ashes
the fragments of statues found amidst
the ruins of her palaces & imperial villas
becoming the models of the regeneration of
Art; I saw magnificent temples raised
in Rome again become the metropolis of
[deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a new Ie[/insertion] Christian world, & ornamented with
the most brilliant masterpieces of the Arts
of Design; I saw an Etruscan city as it
were contending with Rome for preeminence
in the productions of genius, & the spirit
awakened in Italy spreading its influence
from the South to the North: "Now the
Genius said, society has taken its mo-
-dern & permanent aspect, consider
a moment its relations to Letters and to

idle & luxurious population, those farms
which [deletion]were[/deletion] [insertion]had been[/insertion] cultivated by heroes, who left
the plough to take the command of armies
were now in the hands of slaves & the militia
of free men were replaced by bands of
mercenaries, who sold the empire to the
highest bidder; I saw immense masses of
[deletion]men[/deletion] [insertion]warriors[/insertion] collecting in the north & east car-
-rying with them no other proofs of cul-
-tivation but their horses & steel arms;
I saw these savages every where attacking
this mighty empire plundering cities,
destroying the monuments of Art and
lit[deletion]t[/deletion]erature & like wild beasts tearing
into pieces & destroying the Roman power.
Ruin, devastation & darkness were before
me & I closed my eyes to avoid the
melancholy scene. "See, said the Genius
the [deletion]melancholy[/deletion] [insertion]lamentable[/insertion] termination of a power
believed by its founders to be invincible,
& intended to be eternal, yet you will
find, tho' the glory & greatness be-
-longing to its military genius have
passed away, yet those belonging to
the Arts & Institutions by which it
adorned & dignified life will again

[page]148||dnp14h146pp|92023324[/page]
the arena below animals of the most extraordinary
kind & which have rarely been seen living in
modern Europe; the [deletion]Camel leopard[/deletion] [insertion]Giraffe[/insertion] the [deletion]Dda[/deletion]
[insertion]zebra, the Rhinoceros[/insertion] & the Ostrich from the deserts of Africa
beyond the Niger. the Hippopotamus from
the upper Nile. & the royal tiger [insertion]& the Gnu[/insertion] from
the banks of the Ganges. Looking over
Rome; which in its majesty of palaces &
temples & in its colossal aqueducts bring -
ing water even from the [insertion]snows of the[/insertion] distant Appenines;
seemed [deletion]almost[/deletion] [insertion]more like[/insertion] the creation of a supernatural
power than the work of human hands;
looking over Rome to the distant landscape
I saw the whole face as it were at the ancient
world, adorned with miniature images of
this splendid [insertion]metropolis[/insertion] [deletion]city[/deletion] ; Where the Roman con-
quered [insertion]there[/insertion] he colonized where he carried his
arms these he fixed likewise his household
gods & from the deserts of Arabia to the
mountains of Caledonia there uppeared but one
people, having the same Arts, Language, and
Letters, all [deletion]having the same[/deletion] [insertion]of[/insertion] grecian origin. -
I looked again & saw an entire change in the
brilliant aspect of this roman world; the
people of conquerous & heroes was no longer
visible; the cities were filled with an

[page]149||dnp14h147pp|92023325[/page]
147
tremendous instrument of power, [insertion]in the hands of the warriors[/insertion] I saw applied
by the genius of the artist to strike forms, even
more perfect than those of life, out of the rude
marble, & I saw the walls of the palaces and
temples covered with pictures in which histo-
=rical events were pourtrayed with the truth
of nature & the poetry of mind; The voice
now awakened my attention by saying "You
have now before you the vision of that state
of society which is an object of admiration
to the youth of modern times & the recollections
of which & the precepts founded on these
recollections constitute an important part
of your education. Your maxims of war
& policy, your taste in letters & the arts
are derived from models left by that people
or by their immediate imitators whom
you shall now see". I opened my eyes
& recognised the very spot in which I was
[deletion]standing[/deletion] [insertion]sitting[/insertion] when the vision had commenced,
I was [deletion]standing[/deletion] on the top of an arcade;
under a silken canopy, looking down
upon the tens of thousands of people who
were crowded round the seats at the Colliseum
ornamented with all the spoils that the
wealth of a world can give. I saw in

[page]150||dnp14h148pp|92023326[/page]
see human life more implete with power and
with activity," Again another scene broke upon
my vision. I saw the bronze instruments [deletion]thrown[/deletion]
which had belonged to the former state of society
thrown away, malleable iron converted into hard
steel, this steel applied to a thousand purposes
of civilized life. I saw bands of men, who
made use of it for [deletion]the purposes of[/deletion] defensive
armour & for offensive weapons; I saw these
ironclad men in small numbers subduing
thousands of savages & establishing amongst
them their arts & institutions; I saw a few
men on the eastern shores of Europe resisting
with the same materials the united forces of
Asia, I saw a chosen band die in defence
of their co[insertion]u[/insertion]ntry, destroyed by an army a
thousand times as numerous, & I saw this
same army in its turn caused to dissappear
& destroyed or driven from the shores of
Europe by the brethren of that band of mar-
-tyred patriots: I saw [deletion]the[/deletion] bodies of these
men traversing the sea, founding colonies
building cities, & wherever they establised
themselves carrying with them their peculiar
arts: [insertion]Towns, & temples arose containing[/insertion] schools [deletion]arose[/deletion], libraries filled with the
rolls of the papyrus: the same steel, such a

[page]151||dnp14h149pp|92023327[/page]
149
to crowds around them and others who [insertion]are[/insertion] apparently
amuzing listening groups by a kind of song or
of recitative; these are the earliest bards &
orators, but all their signs of thought are oral
for written language does not yet exist.
The next scene which appeared was one of
varied business & imagery, I saw a man who
[deletion]carried[/deletion] [insertion]bore in his hands[/insertion] the same instrument as our modern
smiths presenting a vase which appeared to be
made of iron amidst the acclamations of an
assembled multitude eng[insertion]a[/insertion]ged in triumphal
processions before the altar dignified by the
name of Apollo [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]at[/insertion] Delphi. & I saw in the
same place men who carried rolls of papyrus
in their hands & wrote upon them with reeds
containing ink made from the smoke of wood
mixed with a solution of glue. See, the
genius said, an immense change produced in
the condition of society by the two arts, of
which you see here the origin, the one that
of rendering iron malleable [insertion]which is[/insertion] owing to a
single individual an obscure greek, the other
that of making thought permanent in written
characters, an art which has gradually arisen
from the hieroglyphicks which you may
observe, on yonder pyramids; you will now

[page]152||dnp14h150pp|92023328[/page]
eyes. I shall describe this scene & the others
in the succession in which they appeared before
me & the observations by which they were
accompanied in the voice of the wonderful
being who appeared as [deletion]b[/deletion]my [deletion]genius or[/deletion] in-
=tellectual guide. In the scene which followed
that of the agricultural or pastoral people
I saw [insertion]a[/insertion] great extent of cultivated plains, large
cities on the sea shore, domes, forums &
temples ornamenting them; Men associated
in groups, mounted on horses & performing
military exercises, gallies moved by oars on
the ocean, roads intersecting the country
covered with travellers & containing carriages
moved by oxen or horses. The genius now
said "You see the early [deletion]e[/deletion]state [insertion]state[/insertion] of civilization
of man, the cottages of the last race that
you beheld, have become improved into stately
dwellings, palaces & temples in which use is
combined with ornament, the few men to whom
as I said before the foundations of these
improvements [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]were[/insertion] owing have had divine
honours payed to their memory: but look
at the instruments belonging to this generation
[deletion]of men[/deletion] & you will find that they are only
of brass, you see men who are talking

You shall be shewn
other visions of the passages
of [deletion]the[/deletion] time [deletion]that is past[/deletion]
but as you are carried
along the stream that flows
from the period of creation
to the present moment
I shall only arrest your transit
[deletion]passage[/deletion] to make you
observe some circumstances
which will demonstrate
the truths I wish you to know
and which will
explain to you
the little it is permitted
me to understand of the
scheme of the universe.
I again found myself in darkness & in
motion & I was again arrested by a
the opening of a new scene upon my

[page]154||dnp14h152pp|92023330[/page]
These groups of men who are
escaped from the state of infancy
they owe their improvement
to a few superior minds still
amongst them: That aged man
that you see with a crowd
around him taught them
to build cottages. From that other
they learnt to domesticate cattle.
From others to collect & sow
corn and seeds of fruit, & these
arts will never be lost, another
generation will see them more
perfect. The houses in a
century more will be
larger & more convenient
The flocks of cattle more numerous
the corn fields more extensive,
the morasses will be drained,
the fruit trees increased -

"See the birth of time! look at man in
his newly created state full of youth &
vigour, [deletion]dost thou[/deletion] [insertion]Did you[/insertion] see aught in this state to
admire or to envy." As the last words fell on
my ear I was again as before rapidly put
in motion & I seemed again resistless to be
hurried upon a stream of air & again in
perfect darkness: In a moment [deletion]as before[/deletion] an
indistinct light again appeared before any
eyes & a country opened upon my view,
which appeared partly wild & partly culti=
=vated: there were fewer woods & morasses
than in the scene I had just before seen.
I saw men who were covered with the skins
of animals & who were driving [deletion]animals[/deletion] [insertion]cattle[/insertion] to
enclosed pastures, I saw others who were
reaping & collecting corn, others who were
making it into bread: I saw cottages
furnished with many of the conveniences of
life & a people in that state of pastoral
& agricultural improvement which had
been imaged by the poet as belonging to
the golden age: The same voice,
which I shall call that of
the Genius said: Look at

[page]156||dnp14h154pp|92023332[/page]
forests & marshes I saw wild animals [deletion]feeding[/deletion] [insertion]grazing[/insertion]
in large savannahs & carnivorous beasts such as
lions & tygers occasionlaly disturbing & destroying
them. I saw naked savages feeding upon wild
fruits or destroying shellfish or fighting with
clubs for the remains of a whale which had
been thrown upon the shore: I observed that
they had no habitations, that they concealed
themselves from the sun under the shelter
of [deletion]a[/deletion] palm trees & that the only delicious
food which nature seemed to have given to
them was the date & the cocoa nut but
these were in very small quantities. [insertion]& the object of contention[/insertion]
[insertion]& of bloody quarrels[/insertion] I saw that some few of those wretched human
beings that inhabited the wide waste before
my eyes had weapons pointed with flint or
fishbone which they made use of for
destroying birds, quadrupeds, or fishes,
that they fed upon raw, but their greatest de-
=licacy appeared to be a maggot or worm
which they sought for with great perseverance
in the buds of the palm. When I had cast my
eyes of the varied features of this melancholy
scene which was now lighted by a rising sun
I heard again the same voice which had
astonished me in the Colisseum [insertion]los[/insertion]. & which said

[page]157||dnp14h155pp|92023333[/page]
155
sublime poetical composition -"[deletion]Th[/deletion] [insertion]Y[/insertion] ou like
all [deletion]thy[/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] brethren [insertion]said the voice[/insertion] ar[deletion]t[/deletion] [insertion]e[/insertion] entirely ignorant of
every thing belonging to yourselves the
world you inhabit your future destinies
& the scheme of the universe & yet you have
the folly to believe that [deletion]ye know everything[/deletion] [insertion]you are acquainted[/insertion]
[insertion] with the past, the present & the future.[/insertion] I am an intelligence somewhat superior
to you tho there are millions of beings as
much [deletion]superior as[/deletion] [insertion]above[/insertion] me in power & intellect
as man is [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]above[/insertion] the meanest & weakest reptile
that crawls beneath his feet; yet something
I can teach [deletion]thee[/deletion] [insertion]you[/insertion]: yield [deletion]thy[/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] mind wholly
to the influence which I shall exert upon
it & [deletion]thou[/deletion] [insertion]you[/insertion] shall be undecieved in [deletion]thy[/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] views of the
history of the world & of the system you inhabit.
|_ At this moment the bright light dissappeared [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion]
sweet & harmonious voice which [deletion]seemed[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] the only
proof of [insertion]the presence of[/insertion] a superior intelligence ceased. I [deletion]seemed[/deletion]
[insertion]was[/insertion] in utter darkness & silence & seemed to myself
to be carried rapidly upon a stream of air
without any other sensation than that of
moving quickly thro' space. Whilst I was still
in motion, a dim & hazy light which seemed
like that of twilight in a rainy morning
broke upon my sight & gradually a country
displayed itself to my view covered with

[page]158||dnp14h156pp|92023334[/page]
seems always degrading; she is represented by the poets
as eternal in her youth but amongst these ruins
she appears to me eternal in her age & here no
traces of [deletion]youth or[/deletion] renovation appear in the
ancient of days". I had scarcely concluded this
ideal sentence when any reverie became
deeper. The ruins surrounding me appeared to
vanish from my sight, the light of the moon
became more intense & the orb itself seemed
to expand in a flood of splendour. At the same [insertion]time[/insertion]
that my visual organs appeared so singularly
affected, the most melodious sounds filled
my ears, - softer yet at the same time deeper
& fuller than I had ever heard in the most
harmonious & perfect concert, it appeared to me
as if I had entered a new state of existence
and I was so perfectly lost in the new kind of
sensation [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]which[/insertion] I experienced that I had no
recollections & no perception of identity.
On a sudden the music ceased but the brilliant
light still continued to surround me, & I heard
a low but extremely distinct & sweet
voice which appeared to issue from the
centre of it; the sounds were at first musical
like those of a harp but they soon became ar-
-ticulate, & as if a prelude to some piece of

[page]159||dnp14h157pp|92023335[/page]

to them a wildness, & a kind of indefinite
character, such as I suppose belongs to the
[deletion]true[/deletion] poetical [insertion]temperament[/insertion] [deletion]character[/deletion]:" it must be so. I thought
to myself, no new world will rise out of the
ruins of this, - no new empire will be founded
upon these colossal remains of the old Romans.
The world like the individual flourishes in
youth, rises to strength in manhood, falls into
decay in age: and the ruins of an empire
are like the decayed frame of an individual,
except that they have some tints of beauty
which nature bestows upon them: the sun
of civilization arose in the East and advanced
toward the West, it [insertion]is[/insertion] now [deletion]probably[/deletion] at [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] meridian
in a few centuries more it will probably be
seen sinking below the horizon even in the
New World & there will be left darkness only
where there was a bright light [deletion]&[/deletion] deserts of
sand where there were populous cities
& stagnant morasses where the green meadow
or the bright cornfield once appeared. -
I called up images of this kind in my ima-
-gination. Time, I said to myself, which
purifies and as it were sanctifies the mind
destroys & brings into utter decay the
body & even in nature its influence

[page]160||dnp14h158pp|92023336[/page]
church-yard may [insertion]be[/insertion] compared with those of an empire
& the remains of the metropolis of the world.
Ambrosio to whom this conversation seemed
[deletion]tiresome[/deletion] [insertion]disagreeable[/insertion] put us in mind of an engagement
which we had made to spend the evening at the
Conversazione of a celebrated Lady & proposed
to call the carriage. The reflexions which
the conversation & the scene had left in my
mind little disposed me for general society.
I requested them to keep their engagement &
said I was resolved to spend an hour amidst the
solitude of the ruins & I [deletion]requested[/deletion] [insertion]desired[/insertion] them to send
back the carriage for me. They left me expressing
a [deletion]wish[/deletion] [insertion]hope[/insertion] that my poetical or melancholy fancy
might not be the occasion of a cold & wished
me the company of some of the spectres of the ancient
Romans. - When I was left alone I seated my
-self in the moonshine on one of the steps leading
to the seats supposed to have been occupied by
the patricians in the Colisseum at the time of
the public games. The train of ideas in which
I had indulged before my friends left me con-
-tinued to flow with a vividness & force increased
by the stillness & solitude of the scene, and
the full moon has always a peculiar effect on
these moods of feeling in my mind giving

sparkling amidst the gloom & darkness of the
ruins, but which were no longer visible when
they rose above the horizon; their feeble light
being lost & utterly obscured in the brightness
of the moonbeams in the heavens" -
Onuphrio said. "I am not sorry that you
have changed the conversation: you have
given us the history of a most interesting
recollection & well expressed a solemn tho'
humiliating feeling. In such moments & amongst
such scenes it is impossible not to be struck
with the nothingness of human glory & the
transiency of human works. This, one of the
greatest monuments on the face of the
earth was raised by a people then its
masters only 18 centuries ago in a few ages
more it will be but as dust & of all the
testimonals of the vanity or power of man
whether raised to immortalize his name
or to contain his decaying bones without
[deletion]an end[/deletion] [insertion]a name[/insertion], no one is known to have a duration
beyond what might be measured by the
existence of an hundred generations, &
it is only to multiply centuple for instance
the period of time, & the memorials of a
village & the monuments of a country

-vanced spring softened the grey & yellow tints of the
decaying stones & as the lights gradually became
fainter the masses appeared grander & more gigan
-tic & when the twilight had entirely dissappeared
the contrast of light & shade in the beams of the
full moon & beneath a sky of the brightest
saffire [insertion]sapphire[/insertion] but so highly illuminated that only
Jupiter & a few stars of the first magnitude were
visible gave a solemnity & a magnificence
to the scene which awakened the highest
degree of that emotion which is so properly
termed the sublime; the beauty & the perma
-nency of the heavens & the principle of con[deletion]s[/deletion] [insertion]serv[/insertion] o-
-l[deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion]tion [insertion]conservation[/insertion] belonging to the system of the Universe,
the work of the eternal & divine architect,

works of man in his most active & power
 -ful state & [insertion]And[/insertion] at this moment so humble appear
=ed to me the condition of the most exalted
beings belonging to the earth so feeble
their combinations so minute the point
in space & so limited the period in time
in which they act that I could hardly avoid
comparing the generations of man & the
effects of his genius & power to the swarms
of Lucioli or fire flies which were dancing
around me; and that appeared flitting &

You must not be angry with me that I do not
allow infallibity to your church, having been myself
brought up by protestant parents who were rigidly
attached to the doctrines of Calvin.
I saw Ambrosios countenance kindle at O's. [deletion]con-[/deletion]
[deletion]=versation[/deletion] [insertion]explanation of his opinions[/insertion] & he appeared to be meditating an
angry reply. I endeavoured to change the con-
=versation to the state of the Colisseum with
which it had began. "These ruins, I said, as
you have both observed are highly impressive
yet when I saw them six years ago they
had a still stronger effect on my imagination
whether it was the charm of novelty or that my
mind was fresher [insertion]fresher[/insertion], or that the circumstances under
which I saw them were peculiar I know not
but probably all these causes o[deletion]p[/deletion]perated
in affecting [deletion]my mind[/deletion] [insertion]me[/insertion]; it was a still & beauti-
-ful evening [deletion]at[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] the end of May the last
sunbeams were dying away in the western sky
& the first moonbeams shining in the eastern,
The bright orange tints of the evening
lighted up the ruins, & as it were kindled
the snows that still remained on the distant
Appenines which were visible from the
highest accessible part of the Amphitheatre
In this glow of colouring the green of ad-

in the history of the early world you would have found
found the Christian dispensation naturally arising out
of the Jewish & the doctrines & creeds of the pagan
nations all preparatory to the triumph & final
establishment of a creed fitted for the most enlight-
- ened state of the human mind & equally adapted [insertion]adapted[/insertion]
to every climate & every people.
To this animated apeal of Ambrosio Onuphrio
replied in the most tranquil manner & with
the air of an unmoved philosopher - "You
mistake me Ambrosio if you consider me as
hostile to Christianity: I am not of the school
of the french Encylopedists or of the english infidels
I consider religion as esential to man & belonging
to the human mind in the same manner as
instincts belong to the brute creation, a light
if you please of revelation to guide him thro' the
darkness of this life & to keep alive his nudging
hope of immortality, but pardon me if I
consider this instinct as equally useful
in all its different forms & still as a divine
light thro whatever medium or cloud of human
passion or prejudice it passes. I reverence it in
the follower of Bramah in the disciple of
Mahomet & I wonder at it in all the variety
of forms it adopts in the christian world.

163
[deletion]or the[/deletion] course of ages, is comparatively an insig
-nificant cause and that similar results occur
whether the faith be that of Hermes, of Jupiter
of Jehovah or of Jesus. -
To this Ambrosio replied, his countenance & the
tones of his voice expressing some emotion. "I do
not think, [deletion]he said,[/deletion] Onuphrio that you consider
this subject with your usual sagacity or accuteness
indeed I never hear you [deletion]on the[/deletion] subject[insertion]s[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]connected with[/insertion] religious
[insertion]faith[/insertion] without pain & without a feeling of regret that
you have not applied your powerful understan-
-ding to a more minute & correct examination
of the evidences of revealed religion; You would then
I think have seen in the origin, progress, eleva-
-tion, decline & fall of the empires of antiquity
proofs that they were intended for a definite
end in the scheme of human redemption,
you would have found p[deletion]h[/deletion]rophecies which
have been amply verified & the foundation
or the ruin of a kingdom which appears
in civil history so great an event, in the history
of man in his religious institutions is com-
-paratively of small moment; you would have
found the establishment of the worship of one
god amongst a despised & contemptible
people as the most important circumstance

[page]166||dnp14h164pp|92023342[/page]
the Cae[deletion]s[/deletion]sars. Such I am sorry to say is the
general history of all the works & institutions
belonging to humanity: they rise, flourish & then
decay & fall: & the period of their decline is generally
proportional to that of their elevation. In ancient
Thebes or Memphis the peculiar genius of the
people have left us monuments from which we
can judge of their arts tho' we cannot understand
the nature of their superstitions. Of Babylon
& of [place_1214]Troy[/place_1214] the remains are almost extinct &
what we know of these famous cities is almost
entirely derived from literary records. Ancient
Greece & Rome we view in the few miserable
remains of their monuments: & the time will
arrive when modern Rome will be what
ancient Rome now is & ancient Rome or
Athens will be what Tyre or [deletion]Niniveh[/deletion] now [insertion]Carthage[/insertion]
are, known only by coloured dust in the desert
or coloured sand, containing the fragments of [deletion]bri[insertion]c[/insertion]ks[/deletion]
[insertion]bricks[/insertion] or glass, washed up by the wave of a stormy
sea: I could [insertion]can[/insertion] pursue these thoughts still further
& show that the wood of the cross or the bronze
of the statue decay [deletion]almost[/deletion] as quickly as if
they had not been sanctified & I think I could
shew that their influence is owing to the ima
-gination which when time is considered or the

O. now resumed the discourse. He said. I
have not the same exalted views on the subject
which our friend A. has so eloquently expressed,
some little of the perfect state in which these
ruins exist may have been owing to the causes
which he has described, but these causes have
only lately began to operate & the mischief was
done before Christianity was established at Rome
Feeling differently on these subjects, I admire[deletion]d[/deletion] this
venerable ruin rather as a record of the destruction
of a power of the greatest people that ever existed
tha[deletion]t[/deletion] [insertion]n[/insertion] as a proof of the triumph of Christianity,
& I am carried forward in melancholy antici-
-pation to the period when even the magnificent
dome of S[superscript]t[/superscript] Peters will be in a similar state
to that in which the Col[deletion]isseum[/deletion] [insertion]osceum[/insertion] now is & when
its relics [deletion]perhaps[/deletion] may be preserved by the
sanctifying influence of some new & now
unknown faith, when perhaps the statue of
Jupiter which nows recieves the kiss [deletion]as the[/deletion]
of the devotee as the visage of [person_982]S[superscript]t[/superscript] Peter[/person_982]
may [deletion]recieve[/deletion] [insertion]be applied to[/insertion] another holy use as the per
=sonification of a future saint or divinity,
& when the monuments of the papal mag-
=nificence shall be mixed with the same
dust as that which now covers the tombs of

[page]168||dnp14h166pp|92023344[/page]
say that the preservation of this pile by the sanc-
-tifying effects of a few crosses planted round it is
almost a miraculous event & [insertion]And[/insertion] what a contrast
the present application of this building connec-
-ted with holy feelings & ex[deletion]l[/deletion]alted hopes is to that
of the ancient one when it was used for exhibiting
to the Roman people the destruction of men
by wild beasts or of men more savage than
wild beasts by each other, to gratify a horrible
appetite for cruelty founded upon a still more
[deletion]horrible[/deletion] [insertion]detestable[/insertion] lust, that of universal domination, that
of making all mankind slaves to the imperial
people [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]And[/insertion] who would have supposed in the time
of [deletion]Titus[/deletion] [insertion]Nero[/insertion] that a faith despised in its insignificant
origin & persecuted from the supposed [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]obscurity[/insertion] of its
founder & it principles, should have [deletion]reared[/deletion] [insertion]raised[/insertion] a [deletion]temple[/deletion] [insertion]Dome[/insertion]
to [insertion]the memory of[/insertion] one of its humble teachers more glorious than
was ever framed for [person_795]Jupiter[/person_795] or Apollo in the ancient
world, & have preserved even the ruins of the temples
of the pagan deities, & have burst forth in
splendour & majesty consecrating truth even amidst
the shrines of error, employing the idols of the
Roman superstition for the most holy purposes,
& raising a bright and constant light amidst the
dark & starless night which followed the des-
-truction of the Roman empire.

appear in the distance: their gray & [deletion]falling[/deletion] [insertion]tottering[/insertion]
turrets & their moss-stained arches reposing as it
were upon the decaying vegetation & there is nothing
that marks the existence of life [insertion]or[/insertion] of a present
generation, except the few pious devotees who
wander from station to station in the Arena
below kneeling before the cross & demonstrating
the triumph of a religion which recieved in
this very spot in the early period of its existence
one of its most severe persecutions, & which never
-theless has preserved what remains of that building
where attempts were made to stifle it almost
at its birth, for without the influence of Christianity
even these majestic ruins would have been
dispersed or levelled to the dust. [insertion]Plundered & so no new for[/insertion]
Plundered of their lead & iron by the barbarians
goths & Vandals & robbed even of their stones by
roman princes, the Barberini, they owe what
remains of their relics to the sanctifying influence
of that faith which has preserved for the world
all that was worth preserving not merely arts
& literature, but that likewise which constitutes
the progressive nature of intellect & the institutions
which afford to it happiness in this world &
[deletion]afforded[/deletion] hopes of a bessed immortality in the
next & [insertion]And[/insertion] being of the faith of Rome I may

of execution! had we not historical documents
to inform us of the period when this structure was
raised & of the purposes for which it was designed,
it might be imagined the work of a race of giants,
a council chamber for those Titans fabled to have
warred against the Gods of the pagan mythology.
The size of the masses of travertin of which it is
composed is in harmony with the immense mag-
-nitude of the building. It is hardly to be wondered
at that a people which constructed such works
for their daily sports for their usual amusements
should have possessed strength, enduring energy
& perseverance sufficient to enable them to
conquer the world: their [insertion]They[/insertion] appear always to have
formed their plans & made their combinations
as if their power were beyond the reach of chance
independent of the influence of time & founded for
unlimited duration [insertion]-[/insertion] for eternity!
A. took up the discourse of O. & said. & "The aspect of
this wonderful heap of ruins is so picturesque
that it is impossible to regret its decay & at this
season of the year the colours of the vegetation
are in harmony with those of the falling
building & how perfectly the whole landscape
 is in Tone! The remains of the palace of
the Caesars & of the golden halls of Nero

[insertion]even of an[/insertion] oligarchy; The other friend whom I shall call
Onuphrio was a man of [insertion]a[/insertion] very different character
views & opinions; Belonging to the english aristocracy
he had some of the predudices [insertion]usually attached[/insertion] [deletion]belonging[/deletion] to birth &
rank, but his manners were [deletion]gentlemanly &[/deletion]
[insertion]gentle & his temper good & his disposition[/insertion] amiable. Having been partly educated at a northern
university in Britain he had adopted views
in religion which went even beyond toleration
& which might be regarded as entering the verge
of scepticism; For a patrician he was tolerably
liberal in his political views. His imagination
was poetical & discursive, his taste good & his
tact extremely fine, so exquisite indeed that i[deletion]s[/deletion] [insertion]t[/insertion] some=
times approached to morbid sensibility & disgusted
him with slight defects & made him keenly sen-
=sible of small perfections to which common minds
would have indifferent. |_ In the beginning of October
on a very fine afternoon. I drove with these
two friends to the Col[deletion]is[/deletion][insertion]o[/insertion]seum a monument
which for the hundreth time even I had viewed
with a new admiration; My friends partook of
my sentiments: - I s[insertion]h[/insertion]all give the conversation,

I passed the Autumn & the early Winter of the
years 1818 & 1819 at Rome. The society was as
is usual in that metropolis of the old christian
world numerous & diversified; In it there were found
many intellectual foreigners, & amongst them [deletion]many[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion]
distinguished Britons who had a higher object
in making this city their residence than mere idleness
or vague curiosity. Amongst these my countrymen
there were two gentlemen with whom I formed
a particular intimacy & who were my frequent
companions in the visits that I made to the monu-
-ments of the [deletion]ancient[/deletion] grandeur of the [insertion]old[/insertion] Romans &
to the masterpieces of ancient & of modern art.
One of them [deletion]is[/deletion] I shall call Ambrosio: he was a
man of highly cultivated taste great classical
erudition & minute historical knowledge. In
religion he was of the Roman catholic persuasion
but a catholic of the most liberal school
who [insertion]in another age[/insertion] might have been secretary to [underline]Ganganelli[/underline]:
His views upon the subject of Politicks & of
religion were liberal, but his leaning was
rather to Church government & to the power of
a single magistrate than to universalism
