            <note>From 1812 Davy used Faraday as his amanuensis and the following year secured his appointment as laboratory assistant at the Royal Institution. Despite a difficult relationship with Davy, Faraday later became the dominent figure at the Royal Institution and one of the leading scientific personalities of the middle third of the nineteenth century.

            <note>A pupil of Socrates, much of Plato's large corpus of surviving philosophical texts are written in the form of Socratic dialogues. He espoused a philosophical idealism including the primacy of mathematics and an anti-democratic political philosophy because of the execution of Socrates. Plato's writings have been, and are, so influential that all subsequent philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato.</note>
