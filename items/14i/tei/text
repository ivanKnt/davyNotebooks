The mists disperse and where a sullen cloud.<lb/>
Hung on the mountains verge the Sun bursts forth.<lb/>
In all its majesty of purple light,<lb/>
It is a winters evening and the year<lb/>
Is fast departing; yet the hues of heaven<lb/>
Are bright as in the summers warmest months,<lb/>
It is the season of the sleep of things<lb/>
But nature in her sleep is lovely still.<lb/>
The trees display no green, no forms of life,<lb/>
And yet a magic foliage cloaths them round,<lb/>
The purest crystals of pellucid ice<lb/>
All purple in the sun-set<lb/>
Amidst the wood<lb/>
Fantastically rise the towering cliffs,<lb/>
That in another season had been white;<lb/>
But now contrasted with the brilliant ice<lb/>
Shine in aerial tints of purest blue.<lb/>
The varied outline has a thousand charms;<lb/>
Here rises high a venerable wood<lb/>
Where oaks are seen with massy ice girt round<lb/>
And birches pendant with their glittering arms,<lb/>
And graceful beeches clinging to the soil:<lb/>
These massy forms exist of rocks alone.<lb/>
Rising as if the work of human art.<lb/>
The pride of some great paladin of other days<lb/>
In awful ruins<lb/>
Nearer I behold<lb/>
The palace of a race of mighty kings,<lb/>
But now another tenants. On those walls<lb/>
Where erst the silver lily spread her leaves.<lb/>
The graceful symbol of a brilliant court,<lb/>
The golden eagle shines, the bird of prey.<lb/>
Emblem of rapine and of lawless power.<lb/>
Such is the fitful change of human things:<lb/>
An empire rises like a cloud in heaven<lb/>
Red in the morning sun, spreading its tints<lb/>
Of golden hue along the feverish sky<lb/>
And filling the horizon. Soon its tints<lb/>
Are darkened, &amp; it brings the thunder storm,<lb/>
Lightening, and hail, and desolation comes;<lb/>
But in destroying it dissolves &amp; falls,<lb/>
Never to rise.<lb/>
Prophecy of the downfall<lb/>

And canopied with everlasting snow.<lb/>
That lovely river rolling at my feet<lb/>
Its bright green waves, &amp; winding midst the rocks<lb/>
Brown in their winters foliage, gain'd from thee <lb/>
Its flood of waters; and through a devious <add xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0">course</add> maze<lb/>
Though it has lav'd the fertile plains, &amp; wash'd<lb/>
The cities walls, and mingled with the streams<lb/>
Of lowland origin, yet still preserves<lb/>
Its native character of mountain strength,<lb/>
Its colour, and its motion. Such are those<lb/>
Amongst the generations of mankind,<lb/>
To whom the stream of thought descends from heaven<lb/>
With all the force of reason, and the power<lb/>
Of sacred genius. Through the world they pass<lb/>
Still uncorrupted; and on what they take<lb/>
From social life; bestow a character<lb/>
Of dignity: Greater they become,<lb/>
But never loose their native purity.<lb/>

I see the rifted rocks above thy stream<lb/>
O Sorgne and as I trace its silver wave along<lb/>
A scene of pastoral beauty glads my eye,<lb/>
Well suited to a pastoral poets song<lb/>
Meads that have gain'd their freshness from thy wave<lb/>
And fed upon thy dews; whitened with flocks;<lb/>
And gentle slopes where midst the broken rocks<lb/>
The vines spread forth their branches to the sun,<lb/>
As if they gain'd their nurture from his beams.<lb/>
And in the richer soil the olive turns<lb/>
Its glittering foliage from the northern blast<lb/>
Along the hills the stately villa peers<lb/>
Embosomed deep in cypress - On the plain<lb/>
The cottages are spread and many a row<lb/>
Of trees in formal trim the pruners art<lb/>
Declare Fitted for use to bear the richest fruits<lb/>

As this is the earliest bird I have seen of the<lb/>
kind in Europe I examined its caudal feathers<lb/>
with particular attention. It had no pure<lb/>
white feathers in the tail &amp; therefore its<lb/>
winter plumage does not in fact differ<lb/>
from its summer plumage. As soon as<lb/>
the birds are full grown there appear<lb/>
10 or 12 feathers of which half are<lb/>
white forming a semicircle in the tail<lb/>
&amp; which I believe are of the same<lb/>
colour &amp; appearance in both sexes<lb/>
