Fontainbleau Dec. 29[superscript]th[/superscript]-. 1813 â€“

[Horizontal rule]
The mists disperse and where a sullen cloud.
Hung on the mountains verge the Sun bursts forth.
In all its majesty of purple light,
It is a winters evening and the year
Is fast departing; yet the hues of heaven
Are bright as in the summers warmest months,
It is the season of the sleep of things
But nature in her sleep is lovely still.
The trees display no green, no forms of life,
And yet a magic foliage cloaths them round,
The purest crystals of pellucid ice
All purple in the sun-set
Amidst the wood
Fantastically rise the towering cliffs,
That in another season had been white;
But now contrasted with the brilliant ice
Shine in aerial tints of purest blue.
The varied outline has a thousand charms;
Here rises high a venerable wood
Where oaks are seen with massy ice girt round
And birches pendant with their glittering arms,
And graceful beeches clinging to the soil:
These massy forms exist of rocks alone.
Rising as if the work of human art.
The pride of some great paladin of other days
In awful ruins
Nearer I behold
The palace of a race of mighty kings,
But now another tenants. On those walls
Where erst the silver lily spread her leaves.
The graceful symbol of a brilliant court,
The golden eagle shines, the bird of prey.
Emblem of rapine and of lawless power.
Such is the fitful change of human things:
An empire rises like a cloud in heaven
Red in the morning sun, spreading its tints
Of golden hue along the feverish sky
And filling the horizon. Soon its tints
Are darkened, & it brings the thunder storm,
Lightening, and hail, and desolation comes;
But in destroying it dissolves & falls,
Never to rise.
