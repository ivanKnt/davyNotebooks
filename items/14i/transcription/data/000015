[Horizontal rule]
With joy I view thee bathed in purple light
Whilst all around is dark, With joy I see
Thee rising from thy sea of patchy clouds
Into the middle heaven.
As if a temple to th'eternal rais'd
By all the earth; framed of the pillar'd rock
And canopied with everlasting snow.
That lovely river rolling at my feet
Its bright green waves, & winding midst the rocks
Brown in their winters foliage, gain'd from thee 
Its flood of waters; and through a devious [insertion]course[/insertion] maze
Though it has lav'd the fertile plains, & wash'd
The cities walls, and mingled with the streams
Of lowland origin, yet still preserves
Its native character of mountain strength,
Its colour, and its motion. Such are those
Amongst the generations of mankind,
To whom the stream of thought descends from heaven
With all the force of reason, and the power
Of sacred genius. Through the world they pass
Still uncorrupted; and on what they take
From social life; bestow a character
Of dignity: Greater they become,
But never loose their native purity.

Banks of the Rhone.

[Horizontal rule]
The air is soft as in the month of June.
In northern climes, a balmy zephyr blows,
And nothing speaks of winters harshest month,
Save that the trees are leafless; and yon Alps
Not as in summer merely capp'd by snow,
But deep encased, and girt around by ice.
Upon the mountains crowded round thy banks,
O lovely Rhone; no ice, no snows are seen;
But lively tints and varied, such as might
Bespeak autumnal days. The oak that long
Has kept its faded foliage cloaths their base
The bracken to their sides a richer tint
Of chesnut gives, And the green herbage cloathes
Their summits, bathâ€™d in dew; save where the cliff
Uplifts its marble crest of hue diverse
And varied outline; grey with moss, or blue
In native colouring, or changed by time
And rusted by the active elements:
More lovely in decay, assuming forms
Of broken columns, & of mould'ring towers.
Thy nearest banks, O lovely river, glow
With the bright willow, round whose crimson bud
The water fly expands her glittering wings:
Thy upper slopes the graceful myrtle skirts,
Green as in spring time; and the primrose lurks
Beneath its odorous leaves. The fruitful vine
