Darkens thy champain; and on many a hill
The villages on sober colours rise.
The castles tow'ring walls, & all the tints
Which human art bestows upon the scene.
Are chaste as if the master hand of Claude
Had traced upon the canvass their design.
From the deep gullies bosom’d in thy rocks
Descends in foam & thunder, many a stream
Without a name: but one is far remov’d,
Vauclause [insertion]Sorga[/insertion]: beside whose crystal waters sung
The bard of Provence.

[Horizontal rule]
Work of a mighty people of a race
Whose monuments like those of nature last.
With wonder I behold thy columns rise
Thy mighty arches raised in triple ranks.
And not alone for use but in the form
Of perfect beauty & majestic strength
Firm as the marble rocks on which they rest
The r[insertion]R[/insertion]oman mind in all its projects grasp’d
Eternal empire looked to me decay
And work'd for generations yet unborn
Hence was its framer so lasting hence so slow
