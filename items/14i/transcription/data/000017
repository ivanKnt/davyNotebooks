The Mediterranean Pine.

[Horizontal rule]
Montpellier, Jan.-[superscript]y[/superscript] 14. 1814.

[Horizontal rule]
Thy hues are green as is the vernal tint
Of those fair meads where Isis rolls along
Her silver floods; And not amongst the snows,
Nor on the hoary mountains ruffed crest
Is thy abode; but on the gentle hill,
Amongst the rocks, and by the rivers sides
Rises thy graceful & majestic form;
Companion of the olive, & the vine,
And that Hesperian tree whose golden fruit
Demands the Zephyr warmed by southern suns.
In winter thou art verdant as in spring,
Unchangeable in beauty; & thy reign
Extends from Calpe to the Bosphorus.
Beneath thy shade the northern african
Seeks shelter from the sunshine, & the greek
In Serapis vales, forms from thy slender leaves
A shepherds coronet.
Fanes of the Gods
Of Egypt, & of Greece, majestic rise
Amidst thy shades: And to the memory,
O lovely tree, thy resting places bring
All that is noble in our history;
The schools where Socrates, & Plato taught;
