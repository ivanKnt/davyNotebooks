The Roman virtues, the Athenian art,

The light of faith; from which the [deletion]s[/deletion][insertion]S[/insertion]hepherd[deletion]s[/deletion] [superscript]x[/superscript] gave
The oracles of heaven, & Israel saw
The sacrificial off’ring of her guilt,
The blood of the atonement shed in vain,

[Horizontal rule]
In th’ eastern sky the stars their lustre loose
In more diffused light as if their orbs
Had melted into air and formed the day
Above the heavens receive a brighter tint

Framed of the morning clouds forever fixed
And gilded by th’expiring morning star,

From the mid heavens upon the tranquil sea
Without a tide whose silver mirror spreads
Reflecting forms of mountain majesty
Along th’Iberian coast & more remote
In gentle agitation feels the breeze
That to its deep & lovely azure gives
The life of motion. All the morning mists
Have vanished & the mid-day sun beams sleep
Upon thy snows or glitter where the streams
