They feed with crystal waters pour in foam

[deletion]Thy shaggy woods [/deletion] Amidst thy dark deep glens; thy shaggy woods
Where the bright pine & darker cork trees blend
Their varied foliage form a boundary.
Where winter seems to mingle with the spring
And lower still the Olive tree appears
The work of culture & the leafless vine
And the green meadow where the torrents sleep
Or move[deletion]s[/deletion] obedient to the wants of man.
Nature in savage wildness mountain strength
Breaths in one picture with the forms of art
And all that stamp the social character
A cities walls majestically rise
The guardian of a realm where sounds of war
Harm the ear Along the sandy shore
The path the Carthaginian trod appears
When from the Pyrenees his veterans pourâ€™d
To try the strength of Rome & shed profuse
Her patriot blood at lanna, On the wave
Triumphant ride the fleets of Oceans Queen
My heart throbs quicker & a healthful glow
Fills all my bosom Albion thee I hail
Mother of hero's mighty in thy strength
Deliver. From [underline]thee the fire proceeds[/underline]
[underline]Withering the tyrant, Not a fire alone[/underline]
[underline]Of war destructive but a loving light[/underline]
[underline]Of honor glory & security[/underline]
[underline]A light of Science liberty & peace.[/underline]

Evening

[Horizontal rule]
A moment past, the sky was bright & clear
But now a mist obscures the ambient air;
The mist becomes a cloud which gathers round
Thy brow. At first [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]so[/insertion] white so bright so fierce
The snows seem dark beneath its crisped fringe
And now it spreads a thicker canopy,
And rapidly descends & fill thy glens,
And covers all thy rocks. Its tints are changed
Its fleecy whiteness gone. The sun beams fade
And loose their glory in its sullen gloom
Portentous of the storm. And now the rain
Descends in floods the angry lightning gleams,
The thunder roars. The tempest howls along
Thy echoing cliffs & the vexed main
Mingles her white foam with the troubled floods
The torrents of the mountain roll along.
