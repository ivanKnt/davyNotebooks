I see the rifted rocks above thy stream
O Sorgne and as I trace its silver wave along
A scene of pastoral beauty glads my eye,
Well suited to a pastoral poets song
Meads that have gain'd their freshness from thy wave
And fed upon thy dews; whitened with flocks;
And gentle slopes where midst the broken rocks
The vines spread forth their branches to the sun,
As if they gain'd their nurture from his beams.
And in the richer soil the olive turns
Its glittering foliage from the northern blast
Along the hills the stately villa peers
Embosomed deep in cypress - On the plain
The cottages are spread and many a row
Of trees in formal trim the pruners art
Declare Fitted for use to bear the richest fruits
Pomona culls, or for the verdant food 

Of that fair insect daughter of the spring
Whose industry supplies the Cimbrian looms.
I walk along thy banks and now thy streams

Descend[deletion]s[/deletion] with more of power and sparkling foam
Amidst their basons: awful cliffs impend
Above thy channel raise in many a form

Fantastical of spires and gothic towers
And airy battlements as if in sport
Nature in humouring her plastic strength
In playful mood had framed them In a dark
And gloomy chasm filled with broken rocks
I see the white spray rise in many a cloud
And now I hear the thund'ring cataract.
It is thy lofty spring O wondrous stream
Born of the mountain snows thy course is made
In darkness and in silence deeply hid
Within thy channel of the marble rock
And all at once those risest unto light
Pure as if fresh from heaven Embosom'd long
In earth thou [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]hast[/insertion] no earthly taint. Thy [deletion]tints[/deletion][insertion]hues[/insertion]

Seem stolen from [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]ethereal[/insertion] sky [deletion]so bright[/deletion]
[deletion]Their bright[/deletion] [insertion]So bright[/insertion] so pure their azure; and thy foam
Is whiter than the snow that gave thee birth
In thunder thou descendest from thy rocks

 Nor dost thou sleep beneath them murmuring [insertion]still[/insertion]
Along thy pebbly bed garnished with plants
Growing amidst thy waters mingling hues.
Of Emerald with thy transparent blue

I wonder not the poet loved thy wave
Thy cavern'd rocks thy giant precipice
For such a scene was suited well to break
The tyrants spell of love: and to [deletion]subdue[/deletion] [insertion]controul[/insertion]
A passion that was often hopeless love
Called for impressions strong & vigorous
Such as this scene sublime might well bestow
Upon a mind alive to sympathy
With all created forms that b[deletion]ea[/deletion][insertion]o[/insertion]r[insertion]e[/insertion] the stamp
Of loveliness or Majesty or Grace.
