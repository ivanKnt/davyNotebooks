[underline]Carrara[/underline]
Thine is no dark and dreary mine
No hidden [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]quarry[/insertion] damp and cold
Thy crests in Orient sun beams shine
The morning tints thy rocks in gold
Thy rocks sublime that still remain
As erst from Chaos they arose
Untouched by time without its stain
Pure as their canopy of snows.
Forms worthy of that magic art
Which [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]by[/insertion] the gravers potent hand
Can bid the [deletion]forms[/deletion] [insertion]lines[/insertion] of beauty start
And all expressions power command
Forms worthy of that master skill
Which to the poets dream has given
The [deletion]noble form[/deletion] [insertion]unconquered strength[/insertion] the Potent will
Fixed in the majesty of heaven. -
And that a softer charm has shed
On Cytherias radiant head
And kindled in her grecian face
The immortality of grace.-
Scenes blended with the memory
Of mighty works can well supply
The food of thought; & scenes like these
Have other natural powers to please
Around transparent rivers flow
Whose tints are bright as summer sky
Upon their banks the olives grow
The greener pine aspiring high
Towers midst the cliffs. The chestnut loves
Th[insertion]y[/insertion] slopes, where vines their tendrils rear.
In the deep glen the myrtle groves
Embalm the cool and quiet air.
