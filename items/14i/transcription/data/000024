I admire thy wandering

[unclear]xxxx[/unclear], thy [deletion]whit[/deletion] dancing course,
Whether a [deletion][unclear]swift[/unclear][/deletion] placid stream, or turbulent force
[deletion]I love thy wild &[/deletion][insertion]I love thee midst[/insertion] [deletion]rocky basins [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
Whether [deletion]bursting from[/deletion] thy cloud capt mountains
Where thy [insertion]moss stained[/insertion] dark impetuous fountains
[deletion]Fall over the rock in foam and thunder[/deletion]
Oer rocks their [insertion]power[/insertion] [deletion]force &[/deletion] [insertion]might[/insertion] [unclear]sexxx[/unclear] to sunder
Fall wildly down in foam & thunder
I love thee
[deletion]Or[/deletion] when thy placid waters sleep.
Beneath the Castles dungeon keep.
[unclear]close to[/unclear] [deletion]Or by[/deletion] the abbies and wells.
Or where by Rokebys classic [deletion]wall[/deletion] halls
[insertion]The Greta harm in flood & foam[/insertion]
Thy streams in rocky basins [insertion]foam[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] from glen[/deletion]

And then for me there is a higher charm
Of long remembered kindness, [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] warm
