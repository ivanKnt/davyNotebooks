Dies irae
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

I walked in the park the evening was bright
& balmy, the moon full, my heart became
softened & my feelings less painful & intense

1Aχω την [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] Αακρσω [deletion]ten[/deletion] [insertion]την φιλτατην͵[/insertion] 12 o'Clock midnight

Μὴ λεγε θνάσκειν Την αγαθην 
Nine years, a joy, a pure delight
She dwelt upon my raptured sight
When present: and in absence gave
A hope which made my heart her slave
A hallowed hope, the Saint might own
Bending before the virgin mother [insertion]A hallowed[/insertion]

And in her sanctity alone [insertion]hope[/insertion]
Seeking all earthly love to smother,
Or rather to exalt refine
The Earthly fire to love divine
[deletion]But she [unclear]her[/unclear][/deletion], [insertion] Alass her form of loveliest[/insertion] [deletion]lovely[/deletion] mold
Is now insensate dark & cold, 
Her pulse is fluttering failing fast
And now her heart must beat its last
Her breathing seems in haste to fly.
Too weak too faint to form a sigh 
Her frame [underline]obeys mortality[/underline]
