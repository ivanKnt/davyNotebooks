But the pure & sacred fire
Which warmed her mind can not expire,

It kindles, breathes & lives with me
[underline]In every form & memory.[/underline] In everlasting sympathy

The breath that cools her Zephyrs wing

Is of her eternal spring
The evenings soft & dewy calm
Is of her hope, bestowing balm.
The morns reflected lovely light
Is of her sunshine heavenly bright
The stars amidst the azure sky
Speak of her [deletion]truth &[/deletion] [insertion]glorious[/insertion] constancy. [insertion]m[/insertion]
[deletion]Of flames that will not cannot die[/deletion]

And powers [deletion]of immortality[/deletion] [underline]above mortality[/underline].
