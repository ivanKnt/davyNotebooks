There never was a Man of more amiable benevolent

character than Morichini & His principal discovery 

shews an acuteness & originality not usual now in his 

countrymen.

To go back to France. Gay Lussac was quick

lively [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] ingenious & profound with great

activity of mind & great facility of manipulation
I would place him at the head of the living
chemists of France. It is true He has worked
with Then[insertion]a[/insertion]rd & they have formed for themselves
as it were one reputation. [deletion]but[/deletion] Gay Lussac however
is the superior Man. but I I have heard Thenard
much admired as an eloquent lecturer
Madame Gay Lussac in 1820 was a lively pleasing
woman, a little passed the age of coquettry
if a French woman can be ever said to be passed
that age. Madame Thenard was a charming little
brune with a most graceful figure & a countenance
full of character. She was amiable & I believe
extremely “sage”.
