from Eubathes, from the days even of the Labels & modes

of [unclear]xxx[/unclear] of the sentient principle?
[underline]Even the appetite when satisfied[/underline]

rewards of the good in pure intellectual

with the meeting of the five friends & a
enjoyment [deletion]fo[/deletion] how transient ever from
their nature are all sensual pleasures
When appetites satisfied & when satisfied [underline]Satiated[/underline]
