his love for chemists by marrying his daughter to M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Brande. [deletion]the Son of a German Apothecary[/deletion].She was a
charming little woman. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Brande was not I think
worthy of her. being a very inferior person. & He followed
Chemistry always as [insertion][deletion]a German[/deletion] as a metier[/insertion][deletion]an Apothecary might be expected[/deletion]

[deletion]to do[/deletion] for small distinctions & as much profit as He
could obtain. Berzelius has put him in the same
line with M[superscript]r[/superscript] Accum This I think unfair Accum
was both a cheat & a quack. Brande had the

manner of a Gentleman & was I believe perfectly
honorable in conduct: but a coxcomb in dress &
manner. & as a journalist illiberal or perhaps rather
[underline]careless[/underline] [insertion]careless[/insertion] He had so little tact that He was not
aware of the effects of certain criticisms & allowed
them to be inserted from open enemies of the Authors
attached.
Berzelius was the worthy countryman of Scheele
& certainly one of the great Chemists of the age
Indefatigable in labour, accurate in manipulation
