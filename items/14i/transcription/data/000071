no one has worked with more profit. His manner
was not distinguished, [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] his appearance rather
coarse & his conversation was limited much
to his own subjects. [underline]Orsted[/underline] is chiefly
distinguished by his discovery of Electromagnetism
He was a man of simple manners & of no pretensions
& not of extensive resources; but ingenious & a little
of a German metaphysician. Gauss appeared to me

a very superior man. I met him at the house
of Olbers at Bremen a delightful old philosopher
with a passion for Astronomy only surpassed in ardour,

by that possessed by [underline]Schumacher[/underline]. I was
equally pleased with the manners - with the

liberality & social gaiety of these three
celebrated men with whom I spent one of 
the most agreeable days belonging to the later
period of my life. â€“
