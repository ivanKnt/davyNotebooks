never disposed to offer the compliment of the

French man in reply to a person who begged

tout au contraire. The scientific taste 

in America seems to me almost always con-

history they have gone very little way

tho their oportunities have been very great

This has probably arisen in some measure

yet no great philosopher born in the American

states for Franklin as well as Washington
