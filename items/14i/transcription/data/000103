as if to divert the attention of the intruder, a few
snipes always breed in the marshes of [underline]England[/underline] &
Scotland but a far greater number retire for 
this purpose to the Hebrides & the Orkneys
In the hether surrounding a small lake in the Island of

Hoy in the Orkneys I found in the month of August
of 1817 the nests of 10 or 12 couple of snipes. I was
grouseshooting & my dog continually pointed
[deletion]to young snipes which[/deletion] [insertion]them and[/insertion] as these were some
times three young ones & two old ones in
the nest [insertion]this[/insertion] had a most powerful scent, from
some accident of the season these snipes
were very late in being hatched for they
usually fly before the middle of July but
this year even as late as the 15 of August

there were many young snipes that had not 
yet their wing feathers. Snipes are usually
fattest in frosty weather; which I believe is owing to this
that [deletion]they[/deletion] in such weather they haunt only warm springs
where worms are abundant & they do not willingly quit
these places: [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] so that they have plenty of nourishment
