& Brittany the woods of England particularly of the 

west & south contain allways a certain quantity
of woodcocks but these are far more in the moist
soil & warmer climate of Ireland, but in the woods
of Italy[superscript]2[/superscript] southern & Greece near marshes they are far
more abundant & they extend in quantities over the
greek islands, Asia Minor & Northern Africa
The snipe is one of the most generally distri-
=buted birds belonging to Europe. It feeds upon almost
every kind of worm or larv√¶ & as I have said
before its stomach sometimes contains seeds &
rice, it prefers a country cold in the summer
to breed in; but wherever there is much [insertion]fluid[/insertion] water &
great morasses this bird is almost certain to
be found. Its nest is very inartificial, its eggs
large & the young ones soon become of an enormous
size being often before they can fly larger than
their parents Two young ones are usually the
number in a nest but I have seen three. The
old birds are exceedingly attached to their off-
spring & if any one approaches near the nest
they make a loud & drumming noise above the head.
