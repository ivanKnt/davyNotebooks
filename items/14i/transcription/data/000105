A laurel or a holly bush is a favourite place for
their [deletion]diurnal[/deletion] repose. The thick & varnished leaves of those
trees prevents the radiation of heat from the soil &
they are less affected by the refrigerating influence of
a clear sky so that they afford a warm seat for
the woodcock. Woodcocks usually begin to fly north
on the first approach of spring & their flights are gener-
ally longer & their rests fewer at this season than
in the autumn. In the autumn they are driven

food & they stop [insertion]stop[/insertion] wherever they can find food. In
the spring, there is the influence of another power-

migrate in pairs & pass as speedily as possible to the
place where they are likely to find food & to raise
their young & of which the old birds have already
