This day Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] 20 - The [unclear]flames escaped[/unclear] about

2 square yards & the stones in the centre
were glowing, the smell was like that of

burning olefiant gas mixed with a little odour
of petroleum there were many smaller
flares very feeble round it its colour
was reddish. - there was much charcoal
deposited up on the hot stones near it
but on putting a cold stone [deletion]near[/deletion]
[deletion]it[/deletion] in the flame it was not reduced
hence probably the C is from
decomposition of gas â€“ I extinguished
