As the attraction of Barytes for water is 
very much at high heat, where the [unclear]volatity[/unclear]
of the water is amazingly increased under common
pressure so the attraction of alumine &
silex for water under high heat where there is great
pressure may be sufficient to occasion first the 
formation of a hydrate & afterwards of a solution
that Alumine can combine with water formed
by Wavellite - & as carbonic acid dissolves
lime so under greater pressure may water
dissolve the Earths - Now is it necessary
to prove this view that the Earths found
in veins should be hydrates for there
are many instances of dissolution where the
