[Horizontal rule]
The mists disperse and where a sullen cloud.
Hung on the mountains verge the Sun bursts forth.
In all its majesty of purple light,
It is a winters evening and the year
Is fast departing; yet the hues of heaven
Are bright as in the summers warmest months,
It is the season of the sleep of things
But nature in her sleep is lovely still.
The trees display no green, no forms of life,
And yet a magic foliage cloaths them round,
The purest crystals of pellucid ice
All purple in the sun-set
Amidst the wood
Fantastically rise the towering cliffs,
That in another season had been white;
But now contrasted with the brilliant ice
Shine in aerial tints of purest blue.
The varied outline has a thousand charms;
Here rises high a venerable wood
Where oaks are seen with massy ice girt round
And birches pendant with their glittering arms,
And graceful beeches clinging to the soil:
These massy forms exist of rocks alone.
Rising as if the work of human art.
The pride of some great paladin of other days
In awful ruins
Nearer I behold
The palace of a race of mighty kings,
But now another tenants. On those walls
Where erst the silver lily spread her leaves.
The graceful symbol of a brilliant court,
The golden eagle shines, the bird of prey.
Emblem of rapine and of lawless power.
Such is the fitful change of human things:
An empire rises like a cloud in heaven
Red in the morning sun, spreading its tints
Of golden hue along the feverish sky
And filling the horizon. Soon its tints
Are darkened, & it brings the thunder storm,
Lightening, and hail, and desolation comes;
But in destroying it dissolves & falls,
Never to rise.

With joy I view thee bathed in purple light
Whilst all around is dark, With joy I see
Thee rising from thy sea of patchy clouds
Into the middle heaven.
As if a temple to th'eternal rais'd
By all the earth; framed of the pillar'd rock
And canopied with everlasting snow.
That lovely river rolling at my feet
Its bright green waves, & winding midst the rocks
Brown in their winters foliage, gain'd from thee 
Its flood of waters; and through a devious [insertion]course[/insertion] maze
Though it has lav'd the fertile plains, & wash'd
The cities walls, and mingled with the streams
Of lowland origin, yet still preserves
Its native character of mountain strength,
Its colour, and its motion. Such are those
Amongst the generations of mankind,
To whom the stream of thought descends from heaven
With all the force of reason, and the power
Of sacred genius. Through the world they pass
Still uncorrupted; and on what they take
From social life; bestow a character
Of dignity: Greater they become,
But never loose their native purity.

And nothing speaks of winters harshest month,
Save that the trees are leafless; and yon [place]place_247|Alps[/place]

But lively tints and varied, such as might
Bespeak autumnal days. The oak that long
Has kept its faded foliage cloaths their base
The bracken to their sides a richer tint
Of chesnut gives, And the green herbage cloathes
Their summits, bath’d in dew; save where the cliff
Uplifts its marble crest of hue diverse
And varied outline; grey with moss, or blue
In native colouring, or changed by time
And rusted by the active elements:
More lovely in decay, assuming forms
Of broken columns, & of mould'ring towers.
Thy nearest banks, O lovely river, glow
With the bright willow, round whose crimson bud
The water fly expands her glittering wings:
Thy upper slopes the graceful myrtle skirts,
Green as in spring time; and the primrose lurks
Beneath its odorous leaves. The fruitful vine

And fed upon thy dews; whitened with flocks;

Its glittering foliage from the northern blast

Declare Fitted for use to bear the richest fruits

[underline]Dialogue 5 The Chemical[/underline]

[underline][deletion]The character of the Chemist[/deletion][/underline] –
[Horizontal rule]
I had been made religious by the conversations
of [person]person_101|Ambrosio[/person] in [place]place_097|Italy[/place]. My faith was strengthened
or exalted by the opinions of the unknown
For when I had not merely that veneration
awakened by exalted talents but a strong affection
founded upon the essential benefit of the preser-
vation of my life owing to him I ventured [deletion]to ask[/deletion]
[insertion]the evening after our visit to the cave of [place]place_1248|Adelsberg[/place] to ask him[/insertion]
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] some questions relating to his history & adventures
He said to attempt to give you any ideas of the 
formation of my character would lead me into the
history of my youth which almost approaches
a tale of romance. The source of the little infor=

mation & intelligence I possess I must refer to a restless ac-
tivity of spirit a love of glory which even belonged
to my infancy, & a sensibility easily excited & not
easily conquered.
My parentage was humble yet I can believe a traditional
history of my paternal grandmother that the origin or our
family was from an old noble norman stock. I formed
[deletion]the believe[/deletion] [insertion]this belief[/insertion] upon certain feelings which I can only refer to an
hereditary source a pride [deletion]attached[/deletion] [insertion]of decorum a tact[/insertion] & a refinement
even in [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] early infancy[/deletion] [insertion]boyhood[/insertion] & which are contradictory to 
the idea of my origin from a race of peasants.
Accident opened to me in early youth a philosophical
career which I pursued with success. In manhood for-
tune smiled upon me & made me independant. [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]-
rially became a philosopher & pursued my travels
with the object of instructing myself & of benefiting 
mankind. I have seen most parts of Europe & conver[insertion]s[/insertion]ed
I believe with all the illustrious men of science
belonging to there. My life has not been unlike that

of the ancient greek sages. - I have added some little to
the stock of human Knowledge & I have endeavoured
to add something to the quantity of human happin
=ess. In my early life I was a sceptic I have infor
-med you how I became a believer & I constantly
bless the supreme Intelligence for the favour of some
gleams of divine light which have been vouchsafed
to me in this our state of darkness & doubt.
[underline]Milauths[/underline]. I am surprized that with your powers
you did not enter into a professional [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] either of
law or of politicks: you would have gained the
highest honors of distinction.
The [underline]Unknown[/underline]. To me there has never been a higher
source of honor or distinction than [deletion]those[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] connected
with advances in science. I have not possessed enough
of the eagle in my character to make a direct
flight to the loftiest altitudes in the social world.
& I certainly never endeavoured to reach those heights
by using the creeping powers of the reptile who in
ascending generally chooses the dirtiest path

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00042|000043|000043[/page]
because it is the easiest -
[underline][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/underline]. I have often wondered that men of fortune
& of rank do not apply themselves more to phi-
losophical pursuits: they affect a delightful & an enviable
road to distinction, one furnished upon the blessings
[deletion]confer[/deletion] of benefits conferred on our [underline]fellow[/underline] creatures.
[deletion]They It does not offer[/deletion] [insertion]they do not supply[/insertion] the same sources of temporary po-
=pularity [insertion]as successes in the senate or at the bar[/insertion] but the glory resulting from them
is permanent, & independant of vulgar taste or
caprice. In looking back to the history of the last
five reigns in [place]place_121|England[/place] we find Boyles’ [person]person_026|Cavendish[/person]'s
& [person]person_151|Howards[/person] who rendered those great names more
illustrious by their scientific honors but we may in 
vain search the aristocracy now for philosophers & there 
are very few persons who pursue science with
true dignity; it is followed more as connected
with objects of profit than those of fame & there 
are fifty persons who take out [deletion]a[/deletion] patent[insertion]s[/insertion] for [deletion]a[/deletion]
supposed inventions to one who makes a real

[underline]Phil[/underline]. The information we have already
received from you proves to me that [underline]Chemistry[/underline]
has been your favourite pursuit. I am surprised
at this. The higher mathematics & pure physics
appear to me to offer much more noble objects
of contemplation & fields of discovery & practically
considered the results of the Chemist are
much more humble, belonging principally to
The Apothecaries shop or the Kitchin.
[unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] I feel disposed to join you in attacking
this favorite study of our friend: but merely
to provoke him to defend it I [deletion]should[/deletion] wish
our attack would induce him to defend
his science & that we might enjoy a little

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00044|000045|000045[/page]
of the sport of literary Gladiators, at least
in order to call forth his skill & awaken
his eloquence.
The Unknown, I have no objection. Let them
in a fair description, remember we fight
only with foils & the point of mine shall
be covered with velvet
-In your attack on Chemistry [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear], You

in years I think nearly 70 & in bad health - His conversation
was not brilliant. His views rather limited but [deletion]not[/deletion]
marking great ingenuity. His manners were perfectly
simple. He had not the air of a courtier nor even of
a Man who had seen the world. - Indeed I [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] can

To go back to France. [person]person_012|Gay Lussac[/person] was quick
lively [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] ingenious & profound with great
activity of mind & great facility of manipulation
I would place him at the head of the living

with Then[insertion]a[/insertion]rd & they have formed for themselves
as it were one reputation. [deletion]but[/deletion] [person]person_012|Gay Lussac[/person] however

much admired as an eloquent lecturer
[person]person_1011|Madame Gay Lussac[/person] in 1820 was a lively pleasing
woman, a little passed the age of coquettry
if a French woman can be ever said to be passed
that age. [person]person_1012|Madame Thenard[/person] was a charming little
brune with a most graceful figure & a countenance
full of character. She was amiable & I believe
extremely “sage”.

[underline][person]person_202|Arago[/person][/underline] like a Spaniard in Countenance had a little
of the reserve & dignity of manner belonging to that 
nation. He was I believe from Rompilieu or the neighborhood
of [underline]the[/underline] pyr[deletion]y[/deletion]enees. He appeared to me candid in judgement
& accurate as an observer & experimenter. He was 
almost constantly in [underline]discussion[/underline] with [person]person_203|Biot[/person] upon some
points of Scontested discovery & I felt always disposed
to think him in the right. He seemed to me to 
have so much more steadiness of character. [person]person_203|Biot[/person]
was mobile active ingenious & laborious; but had
a restlessness not free from [insertion]obvious[/insertion] vanity [person]person_1013|Madame Arago[/person]

was lively ready & various in her conversational
powers -
[person]person_029|Beddoes[/person] was reserved in manner & almost shy; but his
countenance was very agreable. He [underline]was cold[/underline] in conversation
& apparently much occupied with his own peculiar views

which was [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] as practical as [person]person_240|Darwins[/person]. [underline]He[/underline] was little
enlightened by experiment & I may say little attentive to it
He had great talents & much reading; but had lived
too little amongst superior men. On his death bed He
wrote me a most affecting letter regretting his scientific
aberrations I remember one "expression" like one who has
scattered abroad the avena fatua of knowledge from
which neither branch nor blossom nor fruit has resulted.
I require the consolation of a friend". Beddoes had talents
which would have excelled him to the pinnacle of philosophical 
eminence if they had been applied with discretion.
De [person]person_271|Humboldt[/person] was one of the most agreeable Men I
have ever known social, [deletion]conviviable[/deletion] modest, full of

in conversation. His travels display his spirit of
enterprise His works are monuments of the variety

that having promised his vote to a person as Cor. Member of

his daughter in law was a charming conversible little
Woman with various talents & quick good nature & was more
agreable than if she had been a great beauty.
Banks was a good humoured and literal Man free &
various in conversational power, a tolerable botanist
& generally acquainted with Natural History, He had not
much reading; & no profound information - He was
always ready to promote the objects of Men of Science; but
He required to be regarded as a Patron & readily swallowed
gross flattery. - When He gave anecdotes of his voyages
He was very entertaining & unaffected - A Courtier in
character He was a warm friend of a good King. In his
relations to the Royal Society, He was too personal &
made his House & circle too like a court. – 
[person]person_026|Cavendish[/person] was a great Man with extraordinary

He was afraid of strangers & seemed when embarrassed
even to articulate with difficulty. He wore the costume

& seemed to take an interest in them; but He encouraged

Man, a quaker by profession & practice He had none of
the manners or ways of the world. A tolerable
Mathematician He gained his livelihood I belive by
teaching the mathematics to young people. He pursued
science always with mathematical views. He seemed little
attentive to the labour of others except when they
countenanced or confirmed his own [deletion]views[/deletion] [insertion]ideas[/insertion]. It is difficult
to say how He gained his first notions of atoms; but
I strongly suspect [deletion]a work which I published[/deletion] [insertion]that [deletion]from[/deletion] Researches Chem & Philosophic published[/insertion] in180[deletion]0[/deletion][insertion]1[/insertion].
in which [deletion]it[/deletion] it is stated that [chemical]chemical_094|Nitrate of Ammonia[/chemical]

He always referred to those [deletion]works[/deletion] [insertion]labours[/insertion] in his early papers; but 
afterwards seemed to have forgotten them He probably
had seen the works of [misc]misc_604|the two Higgins[/misc]. but I do

[underline]Conclusion of the sixth Dialogue[/underline]
[deletion][underline][misc]misc_063|Eubathes[/misc][/underline][/deletion][insertion]Philaletes[/insertion]. Your history of the laws of the inevitable
destruction of material forms recals to my
memory our description at [place]place_1248|Adelsberg[/place]. The
changes of the material universe are in
harmony with those [deletion]of[/deletion] which belong to the
human body & which you suppose to be the
frame or machinery of the sentient principle.
May we not venture to inquire that the visible
& tangible world with which we are acquainted
by our sensations bear the same relation to the
divine & infinite intelligence that our organs
bear to our mind, with the only difference
that in the changes of the divine system
there is no decay, there being in the [deletion]system[/deletion] order
[insertion]of things[/insertion] a perfect unity & all the powers springing
from one will & being [deletion]on[/deletion] a consequence of that

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00058|000059|000059[/page]
will are perfectly & unalterably balanced. [person]person_036|Newton[/person]
seemed to apprehend that in the laws of the
planetary motions there was a principle which
would ultimately be the cause of the destruction
of the system, [person]person_130|La Place[/person] by pursuing & refining
the principles of our great Philosopher has proved
that what appeared sources of dis[deletion]c[/deletion]ord[insertion]er[/insertion] are in
fact the perfecting machinery of the system; &
that the principle of conservation is as eternal
as that of motion.
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. I dare not offer any speculations
on this grand & awful subject. We can hardly
comprehend the cause of a simple atmospheric
phaenomenon such as the fall of a heavy body
from a Meteor. We cannot even embrace in
one view the millionth part of the objects
surrounding us & yet we have the presumption
to reason upon the infinite universe &

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00059|000060|000060[/page]
49
the eternal mind by which it was created & governed.
On these subjects, I have no confidence in reason, I trust
only to faith & as far as we ought to enquire
we have no other guide but revelation. – 
[underline]Philalithes[/underline]. I agree with you that whenever we
attempt metaphysical speculations we must begin
with a foundation of faith - that key [deletion]light by[/deletion] sure from
revelation that God is [deletion]ever[/deletion] omniscient & omnipotent
it appears to me no improper use of our faculties
to trace even in the material universe the acts
of his power & the results of his wisdom & to draw
parallels from the infinite to the finite mind. Remember
we are taught that “Man was created in the image
of God. " – & I think it cannot be doubted that in
the progress of society man has been made [insertion]a[/insertion] great sustain
-ment by his energies & labours for improving the
moral universe; Compare the Greeks & Romans with the
Assyrians & Babylonians & the ancient Greeks & Romans with 
the nations of modern Christendom & it cannot I think

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00060|000061|000061[/page]
be questioned that there has been a great superiority
in the later nations & that their improvements have
been subservient to the more exalted state of intellectual
& religious existence. If this little globe has been so
modified by its most powerful & active inhabitants I can-
-not help thinking that in other systems beings of a
superior nature under the influence of the divine
will may act higher parts. We know from the
sacred writings that there are intelligences of a
higher nature than man & I cannot help some-
-times referring [insertion]to[/insertion] my vision in the [place]place_199|Coloseum[/place] & in sup-
-posing some acts of power by these Ginis & Seraphs
similar to those which I have imagined in the higher
planetary systems. There is [deletion]great[/deletion] [insertion]much[/insertion] reason to [deletion]believe[/deletion] [insertion]suppose[/insertion]
from astronomical observations that great changes
take place in the system of the fixed stars. Sir
[person]person_089|William Herschel[/person] indeed seems to have believed that
he saw [deletion]a[/deletion] nebulous or luminous matter in the
progress of forming suns & there are some astronomers
who believe that stars have been extinct but it is more

probable that they have disappeared from peculiar
motions. It is perhaps rather a poetical than a
philosophical idea yet I cannot help forming the
opinion that [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc] or seraphic intelligences may in
-habit these systems & may be the ministers of the
eternal mind in producing changes in them similar
to those which have taken place on the earth.
Time is almost a human word & change entirely a
human idea. In the system of nature we should
rather say progress than change. The sun appears
to sink in the ocean in darkness but it rises in another
hemisphere. The suns of a city fall but they are
often used to [deletion]regenerate[/deletion] [insertion]form[/insertion] most magnificent structures
as at [place]place_155|Rome[/place], but even when they are destroyed so as
to form only dust nature asserts her empire over
them & the vegetable world rises in constant youth
& in a period of annual [unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] by the labours of
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] man providing food vitality & beauty upon the
wrecks of monuments which were once raised for
purposes of glory but which are now applied to 
objects of utility.

[person]person_036|Newton[/person] had expressed his views [insertion]almost[/insertion] as well as he could express
them himself. Whatever came into his mind [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
from any source. He seemed always to consider as his own
property. He was a very disinterested man, seemed
to have no ambition beyond that of being thought
a great Philosopher. He was a very coarse 
Experimenter & almost always found the results
He required. Trusting to his head rather than to
his hand. - Memory & observation were subordinate
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] qualities in his mind. He followed with
ardour analogies & inductions & however his claims
to originality may admit of question. I have no
doubt that He was [insertion]one of[/insertion] the most original philosophers of
his time & one of the most ingenious. – 
[person]person_150|Wollaston[/person] may be compared to [person]person_066|Dalton[/person] for originality of view
& was far his superior in accuracy. He was an admirable
manipulator, steady cautious & sure. His judgement was

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00068|000069|000069[/page]
cool.- His views sagacious - His inductions made
with care slowly formed & seldom renounced. He had 
much of the same spirit of philosophy as [person]person_026|Cavendish[/person]. – 
[insertion]But unlike [person]person_026|Cavendish[/person][/insertion] He applied Science to purposes of profit & for
many years sold manufactured [chemical]chemical_369|Platinum[/chemical]. He died
very rich. Some accidental annoyances in the
medical profession made him I think jealous
& reserved in the earlier part of his life: but latterly
He [unclear]xx[/unclear] become far more agreable & confiding &
was a warm & kind friend & a pleasant social
companion. – 
[person]person_149|Hatchett[/person] was a lively & agreable Man without
much firmness of character, good natured conversible
& with great variety of information. In early life He
had been an active & accurate chemist, but I do
not think had any love of the Science except on account
of the distinction it procured him. He however shewed

[page]69|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00069|000070|000070[/page]
61
his love for chemists by marrying his [person]person_1016|daughter to M[superscript]r[/superscript][line]Brande[/person]. [deletion]the Son of a German Apothecary[/deletion].She was a
charming little woman. [person]person_207|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Brande[/person] was not I think
worthy of her. being a very inferior person. & He followed
Chemistry always as [insertion][deletion]a German[/deletion] as a metier[/insertion][deletion]an Apothecary might be expected[/deletion]
[deletion]to do[/deletion] for small distinctions & as much profit as He
could obtain. [person]person_349|Berzelius[/person] has put him in the same
line with [person]person_472|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Accum[/person] This I think unfair Accum
was both a cheat & a quack. Brande had the
manner of a Gentleman & was I believe perfectly
honorable in conduct: but a coxcomb in dress &
manner. & as a journalist illiberal or perhaps rather
[underline]careless[/underline] [insertion]careless[/insertion] He had so little tact that He was not
aware of the effects of certain criticisms & allowed
them to be inserted from [misc]misc_605|open enemies of the Authors[/misc]
attached.
[person]person_349|Berzelius[/person] was the worthy countryman of Scheele
& certainly one of the great Chemists of the age
Indefatigable in labour, accurate in manipulation

[page]70|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00070|000071|000071[/page]
no one has worked with more profit. His manner
was not distinguished, [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] his appearance rather
coarse & his conversation was limited much
to his own subjects. [person]person_888|[underline]Orsted[/underline][/person] is chiefly
distinguished by his discovery of Electromagnetism
He was a man of simple manners & of no pretensions
& not of extensive resources; but ingenious & a little
of a German metaphysician. [person]person_168|Gauss[/person] appeared to me
a very superior man. I met him at the house
of [person]person_167|Olbers[/person] at [place]place_963|Bremen[/place] a delightful old philosopher
with a passion for Astronomy only surpassed in ardour,
by that possessed by [person]person_169|[underline]Schumacher[/underline][/person]. I was
equally pleased with the manners - with the
liberality & social gaiety of these three
celebrated men with whom I spent one of 
the most agreeable days belonging to the later
period of my life. –

I must not pass by [person]person_209|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Young[/person] called Phenomenon Young
at [place]place_323|Cambridge[/place] - a Man of universal erudition
& almost universal accomplishments. Had he
limited himself to any one department of knowledge
He must have been first in that department. 
But as a Mathematician & [deletion][unclear]xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] scholar 
a Hieroglyphist He was eminent & He knew so
much that it is difficult to say what He did
not know. He was a most admirable & good tempered
Man. a little [insertion]too[/insertion] fond [insertion]perhaps of the[/insertion] [deletion]of running after the[/deletion] society of
persons of rank for a true philosopher. -
[person]person_015|Pepys[/person] was a cutler in the poultry & one of the best
& warmest hearted Men I ever knew with an ardent
zeal for science & great [deletion]candour[/deletion] [insertion]fervour[/insertion] in pursuit [insertion]of scientific objects[/insertion] [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] warmth
of character. Men who did not know him well were
apt to be annoyed by his citizen like manners, those
with whom he was intimate could not fail of
admiring & loving him. [person]person_003|Allen[/person] was a benevolent

[page]72|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00072|000073|000073[/page]
quaker always employed upon good & useful plans
& I believe one [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] of the most conscientious as well 
[deletion]amiable as well[/deletion] one of the most amiable of Men. – 
He [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] & [person]person_015|Pepys[/person] made some good & accurate
chemical experiments together. – [person]person_160|Buckland[/person] was
a lively & clever Oxonian who pursued geology
with great ardour & success popular as a
lecturer & a writer & thoroughly amiable Man.
[person]person_210|[underline]Babington[/underline][/person], the best & warmest hearted frie[deletion]nd[/deletion] the
kindest Husband & father [insertion]& perhaps[/insertion] the most disinterested physician
of his [insertion]time[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] with good talents & a fine tact

his patients. – 
For the characters of some other philosophers
who had departed from this our Scene of 
action before these pages were written I
refer to the annual discourses read

since 1821 to the Royal Society. I particu-
-larly wish to mention [person]person_089|those of Herschel[/person]
[person]person_194|Jenner[/person]. [person]person_195|Baylie[/person] & [person]person_196|Marcet[/person]. I shall give
a few gleanings more from the scientific
& literary academics. [person]person_157|Ampere[/person] was a
mathematician of various resources & I
think might rather be called excentric
than original. He was as it were always
mounted upon a hobby horse of a mon-
-strous character pursuing the most re-
=mote & distant analogies. His hobby
horse was sometimes like that of a child
made of heavy wood, at other times it resembled
[deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]loose[/insertion] chasses used in the Laudes & at other
times it was like a [misc]misc_613|hyppogrif[/misc] in a [deletion]magie[/deletion]
pantomime [insertion]de magie[/insertion]. He had a sort of faith in
animal magnetism & has published
some refined & ingenious memoirs to prove

[page]74|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00074|000075|000075[/page]
the identity of electricity & magnetism
but even in these views he is rather as I
said before excentric than original. He
has always appeared to me to possess a
very disc[deletion]o[/deletion]ursive imagination & but little
accuracy of [deletion]exp[/deletion] observation [insertion]or[/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] acuteness
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]of[/insertion] research. -
[person]person_050|Vauquelin[/person] was in the decline of life when I
first saw him in 1813, a man who gave
one the idea of the [misc]misc_012|French chemists[/misc] of
another age belonging almost [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] more to
the pharmaceutical laboratory than to the
philosophical and yet he lived in the [place]place_1184|Jardin[line]du Roi[/place]. Nothing could be more singular than his man-
ners, his life & his menage. Two old maiden ladies The
[misc]misc_606|Mademoiselles Fourcroy[/misc] sisters of the professor of
that name kept his house. I remember the
first time that I entered it I as ushered
into a sort of bed chamber which like

[page]75|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00075|000076|000076[/page]
67
wise served as a drawing room. One of those ladies was in bed
but employed in preparations for the kitchen & was ac-
-tually [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] paring trouffles [insertion]truffles[/insertion]. [person]person_050|Vauquelin[/person] wished some imme-
-diately to be dressed for my breakfast & I had some difficul-
=ty to prevent Mademoiselle from rising even when I
was in the room. [deletion]n[/deletion] [insertion]N[/insertion]othing could be more extraordinary
than the simplicity of his conversation; he had
not the slightest tact & even in the presence of 
young ladies talked of subjects which since the paradisaical
times can never have been objects of common conversation. When
I was President of the Royal Society he sent me a long letter
in favour of a gentleman that he called his intimate
friend with various testimonies & memorials of his
merits. I had supposed that they must be scientific
what was my surprize when I found that it
was a french gentleman who had had [nonenglish]nonenglish_314|mauvaise[/nonenglish]
fortune but who was seeking for [nonenglish]nonenglish_315|bonne[/nonenglish] fortune
& [insertion]was a fortune hunter & anxious to be introduced to[/insertion] who was anxious to be employed by Madame
La veuve [person]person_1020|Coutts[/person] & that he had a handsome

[page]76|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00076|000077|000077[/page]
person, good legs & that his name was li[deletion]t[/deletion]ter
ally Jaccasse. – [deletion]N[/deletion] - I have had very slight con-
nexion with american philosophers. [person]person_021|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestley[/person]
wrote me a very flattering letter on the occasion
of receiving my Researches chemical & philosophi-
-cal on [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous oxyde[/chemical], in which he stated his
own conviction of the inaccuracies of the
french school & said that he was sure if
I would repeat their labours I should gain
new results & [deletion]g[/deletion] [insertion]establish[/insertion] opinions entirely different
from theirs. I had not any great ambition to work
at his request for tho I had the highest opi-
nion of his candour & love of truth I had
but a low idea of the spirit of his philo-
sophy or of the extent of his talents or
resources. [misc]misc_607|This letter I received in 1801.[/misc]
[person]person_193|D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Woodhouse[/person] professor of Chemistry at
[place]place_1073|Philadelphia[/place] brought me I think a letter of
introduction from him in 1803 He appeared

[page]77|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00077|000078|000078[/page]
to me a tolerable [underline]chemist[/underline] & an accurate observer
but with respect to manners they were so wild
& awkward that I sometimes doubted
whether he did not belong to the race of red
men rather than that of Europeans. He
seemed to consider every thing in relation to
some pecuniary idea of value. If he saw
a very handsome equipage driving thro the streets
he said to me "Prey Sir; how many dollars
a year m[deletion]ay[/deletion][insertion]ust[/insertion] that gentleman have." If he
saw at a party a young man well dressed
with a handsome waistcoat he said, How
many dollars do ye think Sir that gentle-
=man would take for that waistcoat" &
it was sometimes with difficulty even that
I prevented him for asking a lady the price
of some article of her dress. He went
to a sort of masquerade at [place]place_175|Vauxhall[/place]
where the company was not very select. The
next day he called me over to describe the wonders

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00078|000079|000079[/page]
he had seen, but was not altogether
pleased with the decorum & manners of
the great ladies for he took the nymphs
of [place]place_1249|Drury Lane [/place]& [place]place_1250|Covent Garden[/place] for prin-
-cesses & Duchesses, but what astonished him
most was the concert of [underline]sparrows[/underline] who
at 4 oClock in the morning began their chirpings
in the trees above [underline]the garden. He[/underline] thought
that they were all artificial & said I
guess Sir that the training of those singing
birds must cost a sight of dollars & they
sing more naturally than our virginian
nightingales - since that time I have [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]seen[/insertion]
several [deletion][unclear]introductions[/unclear][/deletion] Americans who were
travelling for the purpose of improving
themselves in different parts of Europe, 
but I have seen few amongst them
who possessed what one should call in [place]place_121|England[/place]

[page]79|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00079|000080|000080[/page]

the manners or feelings of gentlemen. In their 
education & their acquirements they put
me very much in mind of those young
men who have been brought up at mili -
-tarian or sectarian [underline]academies[/underline] & their
manners were like those of the second
-rate inhabitants of manufacturing 
towns. I do not think I ever met
with one who was a [underline]man[/underline] of taste
or who had even the tact which is ne-
-cessary to enable a man to enter
into refined society. I have perhaps
been unfortunate in my acquaintances
but they appeared to me to combine
most of the defects & few of the virtues
of the savage in social life. they squeezed
you, pinched you & trod on your [underline]feet[/underline] in
crowds but were angry if you took
the same liberties with them & seemed

[page]80|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00080|000081|000081[/page]
never disposed to offer the compliment of the
French man in reply to a person who begged
his pardon for treading on his toes. Vous
ne m'avez pas fait du mal Monsieur 
tout au contraire. The scientific taste 
in [place]place_878|America[/place] seems to me almost always con-
=nected with gross profit or common utility
In mineralogy & [misc]misc_612|docimastic[/misc] chemistry they have 
made some considerable progress & in prac-
-tical astronomy some slight advan[insertion]-ces[/insertion][deletion][unclear]ment[/unclear][/deletion]
but in the higher departments of the
profound & refined branches of Science they
have done little or nothing, even in natural
history they have gone very little way
tho their oportunities have been very great
This has probably arisen in some measure
from their having no national school & as
yet no great philosopher born in the American
states for [person]person_394|Franklin[/person] as well as [person]person_1017|Washington[/person]

[page]81|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00081|000082|000082[/page]
73
might both be considered as english in their
education & habits & since the period of their
independence they have had many [insertion]great[/insertion] objects more
likely to arrest the attention that those of [underline]Science[/underline]
yet I am told they have good collections
in Zoology & Ornithology at [place]place_1073|Philadelphia[/place] and 
New York & in these respects I believe may
almost rival the mother country. Indeed
[deletion]with respect[/deletion] [insertion]speaking[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] of [place]place_121|England[/place] I believe no country
can be placed lower than She is with res-
-pect to her collections in ancient Art or in 
modern Science. A few liberal minded & patriotic
men have done much by their private collections
& some particular institutions or colleges
by their private means have afforded resources
to scientific men but our national establish
ment. the British Museum is unworthy of a 
great people & is even inferior to many of 
those belonging to second rate states on the

[page]82|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00082|000083|000083[/page]
continent yet there have been considerable
Sums of money devoted to the objects
of this collection & it contains some choice
marbles & some interesting specimens in na-
=tural history & far more might have been
done with the sums voted for the purpose
by parliament had they been judiciously
applied. When first established the Trustees
were either great officers of state
owing their situation to their office or
some persons of science art & better assos-
-ciated with them & elected by the principal
Trustees. When the british Museum was
formed in consequence of the bequest of [person]person_1018|Sir[line]Hans Sloane[/person] President of the Royal Society
of his splendid collections to the country
the leading trustees of the elected classes were

[page]83|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00083|000084|000084[/page]
either distinguished members of the Royal
Society or highly accomplished noblemen and
gentlemen possessed [deletion]wit[/deletion] of refined Knowledge
in Art or profound knowledge in Science
The last scientific trustee elected was M[superscript]r[/superscript]-
[person]person_026|Henry Cavendish[/person] Lately the elections have been 
almost entirely made from branches of the 
aristocracy or gentlemen of some parliamentary
influence & tho’ fortunately for the country
men of taste have some times filled those
offices & repaid for the small honour
they received by leaving their magnificent
collections to the public yet such instan=
= ces have been very rare. The archbishops 
of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor & the Speaker
of the House of Commons are considered as the
really active members of the trust & over
=powered as those great offices must be
with the religious leg[deletion]al[/deletion][insertion]islative[/insertion] & [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]legislative[/insertion] affairs 

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00084|000085|000085[/page]
of the country it cannot be supposed
that they can have much leisure or much
oportunity to attend to the government
or the arrangement of the national collections.
All the officers who ought to be either
efficient librarians or curators of the
house used to be elected in turns by the
Archbishop of Canterbury & the Speaker
of the House of Commons for the late
Chancellor [person]person_1019|Lord Eldon[/person] always refused to
act as a trustee considering probably
with great propriety that he had other
duties more essential to his office to 
perform; it is not therefore to be wondered
at that amongst the Curators [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] assistant
librarians & sublibrarians there should be
many persons found taken from the inferior

=ficult to find personages who have exercised
their duties of finding & electing officers with
more discrimination than had been exercised by
the late primate or his colleague of the 
chair of the house of Commons but the task offered
to them was wholly unfit for their stations
& [insertion]the[/insertion] public, the museums & the scientific
glory of [place]place_121|England[/place] have suffered extremely

of the appointment of such great public characters as the

acting governors of the establishment. 
If men of the highest distinction as to 
scientific character had always occupied
the most exalted offices in the musæum 
either as curators of the collections or as 
zoologists, ornithologists, entomologists, 
minerologists, botanists, superintendents
of the ancient collections of sculpture
& painting, & if the salaries of such 
officers had been made respectable & 
their rank a gratifying or enviable one

from the other, the sculpture must be 
judged by men who have shown their
knowledge of taste with regard to this
branch of the fine arts. The collection
& arrangement of paintings must be
trusted either to artists themselves 
or refined judges of art. The Zoologist

As this is the earliest bird I have seen of the
kind in Europe I examined its caudal feathers
with particular attention. It had no pure
white feathers in the tail & therefore its
winter plumage does not in fact differ
from its summer plumage. As soon as
the birds are full grown there appear
10 or 12 feathers of which half are
white forming a semicircle in the tail
& which I believe are of the same
colour & appearance in both sexes

directly from the shores of [place]place_222|Africa[/place] to those of
Europe probably from [place]place_1217|Carthage[/place] to [place]place_155|Rome[/place]. It had
I think just made a long flight & its stomach
was comparatively empty, but with some ap-

later in its passage, later [deletion]th[/deletion] even than the [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc]
or the [misc]misc_418|Woodcock[/misc]. In 1828. In the drains about [place]place_216|Laybach[/place]
in [place]place_192|Illyria[/place] common [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] were seen in the middle of July.
The first double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] appeared the first week in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript]
when likewise [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] were seen, the first Jack
[misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc] did not appear till more than 3 weeks later
the 29 of Sep[superscript]r[/superscript]. I was informed at [place]place_1106|Copenhagen[/place] that
the [misc]misc_341|Jack Snipe[/misc] certainly breeds in Zeeland & I saw a
nest with its eggs said to be from the Island of Sandholme
opposite [place]place_1106|Copenhagen[/place]. & I have no doubt that this
bird & the [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc] sometimes make their nests
in the marshes of [place]place_1123|Holstein[/place] & Hannover. An excellent
sportsman & good observer informs me that in the great
royal decoy or marsh preserve near Hannover, He
has had ocular proofs of double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] being raised
from the nest there: but these birds require solitude
& perfect quiet, & as their food is peculiar, they demand
a great extent of marshy meadow. Their stomach is the thinnest

& rest both circumstances favourable to fat.
In wet open weather they are often obliged to make
long flights & their food is more distributed.
The [misc]misc_341|Jack Snipe[/misc] feeds upon smaller insects than
the [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc] small white larvæ such as are found
in [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] black bogs are its favourite food; but I
have generally found seeds in its stomach once hemp seeds
& always gavel. I know not where the [misc]misc_341|Jack Snipe[/misc]
breeds; but I suspect far North. I never saw their
nest or young ones in [place]place_324|Germany[/place] [place]place_897|France [/place][insertion][place]place_1027|Hungary[/place] [place]place_192|Illyria[/place][/insertion] or the British
Islands. The common [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc] breeds in great quantities
in the [deletion]great[/deletion] [insertion]extensive[/insertion] marshes of [place]place_1027|Hungary[/place] & [place]place_192|Illyria[/place]: but I do
not think the [misc]misc_341|Jack Snipe[/misc] breeds there for even
in [deletion]Aug[superscript]t[/superscript][/deletion] July & Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] with the first very dry weather
many [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] with ducks & teal come into the marshes

as if to divert the attention of the intruder, a few
[misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] always breed in the marshes of [underline][place]place_121|England[/place][/underline] &
[place]place_235|Scotland[/place] but a far greater number retire for 
this purpose to the Hebrides & [place]place_940|the Orkneys[/place]
In the hether surrounding a small lake in the Island of
Hoy in [place]place_940|the Orkneys[/place] I found in the month of August
of 1817 the nests of 10 or 12 couple of [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]. I was
grouseshooting & my dog continually pointed
[deletion]to young [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] which[/deletion] [insertion]them and[/insertion] as these were some
times three young ones & two old ones in
the nest [insertion]this[/insertion] had a most powerful scent, from
some accident of the season these [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]
were very late in being hatched for they
usually fly before the middle of July but
this year even as late as the 15 of August
there were many young [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] that had not 
yet their wing feathers. [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] are usually
fattest in frosty weather; which I believe is owing to this
that [deletion]they[/deletion] in such weather they haunt only warm springs
where worms are abundant & they do not willingly quit
these places: [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] so that they have plenty of nourishment

& Brittany the woods of [place]place_121|England[/place] particularly of the 
west & south contain allways a certain quantity
of [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] but these are far more in the moist
soil & warmer climate of [place]place_018|Ireland[/place], but in the woods
of [place]place_097|Italy[/place][superscript]2[/superscript] southern & [place]place_167|Greece[/place] near marshes they are far
more abundant & they extend in quantities over the
greek islands, [place]place_1083|Asia Minor[/place] & Northern [place]place_222|Africa[/place]
The [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc] is one of the most generally distri-
=buted birds belonging to Europe. It feeds upon almost
every kind of worm or larvæ & as I have said
before its stomach sometimes contains seeds &
rice, it prefers a country cold in the summer
to breed in; but wherever there is much [insertion]fluid[/insertion] water &
great morasses this bird is almost certain to
be found. Its nest is very inartificial, its eggs
large & the young ones soon become of an enormous
size being often before they can fly larger than
their parents Two young ones are usually the
number in a nest but I have seen three. The
old birds are exceedingly attached to their off-
spring & if any one approaches near the nest
they make a loud & drumming noise above the head.

[page]104|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00104|000105|000105[/page]
but fly from wood to wood reposing & feeding on their jour-
=rney. They prefer for their haunts woods near marshes
or morasses, they hide themselves under thick bushes in
the day & fly abroad to feed in the dusk of the evening
A laurel or a holly bush is a favourite place for
their [deletion]diurnal[/deletion] repose. The thick & varnished leaves of those
trees prevents the radiation of heat from the soil &
they are less affected by the refrigerating influence of
a clear sky so that they afford a warm seat for
the [misc]misc_418|Woodcock[/misc]. [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] usually begin to fly north
on the first approach of spring & their flights are gener-
ally longer & their rests fewer at this season than
in the autumn. In the autumn they are driven
from the north to the south by the want of
food & they stop [insertion]stop[/insertion] wherever they can find food. In
the spring, there is the influence of another power-
=ful instinct added to this: the sexual feeling. They
migrate in pairs & pass as speedily as possible to the
place where they are likely to find food & to raise
their young & of which the old birds have already
had the experience of former years [deletion]few[/deletion] [insertion]scarcely any[/insertion] [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc]
winter in any part of [place]place_324|Germany[/place]. In France there are a few
found particularly in the southern provinces & in [place]place_874|Normandy[/place]

[Ink symbols doodled in margin before first few lines] their instincts altered by the accident of their being born
in [place]place_121|England[/place]; & being in a place well supplied with food
it is not improbable that they raised likewise young
ones & that the habit of staying has become hereditary
There can be no doubt that [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] are very constant
to their local attachments; [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] that have been
preserved in a particular wood for a winter always return
to it if possible the next season. Many [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] breed
in [place]place_188|Norway[/place] & [place]place_246|Sweden[/place] in the great extensive & moist
pine woods filled with bogs & morasses which cover
these wild countries but probably a still greater
number breed [deletion]still[/deletion] farther north in [place]place_876|Lapland[/place] Finland
[place]place_295|Russia[/place] & [place]place_990|Siberia[/place]. It is I believe a fable that they [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
raise their young habitually in the high alpine or
mountainous countries of the central or southern
parts of Europe. These countries indeed in summer are
very better fitted for their feeding, they cannot bore
where it is either dry or frosty & the glaciers or the
[deletion]dry[/deletion] [insertion]arid[/insertion] sand [insertion]or rock[/insertion] are equally unfitted for their haunts. They
leave the north with the first frosts & travel
slowly south till they come to their accustomed
[deletion]haunts[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]res[/deletion] winter quarters[/insertion] they do not usually make a quick voyage

I shall say a few words on the congeners of this bird [insertion]the solitary [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc][/insertion]
& on the three varieties so much better known in Europe
The [misc]misc_418|Woodcock[/misc] feeds indiscriminately upon earthworms
small beetles & various kinds of larvæ & its stomach
sometimes contains seeds which I suspect have been
taken up in boring amongst the excrements of cattle
yet the stomach of this bird has something of the
gizzard character tho not so much as that of the land
=rail which I have found half filled with seeds of
grasses & even containing corn mixed with maybugs
earthworms, grasshoppers and caterpillars. The [misc]misc_418|Woodcock[/misc]
I believe breeds habitually only in high northern latitudes
yet there are woods in [place]place_121|England[/place] particularly one
in [place]place_161|Sussex[/place] near the borders of [place]place_027|Hampshire[/place] in which
one or two couple of these birds it is said may always
be found in summer; I suspect these [misc]misc_418|woodcocks[/misc] are [deletion]the[/deletion]
[insertion]from the[/insertion] offspring of birds which had paired for their passage
