Fontainbleau Dec. 29[superscript]th[/superscript]-. 1813 –
[Horizontal rule]
The mists disperse and where a sullen cloud.
Hung on the mountains verge the Sun bursts forth.
In all its majesty of purple light,
It is a winters evening and the year
Is fast departing; yet the hues of heaven
Are bright as in the summers warmest months,
It is the season of the sleep of things
But nature in her sleep is lovely still.
The trees display no green, no forms of life,
And yet a magic foliage cloaths them round,
The purest crystals of pellucid ice
All purple in the sun-set
Amidst the wood
Fantastically rise the towering cliffs,
That in another season had been white;
But now contrasted with the brilliant ice
Shine in aerial tints of purest blue.
The varied outline has a thousand charms;
Here rises high a venerable wood
Where oaks are seen with massy ice girt round
And birches pendant with their glittering arms,
And graceful beeches clinging to the soil:
These massy forms exist of rocks alone.
Rising as if the work of human art.
The pride of some great paladin of other days
In awful ruins
Nearer I behold
The palace of a race of mighty kings,
But now another tenants. On those walls
Where erst the silver lily spread her leaves.
The graceful symbol of a brilliant court,
The golden eagle shines, the bird of prey.
Emblem of rapine and of lawless power.
Such is the fitful change of human things:
An empire rises like a cloud in heaven
Red in the morning sun, spreading its tints
Of golden hue along the feverish sky
And filling the horizon. Soon its tints
Are darkened, & it brings the thunder storm,
Lightening, and hail, and desolation comes;
But in destroying it dissolves & falls,
Never to rise.

[Horizontal rule]
With joy I view thee bathed in purple light
Whilst all around is dark, With joy I see
Thee rising from thy sea of patchy clouds
Into the middle heaven.
As if a temple to th'eternal rais'd
By all the earth; framed of the pillar'd rock
And canopied with everlasting snow.
That lovely river rolling at my feet
Its bright green waves, & winding midst the rocks
Brown in their winters foliage, gain'd from thee 
Its flood of waters; and through a devious [insertion]course[/insertion] maze
Though it has lav'd the fertile plains, & wash'd
The cities walls, and mingled with the streams
Of lowland origin, yet still preserves
Its native character of mountain strength,
Its colour, and its motion. Such are those
Amongst the generations of mankind,
To whom the stream of thought descends from heaven
With all the force of reason, and the power
Of sacred genius. Through the world they pass
Still uncorrupted; and on what they take
From social life; bestow a character
Of dignity: Greater they become,
But never loose their native purity.

[Horizontal rule]
The air is soft as in the month of June.
In northern climes, a balmy zephyr blows,
And nothing speaks of winters harshest month,
Save that the trees are leafless; and yon Alps
Not as in summer merely capp'd by snow,
But deep encased, and girt around by ice.
Upon the mountains crowded round thy banks,
O lovely Rhone; no ice, no snows are seen;
But lively tints and varied, such as might
Bespeak autumnal days. The oak that long
Has kept its faded foliage cloaths their base
The bracken to their sides a richer tint
Of chesnut gives, And the green herbage cloathes
Their summits, bath’d in dew; save where the cliff
Uplifts its marble crest of hue diverse
And varied outline; grey with moss, or blue
In native colouring, or changed by time
And rusted by the active elements:
More lovely in decay, assuming forms
Of broken columns, & of mould'ring towers.
Thy nearest banks, O lovely river, glow
With the bright willow, round whose crimson bud
The water fly expands her glittering wings:
Thy upper slopes the graceful myrtle skirts,
Green as in spring time; and the primrose lurks
Beneath its odorous leaves. The fruitful vine

Darkens thy champain; and on many a hill
The villages on sober colours rise.
The castles tow'ring walls, & all the tints
Which human art bestows upon the scene.
Are chaste as if the master hand of Claude
Had traced upon the canvass their design.
From the deep gullies bosom’d in thy rocks
Descends in foam & thunder, many a stream
Without a name: but one is far remov’d,
Vauclause [insertion]Sorga[/insertion]: beside whose crystal waters sung
The bard of Provence.

Thy hues are green as is the vernal tint
Of those fair meads where Isis rolls along
Her silver floods; And not amongst the snows,
Nor on the hoary mountains ruffed crest
Is thy abode; but on the gentle hill,
Amongst the rocks, and by the rivers sides
Rises thy graceful & majestic form;
Companion of the olive, & the vine,
And that Hesperian tree whose golden fruit
Demands the Zephyr warmed by southern suns.
In winter thou art verdant as in spring,
Unchangeable in beauty; & thy reign
Extends from Calpe to the Bosphorus.
Beneath thy shade the northern african
Seeks shelter from the sunshine, & the greek
In Serapis vales, forms from thy slender leaves
A shepherds coronet.
Fanes of the Gods
Of Egypt, & of Greece, majestic rise
Amidst thy shades: And to the memory,
O lovely tree, thy resting places bring
All that is noble in our history;

But now a mist obscures the ambient air;

Thy brow. At first [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]so[/insertion] white so bright so fierce
The snows seem dark beneath its crisped fringe
And now it spreads a thicker canopy,
And rapidly descends & fill thy glens,
And covers all thy rocks. Its tints are changed
Its fleecy whiteness gone. The sun beams fade
And loose their glory in its sullen gloom
Portentous of the storm. And now the rain
Descends in floods the angry lightning gleams,
The thunder roars. The tempest howls along
Thy echoing cliffs & the vexed main
Mingles her white foam with the troubled floods
The torrents of the mountain roll along.

I see the rifted rocks above thy stream
O Sorgne and as I trace its silver wave along
A scene of pastoral beauty glads my eye,
Well suited to a pastoral poets song
Meads that have gain'd their freshness from thy wave
And fed upon thy dews; whitened with flocks;
And gentle slopes where midst the broken rocks
The vines spread forth their branches to the sun,
As if they gain'd their nurture from his beams.
And in the richer soil the olive turns
Its glittering foliage from the northern blast
Along the hills the stately villa peers
Embosomed deep in cypress - On the plain
The cottages are spread and many a row
Of trees in formal trim the pruners art
Declare Fitted for use to bear the richest fruits
Pomona culls, or for the verdant food 
Of that fair insect daughter of the spring
Whose industry supplies the Cimbrian looms.

And airy battlements as if in sport

And now I hear the thund'ring cataract.
It is thy lofty spring O wondrous stream
Born of the mountain snows thy course is made
In darkness and in silence deeply hid
Within thy channel of the marble rock
And all at once those risest unto light

Growing amidst thy waters mingling hues.
Of Emerald with thy transparent blue
I wonder not the poet loved thy wave

[underline]Dialogue 5 The Chemical[/underline]
[underline][deletion]The[/deletion] Philosopher [deletion]The effects of Time[/deletion][/underline].
[underline][deletion]The character of the Chemist[/deletion][/underline] –
[Horizontal rule]
I had been made religious by the conversations
of Ambrosio in Italy. My faith was strengthened
or exalted by the opinions of the unknown
For when I had not merely that veneration
awakened by exalted talents but a strong affection
founded upon the essential benefit of the preser-
vation of my life owing to him I ventured [deletion]to ask[/deletion]
[insertion]the evening after our visit to the cave of Adelsberg to ask him[/insertion]
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] some questions relating to his history & adventures
He said to attempt to give you any ideas of the 
formation of my character would lead me into the
history of my youth which almost approaches
a tale of romance. The source of the little infor=

mation & intelligence I possess I must refer to a restless ac-
tivity of spirit a love of glory which even belonged
to my infancy, & a sensibility easily excited & not
easily conquered.
My parentage was humble yet I can believe a traditional
history of my paternal grandmother that the origin or our
family was from an old noble norman stock. I formed
[deletion]the believe[/deletion] [insertion]this belief[/insertion] upon certain feelings which I can only refer to an
hereditary source a pride [deletion]attached[/deletion] [insertion]of decorum a tact[/insertion] & a refinement
even in [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] early infancy[/deletion] [insertion]boyhood[/insertion] & which are contradictory to 
the idea of my origin from a race of peasants.
Accident opened to me in early youth a philosophical
career which I pursued with success. In manhood for-
tune smiled upon me & made me independant. [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]-
rially became a philosopher & pursued my travels
with the object of instructing myself & of benefiting 
mankind. I have seen most parts of Europe & conver[insertion]s[/insertion]ed
I believe with all the illustrious men of science
belonging to there. My life has not been unlike that

of the ancient greek sages. - I have added some little to
the stock of human Knowledge & I have endeavoured
to add something to the quantity of human happin
=ess. In my early life I was a sceptic I have infor
-med you how I became a believer & I constantly
bless the supreme Intelligence for the favour of some
gleams of divine light which have been vouchsafed
to me in this our state of darkness & doubt.
[underline]Milauths[/underline]. I am surprized that with your powers
you did not enter into a professional [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] either of
law or of politicks: you would have gained the
highest honors of distinction.
The [underline]Unknown[/underline]. To me there has never been a higher
source of honor or distinction than [deletion]those[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] connected
with advances in science. I have not possessed enough
of the eagle in my character to make a direct
flight to the loftiest altitudes in the social world.
& I certainly never endeavoured to reach those heights
by using the creeping powers of the reptile who in
ascending generally chooses the dirtiest path

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00042|000043|000043[/page]
because it is the easiest -
[underline][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/underline]. I have often wondered that men of fortune
& of rank do not apply themselves more to phi-
losophical pursuits: they affect a delightful & an enviable
road to distinction, one furnished upon the blessings
[deletion]confer[/deletion] of benefits conferred on our [underline]fellow[/underline] creatures.
[deletion]They It does not offer[/deletion] [insertion]they do not supply[/insertion] the same sources of temporary po-
=pularity [insertion]as successes in the senate or at the bar[/insertion] but the glory resulting from them
is permanent, & independant of vulgar taste or
caprice. In looking back to the history of the last
five reigns in England we find Boyles’ Cavendish's
& Howards who rendered those great names more
illustrious by their scientific honors but we may in 
vain search the aristocracy now for philosophers & there 
are very few persons who pursue science with
true dignity; it is followed more as connected
with objects of profit than those of fame & there 
are fifty persons who take out [deletion]a[/deletion] patent[insertion]s[/insertion] for [deletion]a[/deletion]
supposed inventions to one who makes a real

discovery.
[underline]Phil[/underline]. The information we have already
received from you proves to me that [underline]Chemistry[/underline]
has been your favourite pursuit. I am surprised
at this. The higher mathematics & pure physics
appear to me to offer much more noble objects
of contemplation & fields of discovery & practically
considered the results of the Chemist are
much more humble, belonging principally to
The Apothecaries shop or the Kitchin.
[unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] I feel disposed to join you in attacking
this favorite study of our friend: but merely
to provoke him to defend it I [deletion]should[/deletion] wish
our attack would induce him to defend
his science & that we might enjoy a little

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00044|000045|000045[/page]
of the sport of literary Gladiators, at least
in order to call forth his skill & awaken
his eloquence.
The Unknown, I have no objection. Let them
in a fair description, remember we fight
only with foils & the point of mine shall
be covered with velvet
-In your attack on Chemistry [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear], You
limited the use of it to the Apothecaries shop &

[underline]Pola. or Time[/underline]
During our stay in Illyria, I made an
excursion by water with my unknown Preserver
now become my friend & Eubathes to Pola
in Istria. We entered the harbour
of Pola in a felucca when the sun was
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] setting & I knew no scene more
splendid than the Ampitheatre
seen from the sea in this light.
It appears not as a building in ruins
but like a new work & the reflection

Men of the 19 century.-
[underline][person]person_130|La Place[/person]. Berthollet & [person]person_141|Chaptal[/person][/underline] are described
Volta I saw at Milan in 1814. at that time advanced
in years I think nearly 70 & in bad health - His conversation
was not brilliant. His views rather limited but [deletion]not[/deletion]
marking great ingenuity. His manners were perfectly
simple. He had not the air of a courtier nor even of
a Man who had seen the world. - Indeed I [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] can
say generally of the Italian[deletion]s[/deletion] [deletion]that they their[/deletion] Scavans that [insertion]though[/insertion]
[deletion]had not at all[/deletion] [insertion]none of them had[/insertion] [deletion]an air noble [unclear]xx[/unclear] they appeared[/deletion] much dignity or grace
of manner yet they were all free from affectation.
In [person]person_198|Piazzi[/person] likewise an old Man then was more of [insertion]exterior[/insertion] philosophical
[deletion]scientific[/deletion] character [deletion]& of brilliancy[/deletion] than in Volta &
He discussed subjects of [deletion]philosophy[/deletion] [insertion]Science[/insertion] with more brilliancy
& address & with a little of the tone of a Master -

There never was a Man of more amiable benevolent
character than Morichini & His principal discovery 
shews an acuteness & originality not usual now in his 
countrymen.
To go back to France. Gay Lussac was quick
lively [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] ingenious & profound with great
activity of mind & great facility of manipulation
I would place him at the head of the living
chemists of France. It is true He has worked
with Then[insertion]a[/insertion]rd & they have formed for themselves
as it were one reputation. [deletion]but[/deletion] Gay Lussac however
is the superior Man. but I I have heard Thenard
much admired as an eloquent lecturer
Madame Gay Lussac in 1820 was a lively pleasing
woman, a little passed the age of coquettry
if a French woman can be ever said to be passed
that age. Madame Thenard was a charming little
brune with a most graceful figure & a countenance
full of character. She was amiable & I believe
extremely “sage”.

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00050|000051|000051[/page]
[underline]Arago[/underline] like a Spaniard in Countenance had a little
of the reserve & dignity of manner belonging to that 
nation. He was I believe from Rompilieu or the neighborhood
of [underline]the[/underline] pyr[deletion]y[/deletion]enees. He appeared to me candid in judgement
& accurate as an observer & experimenter. He was 
almost constantly in [underline]discussion[/underline] with Biot upon some
points of Scontested discovery & I felt always disposed
to think him in the right. He seemed to me to 
have so much more steadiness of character. Biot
was mobile active ingenious & laborious; but had
a restlessness not free from [insertion]obvious[/insertion] vanity Madame Arago
was a handsome Woman & very agreable [insertion]without pretensions[/insertion] [deletion] & Madame[/deletion]
[deletion]Biot was lively & agreeable[/deletion]. – I cannot say of 
Madame Biot that she was without pretensions but 
was lively ready & various in her conversational
powers -
[person]person_029|Beddoes[/person] was reserved in manner & almost shy; but his
countenance was very agreable. He [underline]was cold[/underline] in conversation
& apparently much occupied with his own peculiar views
& theories. Nothing was a stranger contrast to his apparant

coldness in discipline than his wild & active imagination
which was [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] as practical as Darwins. [underline]He[/underline] was little
enlightened by experiment & I may say little attentive to it
He had great talents & much reading; but had lived
too little amongst superior men. On his death bed He
wrote me a most affecting letter regretting his scientific
aberrations I remember one "expression" like one who has
scattered abroad the avena fatua of knowledge from
which neither branch nor blossom nor fruit has resulted.
I require the consolation of a friend". Beddoes had talents
which would have excelled him to the pinnacle of philosophical 
eminence if they had been applied with discretion.
De Humboldt was one of the most agreeable Men I
have ever known social, [deletion]conviviable[/deletion] modest, full of 
intelligence, with facilities of every kind, almost [underline]too fluent[/underline]
in conversation. His travels display his spirit of
enterprise His works are monuments of the variety
of his knowledge & resources. – 
Guyton de Morveau was very old when I made his
acquaintance between 70 & 80 & very feeble. Though He had been

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00052|000053|000053[/page]
a violent republican: He was Bonapartes Director of the 
Mint & a Baron of his Empire. His manner was mild
& conciliatory & it is a proof of the energy of his mind
that having promised his vote to a person as Cor. Member of
Le Institut. He kept his promise: & my election wanted only
his voice to have been unanimous. - Having never when
in France enquired into the intrigues connected with elections
or interested myself in them, I should not have known this
had not He himself told me so when I dined afterwards
at his house. - 
Prony appeared to me a good natured & placid man
not brilliant in conversation - simple & unaffected. –
[deletion]in manner[/deletion].
Cuvier had even in his address & manner the
character of a superior Man, much general [deletion]talent[/deletion] power & eloquence
in conversation & great variety of information on scientific as [insertion]well[/insertion]
[insertion]as[/insertion] popular subjects [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]. I should say of him
that He is the most distinguished man of [underline]talents[/underline]
I have known on the continent; but I [deletion]can hardly allow[/deletion] I doubt
[deletion]him to be[/deletion] [insertion]if He be entitled to the appellation of[/insertion] a Man of Genius. – Madam[superscript]lle[/superscript] Sophie D. -

his daughter in law was a charming conversible little
Woman with various talents & quick good nature & was more
agreable than if she had been a great beauty.
Banks was a good humoured and literal Man free &
various in conversational power, a tolerable botanist
& generally acquainted with Natural History, He had not
much reading; & no profound information - He was
always ready to promote the objects of Men of Science; but
He required to be regarded as a Patron & readily swallowed
gross flattery. - When He gave anecdotes of his voyages
He was very entertaining & unaffected - A Courtier in
character He was a warm friend of a good King. In his
relations to the Royal Society, He was too personal &
made his House & circle too like a court. – 
Cavendish was a great Man with extraordinary
singularities. His voice was squeaking His manner nervous
He was afraid of strangers & seemed when embarrassed
even to articulate with difficulty. He wore the costume
of our grandfathers. Was enormously rich but made no

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00054|000055|000055[/page]
use of his wealth. He gave me once some bits
of platinum for my experiments & came to see
my [deletion]exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/deletion] [insertion]results[/insertion] on the decomposition of the alkalies
& seemed to take an interest in them; but He encouraged
no intimacy with any one. [deletion]&[/deletion] He left 15000£ 
to Sir Charles Blagden by will, probably because they
had once been [deletion]intimate[/deletion] [insertion]great friends[/insertion] & had ceased to be so.- It 
is said that Sir C. Blagden had early
pecuniary obligations to Cavendish He [insertion]Cavendish[/insertion] lived [deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]the[/insertion] latterly the
life of a solitary, came to the Club dinner &
to the Royal Society: but received no body at
his Home. He was acute sagacious & profound.
& I think the most accomplished [deletion]& profound[/deletion] British
Philosopher of his time. – He was almost 80 when
He died. – Sir Charles Blagden was
gentleman like in manner, cold & selfish, well
informed & of agreable conversation, but possessed of
little belief & no genius. The information He had was

generally exact. –. John Dalton was a very singular
Man, a quaker by profession & practice He had none of
the manners or ways of the world. A tolerable
Mathematician He gained his livelihood I belive by
teaching the mathematics to young people. He pursued
science always with mathematical views. He seemed little
attentive to the labour of others except when they
countenanced or confirmed his own [deletion]views[/deletion] [insertion]ideas[/insertion]. It is difficult
to say how He gained his first notions of atoms; but
I strongly suspect [deletion]a work which I published[/deletion] [insertion]that [deletion]from[/deletion] Researches Chem & Philosophic published[/insertion] in180[deletion]0[/deletion][insertion]1[/insertion].
in which [deletion]it[/deletion] it is stated that Nitrate of Ammonia
became water & Nitrous oxide [insertion]& perhaps Cruickshanks discovery of Gas. Ox. C.[/insertion] gave him his first ideas.
He always referred to those [deletion]works[/deletion] [insertion]labours[/insertion] in his early papers; but 
afterwards seemed to have forgotten them He probably
had seen the works of the two Higgins. but I do
not think He was acquainted with the views of Richter.
In [deletion]B[/deletion] his lectures [insertion]at the Royal Institution[/insertion] He used to quote the Optics [insertion]of Newton[/insertion] saying that

The Sixth Dialogue. I think I shall
conclude with a vision of Eubathes, or
with the meeting of the five friends & a
vision of Ambrosio -
Which ever plan, I shall introduce the

[underline]Conclusion of the sixth Dialogue[/underline]
[deletion][underline]Eubathes[/underline][/deletion][insertion]Philaletes[/insertion]. Your history of the laws of the inevitable
destruction of material forms recals to my
memory our description at Adelsberg. The
changes of the material universe are in
harmony with those [deletion]of[/deletion] which belong to the
human body & which you suppose to be the
frame or machinery of the sentient principle.
May we not venture to inquire that the visible
& tangible world with which we are acquainted
by our sensations bear the same relation to the
divine & infinite intelligence that our organs
bear to our mind, with the only difference
that in the changes of the divine system
there is no decay, there being in the [deletion]system[/deletion] order
[insertion]of things[/insertion] a perfect unity & all the powers springing
from one will & being [deletion]on[/deletion] a consequence of that

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00058|000059|000059[/page]
will are perfectly & unalterably balanced. Newton
seemed to apprehend that in the laws of the
planetary motions there was a principle which
would ultimately be the cause of the destruction
of the system, La Place by pursuing & refining
the principles of our great Philosopher has proved
that what appeared sources of dis[deletion]c[/deletion]ord[insertion]er[/insertion] are in
fact the perfecting machinery of the system; &
that the principle of conservation is as eternal
as that of motion.
[underline]The Unknown[/underline]. I dare not offer any speculations
on this grand & awful subject. We can hardly
comprehend the cause of a simple atmospheric
phaenomenon such as the fall of a heavy body
from a Meteor. We cannot even embrace in
one view the millionth part of the objects
surrounding us & yet we have the presumption
to reason upon the infinite universe &

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00059|000060|000060[/page]
49
the eternal mind by which it was created & governed.
On these subjects, I have no confidence in reason, I trust
only to faith & as far as we ought to enquire
we have no other guide but revelation. – 
[underline]Philalithes[/underline]. I agree with you that whenever we
attempt metaphysical speculations we must begin
with a foundation of faith - that key [deletion]light by[/deletion] sure from
revelation that God is [deletion]ever[/deletion] omniscient & omnipotent
it appears to me no improper use of our faculties
to trace even in the material universe the acts
of his power & the results of his wisdom & to draw
parallels from the infinite to the finite mind. Remember
we are taught that “Man was created in the image
of God. " – & I think it cannot be doubted that in
the progress of society man has been made [insertion]a[/insertion] great sustain
-ment by his energies & labours for improving the
moral universe; Compare the Greeks & Romans with the
Assyrians & Babylonians & the ancient Greeks & Romans with 
the nations of modern Christendom & it cannot I think

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00060|000061|000061[/page]
be questioned that there has been a great superiority
in the later nations & that their improvements have
been subservient to the more exalted state of intellectual
& religious existence. If this little globe has been so
modified by its most powerful & active inhabitants I can-
-not help thinking that in other systems beings of a
superior nature under the influence of the divine
will may act higher parts. We know from the
sacred writings that there are intelligences of a
higher nature than man & I cannot help some-
-times referring [insertion]to[/insertion] my vision in the Coloseum & in sup-
-posing some acts of power by these Ginis & Seraphs
similar to those which I have imagined in the higher
planetary systems. There is [deletion]great[/deletion] [insertion]much[/insertion] reason to [deletion]believe[/deletion] [insertion]suppose[/insertion]
from astronomical observations that great changes
take place in the system of the fixed stars. Sir
William Herschel indeed seems to have believed that
he saw [deletion]a[/deletion] nebulous or luminous matter in the
progress of forming suns & there are some astronomers
who believe that stars have been extinct but it is more

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00061|000062|000062[/page]
53
probable that they have disappeared from peculiar
motions. It is perhaps rather a poetical than a
philosophical idea yet I cannot help forming the
opinion that Genii or seraphic intelligences may in
-habit these systems & may be the ministers of the
eternal mind in producing changes in them similar
to those which have taken place on the earth.
Time is almost a human word & change entirely a
human idea. In the system of nature we should
rather say progress than change. The sun appears
to sink in the ocean in darkness but it rises in another
hemisphere. The suns of a city fall but they are
often used to [deletion]regenerate[/deletion] [insertion]form[/insertion] most magnificent structures
as at Rome, but even when they are destroyed so as
to form only dust nature asserts her empire over
them & the vegetable world rises in constant youth
& in a period of annual [unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] by the labours of
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] man providing food vitality & beauty upon the
wrecks of monuments which were once raised for
purposes of glory but which are now applied to 
objects of utility.

Newton had expressed his views [insertion]almost[/insertion] as well as he could express
them himself. Whatever came into his mind [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
from any source. He seemed always to consider as his own
property. He was a very disinterested man, seemed
to have no ambition beyond that of being thought
a great Philosopher. He was a very coarse 
Experimenter & almost always found the results
He required. Trusting to his head rather than to
his hand. - Memory & observation were subordinate
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] qualities in his mind. He followed with
ardour analogies & inductions & however his claims
to originality may admit of question. I have no
doubt that He was [insertion]one of[/insertion] the most original philosophers of
his time & one of the most ingenious. – 
Wollaston may be compared to Dalton for originality of view
& was far his superior in accuracy. He was an admirable
manipulator, steady cautious & sure. His judgement was

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00068|000069|000069[/page]
cool.- His views sagacious - His inductions made
with care slowly formed & seldom renounced. He had 
much of the same spirit of philosophy as Cavendish. – 
[insertion]But unlike Cavendish[/insertion] He applied Science to purposes of profit & for
many years sold manufactured platinum. He died
very rich. Some accidental annoyances in the
medical profession made him I think jealous
& reserved in the earlier part of his life: but latterly
He [unclear]xx[/unclear] become far more agreable & confiding &
was a warm & kind friend & a pleasant social
companion. – 
Hatchett was a lively & agreable Man without
much firmness of character, good natured conversible
& with great variety of information. In early life He
had been an active & accurate chemist, but I do
not think had any love of the Science except on account
of the distinction it procured him. He however shewed

[page]69|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00069|000070|000070[/page]

his love for chemists by marrying his daughter to M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Brande. [deletion]the Son of a German Apothecary[/deletion].She was a
charming little woman. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Brande was not I think
worthy of her. being a very inferior person. & He followed
Chemistry always as [insertion][deletion]a German[/deletion] as a metier[/insertion][deletion]an Apothecary might be expected[/deletion]
[deletion]to do[/deletion] for small distinctions & as much profit as He
could obtain. Berzelius has put him in the same
line with M[superscript]r[/superscript] Accum This I think unfair Accum
was both a cheat & a quack. Brande had the
manner of a Gentleman & was I believe perfectly
honorable in conduct: but a coxcomb in dress &
manner. & as a journalist illiberal or perhaps rather
[underline]careless[/underline] [insertion]careless[/insertion] He had so little tact that He was not
aware of the effects of certain criticisms & allowed
them to be inserted from open enemies of the Authors
attached.
Berzelius was the worthy countryman of Scheele
& certainly one of the great Chemists of the age
Indefatigable in labour, accurate in manipulation

[page]70|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00070|000071|000071[/page]
no one has worked with more profit. His manner
was not distinguished, [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] his appearance rather
coarse & his conversation was limited much
to his own subjects. [underline]Orsted[/underline] is chiefly
distinguished by his discovery of Electromagnetism
He was a man of simple manners & of no pretensions
& not of extensive resources; but ingenious & a little
of a German metaphysician. Gauss appeared to me
a very superior man. I met him at the house
of Olbers at Bremen a delightful old philosopher
with a passion for Astronomy only surpassed in ardour,
by that possessed by [underline]Schumacher[/underline]. I was
equally pleased with the manners - with the
liberality & social gaiety of these three
celebrated men with whom I spent one of 
the most agreeable days belonging to the later
period of my life. –

I must not pass by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Young called Phenomenon Young
at Cambridge - a Man of universal erudition
& almost universal accomplishments. Had he
limited himself to any one department of knowledge
He must have been first in that department. 
But as a Mathematician & [deletion][unclear]xx xxx[/unclear][/deletion] scholar 
a Hieroglyphist He was eminent & He knew so
much that it is difficult to say what He did
not know. He was a most admirable & good tempered
Man. a little [insertion]too[/insertion] fond [insertion]perhaps of the[/insertion] [deletion]of running after the[/deletion] society of
persons of rank for a true philosopher. -
Pepys was a cutler in the poultry & one of the best
& warmest hearted Men I ever knew with an ardent
zeal for science & great [deletion]candour[/deletion] [insertion]fervour[/insertion] in pursuit [insertion]of scientific objects[/insertion] [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] warmth
of character. Men who did not know him well were
apt to be annoyed by his citizen like manners, those
with whom he was intimate could not fail of
admiring & loving him. Allen was a benevolent

quaker always employed upon good & useful plans
& I believe one [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] of the most conscientious as well 
[deletion]amiable as well[/deletion] one of the most amiable of Men. – 
He [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] & Pepys made some good & accurate
chemical experiments together. – Buckland was
a lively & clever Oxonian who pursued geology
with great ardour & success popular as a
lecturer & a writer & thoroughly amiable Man.

since 1821 to the Royal Society. I particu-
-larly wish to mention those of Herschel
Jenner. Baylie & Marcet. I shall give
a few gleanings more from the scientific
& literary academics. Ampere was a
mathematician of various resources & I
think might rather be called excentric
than original. He was as it were always
mounted upon a hobby horse of a mon-
-strous character pursuing the most re-
=mote & distant analogies. His hobby
horse was sometimes like that of a child
made of heavy wood, at other times it resembled
[deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]loose[/insertion] chasses used in the Laudes & at other
times it was like a hyppogrif in a [deletion]magie[/deletion]
pantomime [insertion]de magie[/insertion]. He had a sort of faith in
animal magnetism & has published
some refined & ingenious memoirs to prove

[page]74|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00074|000075|000075[/page]
the identity of electricity & magnetism
but even in these views he is rather as I
said before excentric than original. He
has always appeared to me to possess a
very disc[deletion]o[/deletion]ursive imagination & but little
accuracy of [deletion]exp[/deletion] observation [insertion]or[/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] acuteness
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]of[/insertion] research. -
Vauquelin was in the decline of life when I
first saw him in 1813, a man who gave
one the idea of the french chemists of
another age belonging almost [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] more to
the pharmaceutical laboratory than to the
philosophical and yet he lived in the Jardin
du Roi. Nothing could be more singular than his man-
ners, his life & his menage. Two old maiden ladies The
Mademoiselles Fourcroy sisters of the professor of
that name kept his house. I remember the
first time that I entered it I as ushered
into a sort of bed chamber which like

[page]75|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00075|000076|000076[/page]
67
wise served as a drawing room. One of those ladies was in bed
but employed in preparations for the kitchen & was ac-
-tually [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] paring trouffles [insertion]truffles[/insertion]. Vauquelin wished some imme-
-diately to be dressed for my breakfast & I had some difficul-
=ty to prevent Mademoiselle from rising even when I
was in the room. [deletion]n[/deletion] [insertion]N[/insertion]othing could be more extraordinary
than the simplicity of his conversation; he had
not the slightest tact & even in the presence of 
young ladies talked of subjects which since the paradisaical
times can never have been objects of common conversation. When
I was President of the Royal Society he sent me a long letter
in favour of a gentleman that he called his intimate
friend with various testimonies & memorials of his
merits. I had supposed that they must be scientific
what was my surprize when I found that it
was a french gentleman who had had mauvaise
fortune but who was seeking for bonne fortune
& [insertion]was a fortune hunter & anxious to be introduced to[/insertion] who was anxious to be employed by Madame
La veuve Coutts & that he had a handsome

[page]76|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00076|000077|000077[/page]
person, good legs & that his name was li[deletion]t[/deletion]ter
ally Jaccasse. – [deletion]N[/deletion] - I have had very slight con-
nexion with american philosophers. D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestley
wrote me a very flattering letter on the occasion
of receiving my Researches chemical & philosophi-
-cal on nitrous oxyde, in which he stated his
own conviction of the inaccuracies of the
french school & said that he was sure if
I would repeat their labours I should gain
new results & [deletion]g[/deletion] [insertion]establish[/insertion] opinions entirely different
from theirs. I had not any great ambition to work
at his request for tho I had the highest opi-
nion of his candour & love of truth I had
but a low idea of the spirit of his philo-
sophy or of the extent of his talents or
resources. This letter I received in 1801.
D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Woodhouse professor of Chemistry at
Philadelphia brought me I think a letter of
introduction from him in 1803 He appeared

[page]77|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00077|000078|000078[/page]
to me a tolerable [underline]chemist[/underline] & an accurate observer
but with respect to manners they were so wild
& awkward that I sometimes doubted
whether he did not belong to the race of red
men rather than that of Europeans. He
seemed to consider every thing in relation to
some pecuniary idea of value. If he saw
a very handsome equipage driving thro the streets
he said to me "Prey Sir; how many dollars
a year m[deletion]ay[/deletion][insertion]ust[/insertion] that gentleman have." If he
saw at a party a young man well dressed
with a handsome waistcoat he said, How
many dollars do ye think Sir that gentle-
=man would take for that waistcoat" &
it was sometimes with difficulty even that
I prevented him for asking a lady the price
of some article of her dress. He went
to a sort of masquerade at Vauxhall
where the company was not very select. The
next day he called me over to describe the wonders

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00078|000079|000079[/page]
he had seen, but was not altogether
pleased with the decorum & manners of
the great ladies for he took the nymphs
of Drury Lane & Covent Garden for prin-
-cesses & Duchesses, but what astonished him
most was the concert of [underline]sparrows[/underline] who
at 4 oClock in the morning began their chirpings
in the trees above [underline]the garden. He[/underline] thought
that they were all artificial & said I
guess Sir that the training of those singing
birds must cost a sight of dollars & they
sing more naturally than our virginian
nightingales - since that time I have [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]seen[/insertion]
several [deletion][unclear]introductions[/unclear][/deletion] Americans who were
travelling for the purpose of improving
themselves in different parts of Europe, 
but I have seen few amongst them
who possessed what one should call in England

[page]79|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00079|000080|000080[/page]

the manners or feelings of gentlemen. In their 
education & their acquirements they put
me very much in mind of those young
men who have been brought up at mili -
-tarian or sectarian [underline]academies[/underline] & their
manners were like those of the second
-rate inhabitants of manufacturing 
towns. I do not think I ever met
with one who was a [underline]man[/underline] of taste
or who had even the tact which is ne-
-cessary to enable a man to enter
into refined society. I have perhaps
been unfortunate in my acquaintances
but they appeared to me to combine
most of the defects & few of the virtues
of the savage in social life. they squeezed
you, pinched you & trod on your [underline]feet[/underline] in
crowds but were angry if you took
the same liberties with them & seemed

[page]80|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00080|000081|000081[/page]
never disposed to offer the compliment of the
French man in reply to a person who begged
his pardon for treading on his toes. Vous
ne m'avez pas fait du mal Monsieur 
tout au contraire. The scientific taste 
in America seems to me almost always con-
=nected with gross profit or common utility
In mineralogy & docimastic chemistry they have 
made some considerable progress & in prac-
-tical astronomy some slight advan[insertion]-ces[/insertion][deletion][unclear]ment[/unclear][/deletion]
but in the higher departments of the
profound & refined branches of Science they
have done little or nothing, even in natural
history they have gone very little way
tho their oportunities have been very great
This has probably arisen in some measure
from their having no national school & as
yet no great philosopher born in the American
states for Franklin as well as Washington

might both be considered as english in their
education & habits & since the period of their
independence they have had many [insertion]great[/insertion] objects more
likely to arrest the attention that those of [underline]Science[/underline]
yet I am told they have good collections
in Zoology & Ornithology at Philadelphia and 
New York & in these respects I believe may
almost rival the mother country. Indeed
[deletion]with respect[/deletion] [insertion]speaking[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] of England I believe no country
can be placed lower than She is with res-
-pect to her collections in ancient Art or in 
modern Science. A few liberal minded & patriotic
men have done much by their private collections
& some particular institutions or colleges
by their private means have afforded resources
to scientific men but our national establish
ment. the British Museum is unworthy of a 
great people & is even inferior to many of 
those belonging to second rate states on the

[page]82|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00082|000083|000083[/page]
continent yet there have been considerable
Sums of money devoted to the objects
of this collection & it contains some choice
marbles & some interesting specimens in na-
=tural history & far more might have been
done with the sums voted for the purpose
by parliament had they been judiciously
applied. When first established the Trustees
were either great officers of state
owing their situation to their office or
some persons of science art & better assos-
-ciated with them & elected by the principal
Trustees. When the british Museum was
formed in consequence of the bequest of Sir
Hans Sloane President of the Royal Society
of his splendid collections to the country
the leading trustees of the elected classes were

[page]83|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00083|000084|000084[/page]
either distinguished members of the Royal
Society or highly accomplished noblemen and
gentlemen possessed [deletion]wit[/deletion] of refined Knowledge
in Art or profound knowledge in Science
The last scientific trustee elected was M[superscript]r[/superscript]-
Henry Cavendish Lately the elections have been 
almost entirely made from branches of the 
aristocracy or gentlemen of some parliamentary
influence & tho’ fortunately for the country
men of taste have some times filled those
offices & repaid for the small honour
they received by leaving their magnificent
collections to the public yet such instan=
= ces have been very rare. The archbishops 
of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor & the Speaker
of the House of Commons are considered as the
really active members of the trust & over
=powered as those great offices must be
with the religious leg[deletion]al[/deletion][insertion]islative[/insertion] & [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]legislative[/insertion] affairs 

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00084|000085|000085[/page]
of the country it cannot be supposed
that they can have much leisure or much
oportunity to attend to the government
or the arrangement of the national collections.
All the officers who ought to be either
efficient librarians or curators of the
house used to be elected in turns by the
Archbishop of Canterbury & the Speaker
of the House of Commons for the late
Chancellor Lord Eldon always refused to
act as a trustee considering probably
with great propriety that he had other
duties more essential to his office to 
perform; it is not therefore to be wondered
at that amongst the Curators [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] assistant
librarians & sublibrarians there should be
many persons found taken from the inferior

=ficult to find personages who have exercised
their duties of finding & electing officers with
more discrimination than had been exercised by
the late primate or his colleague of the 
chair of the house of Commons but the task offered
to them was wholly unfit for their stations
& [insertion]the[/insertion] public, the museums & the scientific
glory of England have suffered extremely
from this injudicious foundation of the

If men of the highest distinction as to 
scientific character had always occupied
the most exalted offices in the musæum 
either as curators of the collections or as 
zoologists, ornithologists, entomologists, 
minerologists, botanists, superintendents
of the ancient collections of sculpture
& painting, & if the salaries of such 
officers had been made respectable & 
their rank a gratifying or enviable one

from the other, the sculpture must be 
judged by men who have shown their
knowledge of taste with regard to this
branch of the fine arts. The collection
& arrangement of paintings must be
trusted either to artists themselves 
or refined judges of art. The Zoologist
should have his department entirely to him-
-self, & the mineralogist would not find
even the present treasures of the British
Museum too extensive for much active la-
=bour, philosophical research & even use-
=ful discovery in the variety of their arrange-
=ments & bearings & a good geologist by
connecting the history of the specimens
of inorganic nature with those of 
living animals might open to the

[page]90|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00090|000091|000091[/page]
world a number of curious and very
extraordinary truths. Then the libraries
should be kept perfectly distinct
from the other part of the museum
& there should be at least four en-
lightened & literary men of celebrity
to take charge of these treasures now
made so magnificent by the royal
gift as to lay them open in the most
profitable and the most agreable way
to the public.-
It appears to me that the present is
the best moment for attempting a
radical & fundamental change
in every thing belonging to this

As this is the earliest bird I have seen of the
kind in Europe I examined its caudal feathers
with particular attention. It had no pure
white feathers in the tail & therefore its
winter plumage does not in fact differ
from its summer plumage. As soon as
the birds are full grown there appear
10 or 12 feathers of which half are
white forming a semicircle in the tail
& which I believe are of the same

[deletion]cor[/deletion] Salmonia respecting the double Snipe
[Short horizontal rule]
[insertion]Rome[/insertion] This Day [insertion]Wednesday[/insertion] March 11[superscript]th[/superscript] I got in the market [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] the first
double snipe which I think it is probable came
directly from the shores of Africa to those of
Europe probably from Carthage to Rome. It had
I think just made a long flight & its stomach
was comparatively empty, but with some ap-
-pearance of the remains of hexapod larvae

[page]100|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00100|000101|000101[/page]
later in its passage, later [deletion]th[/deletion] even than the double snipe
or the woodcock. In 1828. In the drains about Laybach
in Illyria common snipes were seen in the middle of July.
The first double snipes appeared the first week in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript]
when likewise woodcocks were seen, the first Jack
snipe did not appear till more than 3 weeks later
the 29 of Sep[superscript]r[/superscript]. I was informed at Copenhagen that
the Jack snipe certainly breeds in Zeeland & I saw a
nest with its eggs said to be from the Island of Sandholme
opposite Copenhagen. & I have no doubt that this
bird & the double snipe sometimes make their nests
in the marshes of Holstein & Hannover. An excellent
sportsman & good observer informs me that in the great
royal decoy or marsh preserve near Hannover, He
has had ocular proofs of double snipes being raised
from the nest there: but these birds require solitude
& perfect quiet, & as their food is peculiar, they demand
a great extent of marshy meadow. Their stomach is the thinnest

& rest both circumstances favourable to fat.
In wet open weather they are often obliged to make
long flights & their food is more distributed.
The Jack Snipe feeds upon smaller insects than
the snipe small white larvæ such as are found
in [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] black bogs are its favourite food; but I
have generally found seeds in its stomach once hemp seeds
& always gavel. I know not where the Jack Snipe
breeds; but I suspect far North. I never saw their
nest or young ones in Germany France [insertion]Hungary Illyria[/insertion] or the British
Islands. The common snipe breeds in great quantities
in the [deletion]great[/deletion] [insertion]extensive[/insertion] marshes of Hungary & Illyria: but I do
not think the jack snipe breeds there for even
in [deletion]Aug[superscript]t[/superscript][/deletion] July & Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] with the first very dry weather
many snipes with ducks & teal come into the marshes
in the [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] of Illyria but the Jack snipe is always

[page]102|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00102|000103|000103[/page]
as if to divert the attention of the intruder, a few
snipes always breed in the marshes of [underline]England[/underline] &
Scotland but a far greater number retire for 
this purpose to the Hebrides & the Orkneys
In the hether surrounding a small lake in the Island of
Hoy in the Orkneys I found in the month of August
of 1817 the nests of 10 or 12 couple of snipes. I was
grouseshooting & my dog continually pointed
[deletion]to young snipes which[/deletion] [insertion]them and[/insertion] as these were some
times three young ones & two old ones in
the nest [insertion]this[/insertion] had a most powerful scent, from
some accident of the season these snipes
were very late in being hatched for they
usually fly before the middle of July but
this year even as late as the 15 of August
there were many young snipes that had not 
yet their wing feathers. Snipes are usually
fattest in frosty weather; which I believe is owing to this
that [deletion]they[/deletion] in such weather they haunt only warm springs
where worms are abundant & they do not willingly quit
these places: [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] so that they have plenty of nourishment

& Brittany the woods of England particularly of the 
west & south contain allways a certain quantity
of woodcocks but these are far more in the moist
soil & warmer climate of Ireland, but in the woods
of Italy[superscript]2[/superscript] southern & Greece near marshes they are far
more abundant & they extend in quantities over the
greek islands, Asia Minor & Northern Africa
The snipe is one of the most generally distri-
=buted birds belonging to Europe. It feeds upon almost
every kind of worm or larvæ & as I have said
before its stomach sometimes contains seeds &
rice, it prefers a country cold in the summer
to breed in; but wherever there is much [insertion]fluid[/insertion] water &
great morasses this bird is almost certain to
be found. Its nest is very inartificial, its eggs
large & the young ones soon become of an enormous
size being often before they can fly larger than
their parents Two young ones are usually the
number in a nest but I have seen three. The
old birds are exceedingly attached to their off-
spring & if any one approaches near the nest
they make a loud & drumming noise above the head.

[page]104|MS-DAVY-11409-000-00104|000105|000105[/page]
but fly from wood to wood reposing & feeding on their jour-
=rney. They prefer for their haunts woods near marshes
or morasses, they hide themselves under thick bushes in
the day & fly abroad to feed in the dusk of the evening
A laurel or a holly bush is a favourite place for
their [deletion]diurnal[/deletion] repose. The thick & varnished leaves of those
trees prevents the radiation of heat from the soil &
they are less affected by the refrigerating influence of
a clear sky so that they afford a warm seat for
the woodcock. Woodcocks usually begin to fly north
on the first approach of spring & their flights are gener-
ally longer & their rests fewer at this season than
in the autumn. In the autumn they are driven
from the north to the south by the want of
food & they stop [insertion]stop[/insertion] wherever they can find food. In
the spring, there is the influence of another power-
=ful instinct added to this: the sexual feeling. They
migrate in pairs & pass as speedily as possible to the
place where they are likely to find food & to raise
their young & of which the old birds have already
had the experience of former years [deletion]few[/deletion] [insertion]scarcely any[/insertion] woodcocks
winter in any part of Germany. In France there are a few
found particularly in the southern provinces & in Normandy

[Ink symbols doodled in margin before first few lines] their instincts altered by the accident of their being born
in England; & being in a place well supplied with food
it is not improbable that they raised likewise young
ones & that the habit of staying has become hereditary
There can be no doubt that woodcocks are very constant
to their local attachments; woodcocks that have been
preserved in a particular wood for a winter always return
to it if possible the next season. Many woodcocks breed
in Norway & Sweden in the great extensive & moist
pine woods filled with bogs & morasses which cover
these wild countries but probably a still greater
number breed [deletion]still[/deletion] farther north in Lapland Finland
Russia & Siberia. It is I believe a fable that they [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
raise their young habitually in the high alpine or
mountainous countries of the central or southern
parts of Europe. These countries indeed in summer are
very better fitted for their feeding, they cannot bore
where it is either dry or frosty & the glaciers or the
[deletion]dry[/deletion] [insertion]arid[/insertion] sand [insertion]or rock[/insertion] are equally unfitted for their haunts. They
leave the north with the first frosts & travel
slowly south till they come to their accustomed
[deletion]haunts[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]res[/deletion] winter quarters[/insertion] they do not usually make a quick voyage

I shall say a few words on the congeners of this bird [insertion]the solitary snipe[/insertion]
& on the three varieties so much better known in Europe
The woodcock feeds indiscriminately upon earthworms
small beetles & various kinds of larvæ & its stomach
sometimes contains seeds which I suspect have been
taken up in boring amongst the excrements of cattle
yet the stomach of this bird has something of the
gizzard character tho not so much as that of the land
=rail which I have found half filled with seeds of
grasses & even containing corn mixed with maybugs
earthworms, grasshoppers and caterpillars. The woodcock
I believe breeds habitually only in high northern latitudes
yet there are woods in England particularly one
in Sussex near the borders of Hampshire in which
one or two couple of these birds it is said may always
be found in summer; I suspect these woodcocks are [deletion]the[/deletion]
[insertion]from the[/insertion] offspring of birds which had paired for their passage
& which were detained by an accident happening
to one of them & which staid & raised a young
brood in England & the young ones probably had

It is possible that under very great pressure
even the metals of the alkalies would not
decompose water - How far electricity is
concerned may be tried in the instance of
carbonic acid marble & sulphuric acid
- If therefore there are electrical currents
even in the depths of the ocean earths
& alkalies may be decomposed - It is probable however
that there is an internal energy on our system
of which we are still ignorant

As the attraction of Barytes for water is 
very much at high heat, where the [unclear]volatity[/unclear]
of the water is amazingly increased under common
pressure so the attraction of alumine &
silex for water under high heat where there is great
pressure may be sufficient to occasion first the 
formation of a hydrate & afterwards of a solution
that Alumine can combine with water formed
by Wavellite - & as carbonic acid dissolves
lime so under greater pressure may water
dissolve the Earths - Now is it necessary
to prove this view that the Earths found
in veins should be hydrates for there
are many instances of dissolution where the
