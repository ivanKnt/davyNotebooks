Phil. - I have been attentively
listening to [deletion]you[/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] description - The
views which O has taken of X[superscript]y[/superscript]
certainly [deletion]displays it[/deletion] [superscript]have thrown a[/superscript] light over
[deletion]which I never saw it before[/deletion] it, perfectly
new to me & I must say in
candour but I am disposed to
adopt his view of the early state
of Society rather than that of
my genius - I have always
been accustomed to consider
religious one feeling as instinctive
but Ambrosios [deletion]has given[/deletion]
arguments [insertion]have[/insertion] given [insertion]me something approaching[/insertion] to a definite
faith for an obscure & undefined
[deletion][unclear]notion xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] notion |_ I am willing to allow
that Man was created not
a savage as He is represented
in my vision but perfect in
his faculties & with a variety of
instinctive powers & knowledge -
That He transmitted these powers
& Knowledge to his offspring: but
that by an improper use of reason
in disobedience to the divine
will. the instinctive faculties
