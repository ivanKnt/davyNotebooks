that the Saints are crowned
with palms & amaranths &
that they are [deletion]employed in[/deletion] described
[insertion]as[/insertion] hymning & [insertion]perpetually[/insertion] praising God -
[underline]Ambrosio[/underline] - [deletion]Music in[/deletion]
This is evidently only
metaphorical - Music is
the [insertion]sensible[/insertion] pleasure which approaches
nearest to an intellectual
one & probably may represent
the delight resultg from
the perception of the harmony
of things & of truth seen
in god. The palm [unclear][deletion]&[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]on[/unclear] an
evergreen tree & the
amaranth [deletion]&[/deletion] on a perdurable
flower are emblems of
immortality.
If I am allowed to
give one metaphorical
allusion to the [unclear]future[/unclear]
