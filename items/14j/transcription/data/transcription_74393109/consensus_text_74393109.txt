a creature can influence
the decrees of omnipotence

Ambrosio - You mistake
me. - As to how
[unclear]influcing[/unclear] or affecting
the supreme mind it is
is out of the question
But they affect your
own mind; they perpetuate
a habit of gratitude
& of obedience, [unclear]though[/unclear]
may gradually end
in perfect faith -
They discipline the affections
[deletion]mind[/deletion] & keep the heart
in a state of preparation
