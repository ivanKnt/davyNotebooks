to receive & preserve all good &
pious feelings - - Who ever
passes from utter darkness
into bright sunshine, finds
that He can not at first
[deletion][unclear]see more in one[/unclear][/deletion] distinguish
objects better in one than
in the other [deletion]& He is[/deletion]
but in a feebler light
He acquires gradually
the power of bearing the
brighter one & gains at last
the habit not only of
supporting it, but of
receiving delight as well
as instruction from it -
In the pious contemplations
that I recommend to you
there is the twilight or
sober dawn of faith
