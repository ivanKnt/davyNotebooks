snipes only .-
25 [underline]Christmass[/underline] day cloudy & a sirocco
[unclear]shall[/unclear] stay at home feel [unclear]distressed[/unclear] & lame
To dwell upon the
Spectacle of the return
of Pio VII - as shewing
the effects of religion
the ecstasy of the Roman
People on receiving his
benediction May 24 [underline]1814[/underline].
Old Men & Matrons
sobbing like children
Kneeling in the Mud
& the rain & Umbrellas
forgotten - He blesses
the Rosary of [person_122]the Unknown[/person_122]
Who will never part
with it
