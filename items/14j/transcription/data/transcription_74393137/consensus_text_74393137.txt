accidentally at Pestum-
The hope of seeing him
again was another
of [insertion]my[/insertion] motives for wishing
to leave England
& why I know not yet
I had a decided
presentiment that I
was more likely to
meet him in [insertion]the[/insertion] Austria
[insertion]states[/insertion] than [insertion]else where even than[/insertion] in England
his own country
- For this journey
I had one companion
an early friend &
[deletion]my[/deletion] Medical advisor
