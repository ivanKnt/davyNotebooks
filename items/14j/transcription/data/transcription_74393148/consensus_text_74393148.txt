I examined this day many Torpedos
one had only three occhii the others
five.- But males & females had
five.
The fisherman says the females
have seven eggs & produce seven
[unclear]young[/unclear] ones. - I think they are
oviviparous. - [insertion]it must be 14 for they have 7 each side[/insertion] The holder[unclear]s[/unclear] of the
male as they are called are
certainly sperm tubes for the fisherman
pressed out some milt.

Both Tremoli & occhiotelle
