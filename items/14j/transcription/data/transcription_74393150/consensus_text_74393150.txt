Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] 2. -[underline] A beautiful day[/underline]
a tramontane. . Head ache continues.-
Thought this morning. In connection
with my 4 Dialogue & with the 1[superscript]st[/superscript].
That There may be some [underline]law[/underline]
(by which the [underline]etherial matter[/underline] which
forms the envelope of the [underline][unclear]monad[/unclear][/underline]
& to which its / instinctive powers
& feelings are owing ) that determines
its new being, & by which it
is carried to one generation
[underline]system[/underline] rather than to another
which is [underline]fitted[/underline] for it, & that
in the [underline]Womb[/underline] it acquires
those refined & subtle [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] organs
which [underline]afterwards mark its[/underline] hereditary
[underline]character & which determine[/underline] its
future life & actions. These
may be to the living being what
the invisible polarity of the
fine molecules of [deletion]x[/deletion] a compound
pure molecules of [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] a compound
[deletion]are[/deletion] is to its chrystalization.-
This may be affixed to the note
on [underline]Hereditary character[/underline]
[underline]On the distinguished[/underline] [underline]characters[/underline]
of Europe
