[underline]La place[/underline] when a minister
of Napoleon was rather
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] formal & grand in manner
with an air of protection
rather than of courtesy.
He spoke like a Man
not merely feeling his own
power but wishing that others
should be immediately conscious
of it. I have heard from
good authority that He was
exceedingly proud of his
orders & that He had the
star of the order of reunion
affixed to his dressing gown.
This was in 1813. In
18[deletion][unclear]17[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]20[/insertion] when I saw him again
His Master had fallen.
His manners were altered
He was become mild &
gentlemanlike & had a softer
tone of voice & more grace
