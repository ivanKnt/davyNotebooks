17. [underline]Sirocco[/underline]. warm [underline]rain overhead[/underline].
[underline]Got [/underline]a large [underline]Tremola[/underline] which I took
home with me & opened. [underline]Opened two[/underline]
in [underline]market[/underline]. [underline]a male & a female[/underline]
saw the oviducts & [underline]the seminal vessels.[/underline]
In the large one the oviducts were
very large. The ova not much
developed. . - In the stomach of
this there was an occhiotele as
large as [underline]my hand[/underline], so that the
fish feeds on its own genera . -
Examined the Torpedos [unclear]&[/unclear] organ
not soluble in water, [underline]partly coagulable[/underline]
by heat - a better conductor of
Electricity than water. I think made
of the same substance as [underline]nerves[/underline]

the nerves -

beautiful & warm day - found at
