original discovery.- In
those things which Gay
Lussac has done alone,
he has displayed much
originality, & in invention
& great acumen.- His
papers on Cyanogene are
admirable. - - . -
Arago & Biot- the former
is principally known
as a practical astronomer
the latter as a general
cultivator of physical
science. - They have made
no great discoveries &
it is not likely that
their reputation will be
lasting.-
