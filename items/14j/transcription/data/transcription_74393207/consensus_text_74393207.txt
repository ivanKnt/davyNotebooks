chemical science.- His
reasoning powers exceeded
his invention - & he
owes his reputation to
over throwing rather than
[deletion]inventing[/deletion] [insertion]discovering[/insertion].- His political
character was far from
untainted.- I saw him
a short time before he
died, in 1816, then a
very old man - He was
sitting in his Library,
he took me into his
Laboratory & Museum:-
his conversation was
chiefly confined to
what he himself had
done - in [unclear]the[/unclear] Library.
