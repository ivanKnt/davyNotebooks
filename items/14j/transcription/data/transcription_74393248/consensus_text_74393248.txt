I have made another visit
to Laybach & seen some
new & beautiful scenes. The
valley of the Southern Save
with it's cataracts & lakes
particularly struck me.
I have seen nothing so
beautiful in Europe. It
suits me better to while
away my days in this
solitary state of existence
in the contemplation of
Nature than to attempt
to enter into London
society where recollections
call up the idea of what
I was & the want of
bodily powers teaches
me what a shadow
I am. I make notes
