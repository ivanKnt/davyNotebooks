[deletion]7[/deletion] [insertion]12[/insertion] May 1828 -  observed a
number of small leeches
within the gill of the
small Hucho, which is
prepared, the skin having
been [unclear][underline]separated[/underline][/unclear] " I suppose
for preserving. -
In the four double snipes
killed on the 9[superscript]th[/superscript] there
were no larvae in the
stomach; & on the 10[superscript]th[/superscript]
searching the same place
I found no more, though
I had left five. They
were probabl preparing
to migrate by fasting,
for they were very fat
& therefore not just
arrived." -
