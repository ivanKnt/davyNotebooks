there nine years ago & the
fall in consequence more
magnificent, beautifully
clear & green, the white
foam & the green tint
like those of the fall of the
Rhine at Schafhausen"
June 19 - "Went to the
[underline]great[/underline] [underline]fall[/underline] [deletion](of the Traun)[/deletion]
where I hooked so many
grayling & found the [underline]law[/underline]
of remembrance applies to
the fish of the Traun; -
the fish rose in the same
spots, but would not [deletion]now[/deletion]
take the finest fly.- & I
caught only one small
grayling of 1/2 lb. This
might partly be owing
to the bright sunshine;
but the other is the most
efficient cause."-
