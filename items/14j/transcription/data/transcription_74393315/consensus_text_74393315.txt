of corn, clovers and maize.
There is a fine Cliff to the
right, topped by a picturesque
castle & one range of broken
hills and four distinct ranges
of mountains, the last the
bare & snowy Terglon. -
Though the valley of the Sava
winds & the meeting of the
two waters, the one bright
blue, the other sea green,
is distinctly seen, the
lavish hills have the same
vegetation as the plain;
the next range oak &
beech; the third pines, the
fourth pines & bare rock;
the fifth without any
appearance of vegetation,-
cliffs of marble or masses
of snow. By the sides, or
upon the bases of the hills
