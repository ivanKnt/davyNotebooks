river & where the scenery
was more wild & upon
a greater scale. - Here we
left the boat & walked about
a mile to the fall of the
Mandals river, which is
rather a rapid than a fall
a succession of foaming streams
& pool, where the water
leaps from rock to rock
from 4 to 10 feet &
over which Salmon easily
make their way. The narrow
channel through which the
river runs is very picturesque
& the birch trees grow close
to the fall as if out of
the granite rocks. The sun
was bright, yet I thought
myself sure of a salmon;
but my skill was vain
