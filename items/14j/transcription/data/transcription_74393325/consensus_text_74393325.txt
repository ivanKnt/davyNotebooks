mountain ash & birch &
oak in profusion. Every
moment we opened upon
a new scene as we passed
by in our boat. We asked
if there was no fresh
water near, looking for
a stream which we might
fish. They carried us to
a spot where evidently
a torrent sometimes passed
& in less than 20 yards
we found ourselves on the
rocky brink of an inland
fresh water lake as beauti
ful as the upper lake of
Killarney & something like
it. Here we fished without
success, but we were re-
compensed by the agreeable
nature of the scenery which
was exquisitely beautiful
