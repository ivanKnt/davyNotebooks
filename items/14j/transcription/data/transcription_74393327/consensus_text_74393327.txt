Christian sand. The harbour
itself is a very fine one with
the peculiar Norwegian
features of rocky islands,
high granite crags.. more
or less covered with trees &
promontories generally topped
with firs. The quantity of
firs was greater on this
coast, than at Mandals &
the valley of the Torndale
displayed more fir wood than
wood of any other kind, yet
occasionally birch, alder &
oak appeared on the banks
& birch was not uncommon
The glen leading to the
Torridale was narrower
but the rocks on a grander
scale, than any thing we
had yet seen. The river itself
a fine majestic stream, as
large as the Rhone at Lyons
