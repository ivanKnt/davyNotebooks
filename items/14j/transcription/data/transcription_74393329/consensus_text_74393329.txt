water close to the houses. Trees
crown the rocks & neat little
houses come close to the waters
edge. I went immediately to
a beautiful wooded rock just
above the town, where the
Mandal scenery appeared
as if echoed upon the
river of Arendal I likewise
went to visit the iron mines
which are very curious in
sienite with all the [underline]rare[/underline]
[underline]specimens[/underline] well known to
mineralogists. One of the Mines
presents a very [deletion]curious[/deletion] fine
excavation & you look out
upon a tranquil little lake
with pastoral & wooded scenery
around it. The day after a
row to the fall of the river;
not so large as that of the
Torridale but with the same
features; the banks pastoral
the usual vegetation below
