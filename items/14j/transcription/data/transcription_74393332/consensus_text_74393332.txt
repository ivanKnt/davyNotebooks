the largest river in Norway. The
masses of granite in these islands
are larger; the underwood &
flower bearing wood less &
the whole scenery ruder. The
stream rather whitish, but
not muddy, flowed rapidly
by the rocks, yet we moved
more rapidly against it &
soon anchored before Fredericshal
The fall of the Glommen
being only six English miles
off I ordered the Captain
to sail up the Stream to
it & we had a most
brilliant evening, dashing
through the rapids of this
immense river which I
think exceeds in size the
Danube at Vienna. The
banks were beautiful
but not wild, cornfields
