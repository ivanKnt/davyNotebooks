"I have written to you
but I fear you have
not yet the letter. I
have this moment received
your address. I am
dying - Come as quickly
as you can, you will
not see me alive I
am afraid
God bless you" -

get his first letter, [deletion]indeed[/deletion]
in time, indeed it
followed me to Geneva
where I found it [deletion]on[/deletion]
on our arrival from
Rome & I read it
only a few hours
