as a Brother, a teacher
& most kind friend, &
to whom I necessarily
owed very much of
what I most valued
in my life. My anxiety
naturally increased [deletion]as[/deletion]
the nearer I came to
[deletion][unclear]him[/unclear][/deletion] Rome; in vain I
sought for fresh letters
or additional information
at Naples: - when I
entered Rome, I knew
not where to find him
for his address in that
City was not sent; I
in vain went from
our Hotel to another
