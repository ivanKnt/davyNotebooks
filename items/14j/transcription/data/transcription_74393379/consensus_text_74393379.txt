the intellect was perfectly
clear; - the functions
were tolerably well
performed, - the pulse
not very rapid, - &
he has so far recovered
the power, of the
muscles of his limbs,
that with some aid
he could rise &
go into the sitting
room & that day
he rose & dined
in his room &
made a tolerable
dinner on some roast
chicken & spinage.
