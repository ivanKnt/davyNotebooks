request I read to him,
about the first half
of M[superscript]r[/superscript] [unclear]Moore's[/unclear] Epicurean;-
the sad colouring &
melancholy sentiment
which pervades that
elegant little work
with the wildness of
some part of the fiction
& it's marvellous subter
raneous scenery &
incident amused him
much - At night he
would not allow me
to remain in his room
not even on a couch as
I had [insertion]done[/insertion] before; - he was sure
he should die that
night - he took leave
