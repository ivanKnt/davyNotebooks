highest veneration for this great
[deletion]acute[/deletion] reasoner the founder
of modern philosophical logic
I think [unclear]there[/unclear] is little of
[unclear]acuteness[/unclear] or of his usual
strength of mind in his death.
It appears to me that [unclear]He[/unclear]
might as well have asked
whether it might not have
pleased God to make a
[unclear]Home[/unclear] its own tenant.-
Argument from Scripture -
new [unclear]organs give[/unclear] to Spirit
in every scheme, purified by fire
God of the living not of the [underline]dead[/underline]-
The creation of [underline]Adam[/underline]. The organs
the spirit given after he [unclear]organs[/unclear]
were formed -
[underline]Conscience[/underline] probably [deletion]belongs[/deletion] [insertion]remains[/insertion]
[underline]from another state[/underline] of existence
[underline]Mind creative[/underline].
