who have imagined that
by organization power not
naturally belonging to matter
were developed & that sensibility
was a property belonging
to some [deletion][unclear]etherial[/unclear][/deletion] unknown
ethereal combinations of
matter. but such notions
appear to me unphilosophical
& the mere substitution of
unknown words for unknown
things. [deletion]But[/deletion] I can
never believe that any
division or refinement
or subtil[deletion]ation[/deletion]ization of
or juxtaposition [insertion]or arrangement[/insertion] of the
particles of matter can
give to them sensibility
