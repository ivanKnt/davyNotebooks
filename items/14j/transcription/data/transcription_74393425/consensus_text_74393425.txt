[deletion]We When[/deletion]
We are all portions of the
breath of the same infinite
Intelligence raised by it &
returning to it but like
streams produced by the
the falls of waters from the
atmosphere we return to
the deep & eternal ocean
by different courses. True
in infancy or early youth
by a quick rapid & impetuous
[underline]termination[/underline] as a momentary
torrents; others in manhood
as great vigorous and pow-
erful rivers; & others as in
old age by a slow winding
& tortuous course having
lost as it were half their
waters in their channels
[deletion]& empty[/deletion] it slowly at last
[insertion]falling[/insertion] thro' many scanty & sandy
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] mouths.
