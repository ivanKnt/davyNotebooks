            He was one of the people who helped appoint Davy to the Royal Institution. Following

            Roman Empire in 1792. His appointment in the late 1790s as Bavarian ambassador to
            London created a minor diplomatic incident, during which he helped establish and manage
            the Royal Institution, in the course of which he appointed Davy to lecture there.
            Later he married Lavoisier's widow and lived unhappily ever after. FRSL.</p>

            1800) and moved to Birmingham where he went into partnership with the businessman
            and industrialist Matthew Boulton. They made their fortune by having an effective
