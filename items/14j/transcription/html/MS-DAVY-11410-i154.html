         <p>A central figure in English natural philosophy and chemistry, among other research
            he determined the density of the earth and discovered what would later be named hydrogen.
            He was one of the people who helped appoint Davy to the Royal Institution. Following
            his death in 1810 Davy delivered a widely-quoted eulogy on Cavendish and later arranged
            for some of his apparatus to be transferred to the Royal Institution. FRSL. </p>

         <p>A member of the Lincolnshire gentry, Banks sailed as a botanist on James Cook's first
            voyage to the Pacific (1768-1771). Elected President of the Royal Society of London
            in 1778 he served for forty-two years until just before his death. The dominant figure
            in the running of English science during that time, he became one of Davy's patrons
            and ultimately Davy succeeded him to the Presidency. FRSL.</p>
