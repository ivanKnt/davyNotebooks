a certain contagious disease

Besides, I suppose the

of their gratitude in
renouncing what perhaps was
dearest to them as an act
of faith & again because
in so doing, by securing
more than was essential
for their existence, they
were preserved from the
danger of famine; as in
case of a death it was
easy for the Priests to
apply the offerings to the

of human nature-
Ambro.- Revelation
has not [deletion]revealed[/deletion] [insertion]disclosed to us[/insertion] the
nature of this state but
only fixed its [deletion]security[/deletion] certainty.
We are sure from geological
facts as well as from
[deletion]other[/deletion] sacred history that
Man is a recent animal
on the globe, & that this
globe has undergone one

[page]43||dnp14j041pp|74393100[/page]

considerable revolution since the
creation by water & we are taught
that it is to undergo another
by fire preparatory to a
new & glorified state of existence
of Man - but this is all
we are permitted to know -
& as this state is to be entirely
different from the present
one of misery & probation, any
knowledge respecting it would
be [unclear]melef[/unclear] & indeed almost
be useless & indeed almost
impossible -
Phil.
[deletion]The[/deletion] [/deletion] My genius has placed

Ambro-. Human fancy may

imagine a thousand manners
in which it may be produced
but upon such notions it
is absurd to dwell. I will

So by revelation
The light of an imperishable

it is in [deletion]the distance futurity[/deletion] [insertion]eternity[/insertion]

that the Saints are crowned

That There may be some [underline]law[/underline]
(by which the [underline]etherial matter[/underline] which
forms the envelope of the [underline][unclear]monad[/unclear][/underline]
& to which its / instinctive powers
& feelings are owing ) that determines
its new being, & by which it
is carried to one generation
[underline]system[/underline] rather than to another
which is [underline]fitted[/underline] for it, & that
in the [underline]Womb[/underline] it acquires
those refined & subtle [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] organs
which [underline]afterwards mark its[/underline] hereditary
[underline]character & which determine[/underline] its

may be to the living being what

[underline]La place[/underline] when a minister
of Napoleon was rather
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] formal & grand in manner
with an air of protection
rather than of courtesy.
He spoke like a Man
not merely feeling his own
power but wishing that others
should be immediately conscious
of it. I have heard from
good authority that He was
exceedingly proud of his
orders & that He had the
star of the order of reunion
affixed to his dressing gown.
This was in 1813. In
18[deletion][unclear]17[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]20[/insertion] when I saw him again
His Master had fallen.

gentlemanlike & had a softer
tone of voice & more grace

93
[deletion]of manner.[/deletion] [insertion]in his forms of salutation[/insertion] I remember
the first day I saw him
which was I believe in Nov[superscript]r[/superscript] 1813.
On my speaking to him of the
atomic theory in Chemistry &
expressing my belief that this
Science would alternately be
referred to Mathem . Laws
similar to those which He had
so profoundly & successfully
exhibited with respect to
the mechanical properties of
matter; He treated my idea in
[deletion]with[/deletion] a tone bordering on contempt
as if angry that [underline]any [unclear]results[/unclear][/underline]
in Chemistry could even in their
future [insertion]possibilities[/insertion] be compared with his
own labours. When I dined
with him in 1820. He discussed
the [insertion]same[/insertion] opinion with acumen &
candour & allowed all the
merit of John Dalton.
It is true our positions had
changed, He was now amongst
the old aristocracy of France &
no longer the intellectual head
of the new Aristocracy & from

a young & humble aspirant
to chemical glory, I was
about to be called by the voice
of my collea[deletion]u[/deletion]gues to a chair
which had been honoured by
the last days of Newton. -
I remember that day I sat
next to Madame La Mar[superscript]s[/superscript] la

& amused by the extreme lightness
of her manners & the strange
& wild [unclear]though amiable[/unclear] tone of
her conversation. [deletion]It[/deletion] She had
the remains of beauty & I
should think still inclinations

court at Florence with [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]rapture[/underline]
[deletion]& [unclear]ser[/unclear][/deletion] & of [deletion]some[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] Tuscan friend

Article [underline]Grayling[/underline]. -
The Grayling is a more
gregarious fish than the
trout but not so much so
as the perch. (text)
[underline]Note[/underline]. Solitary fish in general
or fish that associate [insertion]only[/insertion] during
the time of sexual connexions
have usually more fixed
haunts than gregarious
fish who generally
choose pools of a size &

[page]109||dnp14j107pp|74393166[/page]
[underline]107[/underline]
form fitted for their motion
or food. The pike for instance
or a large trout generally
fixes him self near a [deletion]large[/deletion] [insertion]great[/insertion]
stone or bank or trunk
of a tree to which he
can retire in case of alarm
but this is seldom the case
with [underline]Grayling[/underline] or even with
small trout which often
associate together. The
trout being a fish of prey
& which sometimes destroys
even its own kind is not
likely when large to be
followed by small trout
but the Grayling which is
certainly innocuous to its
own species at least even
when of The largest size
is often followed by
smaller ones. |_ It is very
difficult to explain the

[page]110||dnp14j108pp|74393167[/page]
cause of the gregarious
associations of fish
but it is probably gener
=ally connected with the
search[deletion]ing[/deletion] [insertion]after[/insertion] their food & in
some cases perhaps
nourishment is supplied
to water by fish . I [deletion]have[/deletion]
observed [insertion]in 1828[/insertion] in a branch of
the Save at Lustthal
near Laibach a young
Sturgeon which was
preserved as a curiosity
having been brought there
from the Danube. it was
always surrounded by
great numbers of the
[deletion]Eider[/deletion] [insertion]ida[/insertion] carp or breitfisch
which seemed to have
great satisfaction in

were likewise some grayling
which [deletion]seemed[/deletion] [insertion]appeared[/insertion] to cultivate
the same kind of acquain[deletion]t[/deletion]

fish is always covered
with a [deletion][unclear]dead[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]thick[/insertion] slime & it is
not I think improbable
that the other fish [unclear]derive[/unclear]
nourishment from it.
The ancients had many
singular ideas respecting
the fondness or antipathies
of certain species of fish
with respect to each other
They believed that there was
a strong antipathy beteen
the Muraena & the Congor

at Rome certainly two distinct

of common eel. These
fishes being all extremely
rapacious & feeding in
the same haunts I have
no doubt destroy each
other whenever they can
The identity of the vari.
eties of fish known
to the ancients is a
curious subject of
scientific enquiry -
The ancient Romans
seem to have preserved
their fish & to have pre.

The Muraena is now a
rare fish in the roman
market & is not much
esteemed by the italians
spotted like a snake
& slimy like an eel
it seems to require some
particular sauce or some
peculiar coating to give
it that character
which the Romans of
the Time of Augustus
attributed to it of being
the most delicate of
Sea fishes. I have
eaten it boiled & fried
in paper & cannot
say that it struck me
as being equal to a
good eel of the Skerries
It was less fat & I

the distinguished characters
Europe "-
The following sketches of the
characters of some of the
distinguished men with whom
my Brother was acquainted,
were written at Rome
in Feb. 1829, a short time
before the [unclear]commencement[/unclear]
of his last illness .- A
metaphysical reflection
appears to have suggested
to his mind the plan
of writing these sketches.
I shall transcribe the
reflection as I find it
in his common place book
"Thought This morning in
connexion with my 4[superscript]th[/superscript]

law, by which the [underline]Etherial[/underline]

to which its instructive
powers & feelings are

its new being, & by which
it is carried to one
generative system rather
than to another, which is
[underline]fitted[/underline] for it, & that in
the [underline]womb[/underline], it acquires
those refined & subtile
organs, which [underline]afterwards[/underline]
mark its [unclear]headstrong[/unclear]
character, & which determine
its future life &
actions . These may be to

He adds ," This may be
affixed to the note on

and, then follow the sketches
[deletion]of some distinguished men[/deletion]
evidently from the writing
[deletion]another[/deletion] [insertion]commenced[/insertion] immediately after,
with [deletion]the[/deletion] the heading
already given - We think

Soon after he resumed the
subject in another note
book; referring to the
former thus "In the
green book marked
Rome 1829 date Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] 2
were some notes con -
nected with the 6 Dialogue
on the characters of the
illustrious men of the
19 Century " - Then he
gives sketches of some
others in his own hand writing
as far as Babington's -
Immediately after written
by his amanuensis is
the remark "For the
characters of some other
philosophers who have

[page]130||dnp14j128pp|74393187[/page]
departed from this one scene
of action before these pages
were written I refer to
the annual discourses
read since 1820 to the
Royal Society. I particularly
wish to mention those of
Herschel, Jenner, [deletion][unclear]Bayley[/unclear][/deletion]
Baillie & Marcet ( &
he adds ) I shall give
a few gleanings more from
the scientific & literary
academies. - Ampere is

[page]131||dnp14j129pp|74393188[/page]
129
must have been dictated
during the severity &
early part of his last
illness, before I arrived
at Rome .- It will
display the playfulness
of his genius & even
its sprightly vivacity
at a time when common
minds are over powered.
Some reflections on the
state of Science in
America associated
with the giving of the
character of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Woodhouse
led to [deletion]rem[/deletion] remarks
 & [unclear][deletion]a[/deletion] Lectures[/unclear] on the
same subject in England

[page]132||dnp14j130pp|74393189[/page]
& especially on the state
of the British Museum,
it's faults, & how they
might be removed &
the Institution rendered
worthy of the country to
which it belongs &
a useful ornament.-
When I joined him, he
directed my attention
to these sketches, said
they might if it was
thought proper be published
at some future time,
after the death of the
individuals - but that
his remarks on the
British Museum, might

[page]133||dnp14j131pp|74393190[/page]
131
be published immediately.
I never witnessed him before
more intent on literary
labours & anxious to be
useful - indeed there was
undue excitement of mind,
a morbid activity - &
[deletion]yet healthy action[/deletion], which
was [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] extraordinary [insertion]healthy action;[/insertion] 
There was no delirium
no feebleness of judgment,
He gave me an idea
of a dying Prophet, under
the influence of a superior
agency -

It is my intention to
collect materials for the
biography of my Brother
& I hope a time may
arrive when I shall have
leisure to arrange them
& give a connected
account of him. I [unclear]could[/unclear]
wish to display the
character of his mind,
his manner of thinking,
reasoning & inventing
& also his social qualities
in brief to give a picture
of him as a Man & as
a philosopher - Should I
not live to accomplish
what I wish, - the

[page]136||dnp14j134pp|74393193[/page]
collected; may be useful
& perhaps even may be
more valued than the
work I contemplate. The
sources from whence I
derive my information
are 1[superscript]st[/superscript] his note books ,
of which I have a series
(interrupted indeed) from
the time he began his
private studies, his self-
education, soon after
quitting the Grammar school
of his respected master
the Rev. D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Cardew of
Truro, to the moment of
the commencement of [deletion]his[/deletion]
the illness which ultimately

[page]137||dnp14j135pp|74393194[/page]
135
proved fatal; - 2[superscript]dly[/superscript]. his
correspondence ; 3[superscript]dly[/superscript]. my
personal knowledge &
his oral communications
to me & 4[superscript]ly[/superscript]. the recollections
of his friends especially
of his very early ones .-
In collecting, I shall observe
no method not having
it in my power to follow
the [unclear]order[/unclear] I could wish,
from my distance from
home & not having the
whole of his note books
with me - indeed with the
exceptions of two of the
very earliest only those
which he had with him

[page]138||dnp14j136pp|74393195[/page]
at the time of his death,
& which related chiefly
to the two or three last
years of his life.-
His note books, it may be
remarked, are not kept in
any systematic manner,
especially those which he
used on his travels - all
kinds of subjects are
intermixed in them; they
were literally common place
books - remarks in natural
history; metaphysical
thoughts; poetical ideas.-
queries, bon mots,- sketches
of characters are [deletion]given[/deletion]
put down, as they [deletion]occu[/deletion]
arose in his mind. - His

[page]139||dnp14j137pp|74393196[/page]
137
mind was [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] eminently
systematic & logical
in [unclear]exertion[/unclear]; he neglected
mechanical arrangement
so that a person ignorant
of him, & looking carelessly
either at his memoranda
or papers, or books or
apparatus would naturally
infer that he must have
been deficient in precision
& order- [deletion]&[/deletion] He required less
than any other person I have
known the aid of mechanical
arrangement - his productions
were very much the creations
of his mind - & originality
was their distinctive feature.

[page]140||dnp14j138pp|74393197[/page]
& hence probably the apparent
disorder alluded to in the
materials which he worked
on .-
La Place very early
distinguished himself in
conjunction with Lavoisier
in physico - chemical
researches.- The demerit
is attached to him of
forsaking his friend
in adversity & he partakes
with his revolutionary colleagues
in a high degree of the
stigma of his execution.
I saw [deletion]him[/deletion] La Place
'but once, it was a
short time before his death
& at the Institute - He was
a graceful courteous old man
& the phenomenon as it were
of the assembly.

[page]141||dnp14j139pp|74393198[/page]
139
To these sketches of characters
I shall add a few notes from
recollection, which may be
acceptable to some of my
friends, even though confined
to M. S. -
Berthollet's writings are
only known to the Chemical
Philosopher; - to them he
owed his distinction & honours
[deletion][unclear]at a time[/unclear] & in a country[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] His greatest discovery
was the [deletion]discovery[/deletion] composition
of the volatile alkali; - his
statical chemistry was
his principal work - It was
in great estimation, for
some time, but the doctrines
were incorrect & con-
sequently it is now almost

[page]142||dnp14j140pp|74393199[/page]
forgotten [unclear]if had[/unclear] Berthollet been
right, Chemistry would
have been degraded almost
to an art - it would have
been the most vague &
indefinite of the sciences - &
it's results beyond all
calculation .-
Chaptal [insertion]out of France[/insertion] is principally
known by his writings
on the chemical arts -
& especially by his
work on Wires. He
is not a chemical
discoverer & in all
his writings there is
a deficiency of original
thinking & invention.-

[deletion]of my Brother[/deletion] the brilliant
& marvellous discoveries

Piazza's lasting reputation
is founded on his discovery
of [deletion]two small[/deletion] [insertion]two[/insertion] minute
planets. [deletion]Pallas & Vesta[/deletion]

[page]144||dnp14j142pp|74393201[/page]
Whilst living he had high
reputation as a practical
astronomer; & such [deletion][unclear]he[/unclear][/deletion] it
will descend to posterity.-
[underline]Morichini[/underline].- was a Roman
Physician & professor of
Chemistry in the collenge
[deletion]of the[/deletion] Sapienza at Rome.
He is only generally
known as having first
ascertained the magnetizing
power of a portion of
the solar spectrum. His
manner was very engaging
gentle, & affectionate &
gave the idea of a most
amiable man.- During
my Brothers last illness
when he considered his
case beyond the reach

[page]145||dnp14j143pp|74393202[/page]
143
of art, & did not wish
to take medicine or [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
receive the attendance of
medical men, he was always
glad to see Morichini
as a friend.-
[underline]Gay-Lussac & Thenard[/underline] - will
long be associated in the re-
collection of the Chemists of
the present time & in the
history of Chemistry, - having
laboured much together.-
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]. My Brother always
did them justice, tho' on
several occasions, they
hunted the game which
he had [unclear]started[/unclear], - &
following after, [deletion]took to themselves[/deletion]
assumed the merit of

[page]146||dnp14j144pp|74393203[/page]
original discovery.- In
those things which Gay
Lussac has done alone,
he has displayed much
originality, & in invention
& great acumen.- His
papers on Cyanogene are
admirable. - - . -
Arago & Biot- the former
is principally known
as a practical astronomer
the latter as a general
cultivator of physical
science. - They have made
no great discoveries &
it is not likely that
their reputation will be
lasting.-

[page]147||dnp14j145pp|74393204[/page]
145
Beddoes - had much more a
genius than judgement;- he
was chimerical in the
extreme & truly belonged
to a revolutionary period .
Impatient in investigation
& indulging in loose analogies
he passed through life in
a current of errors.- My
Brother began his public
career in an institution
which he established with
the aid of his friends,
it was called the Pneumatic
Institution & the object
of it was to make
trial of the Medicinal
effects of the different gasses
at the age of 20 my
Brother was offered the

[page]148||dnp14j146pp|74393205[/page]
direction of it. At Clifton
where it was established,
he made his experiments
on nitrous oxide &
the different combinations
of azote, [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] which form
the principal part of
his "Researches &c a
work which on its
first appearance
established his character
as a Chemical Philosopher.
Beddoes I believe had
a great regard for
my Brother - & the
feeling was returned.
I was present when he
received a letter intimating

[page]149||dnp14j147pp|74393206[/page]
147
his death; - we were then
engaged in the Laboratory
of the Royal institution
in an interesting chemical
experiment - He said
"So - poor D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes is
dead "- He shed [deletion]a few[/deletion]
some tears; made an

character was far from
untainted.- I saw him
a short time before he
died, in 1816, then a

drove him out of the room

& ran away - He died
with a million & half of
money - He appeared
totally indifferent in all

him, & begged to remind
him, there was a balance
of a very large sum

he thought it his duty

was pettish & remarked
quickly - [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] it was
no business of his
to make such a

His zeal was different from
that of Mr Hatchett for
scientific research,-
out lived his faculties. He
was a most indefatigable

at length became almost
[unclear]disgraceful[/unclear] to the Society.-
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Brande very much
disappointed my Brother;
as a young man he thought

he shewed much activity -
& in a few years he had
possession of almost every

He was mercenary &

an apothecary, - & he

& they died about the same
time.- The day we arrived
at Geneva we heard of
Dr. Young's death; Lady
Davy mentioned it in
a guarded manner; it
affected him very power

refraining from tears

his scientific attainments
He gave several courses of
lectures on natural Philosophy
at the Royal Institution
& was for many years
Lecturer on Chemistry at the
Burrow Hospitals.- His
countenance, voice & manner
were pleasing : & without
eloquence or any high
powers of mind he was
listened to with attention
& pleasure.- of late years
he has followed very much
the example of Howard &
has travelled over the
greater part of Europe &
has visited some parts
of Asia with the

[page]174||dnp14j172pp|74393231[/page]
philanthropic design of
promoting the education of

His manner, aspect &
dress were strikingly con

very loud; the shake &

on account (as he often ex-
plained) of a general tendency
to sore throat, & in his
dress there was a certain
ostentation of finery -
masking vulgarity .-
His scientific character
was an introduction to the
society of some of the
most distinguished men
& at club dinners, it 
was not uncommon to see
him, seated by a peer
of the realm & perfectly
at his ease.-
Professor Buckland is
chiefly known to the
world by his Reliquiae

undoubtedly of much merit

D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Babington, was a distin

he began his career as

He was too much engaged
in the practise of his
profession to be able to
devote himself to science
& [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] even in [deletion]his[/deletion] Medicine
he has written nothing
deserving of being mentioned
he began his career as

[page]177||dnp14j175pp|74393234[/page]
175
He was one of my Brothers
oldest & truest friends; they
were attached by the
exchange of kind offices
by similarity of tastes &
feelings & by an equal
fondness for angling.
Salmonia is dedicated to
him & he is the Hall[deletion]a[/deletion]eus

was there a man who
had so many friends; - his
enemy was never heard
of; every line of his
countenance was expressive
of benevolence & good
humor. - In his old age
he retained all his
good qualities & extraordinary

[page]178||dnp14j176pp|74393235[/page]

when I suppose, he was
about 80 years of age,
he invited me to
breakfast with him at
1/2 past 9 o'clock on a
Sunday morning, having
more leisure on that
day than on any other
for conversation. I was
punctual to the time &
he presently [deletion]appeared[/deletion] [insertion]returned[/insertion]
from seeing some patients
in the neighbourhood &
he said that before
going out according his
custom he had given
two [unclear]boxes[/unclear] to the poor

[page]179||dnp14j177pp|74393236[/page]
177
prescribing at his own house
for any who chose to
consult him.- Soon after
 breakfast, he told me
we must part, his
professional engagements
calling him abroad. Then
for many years constantly
occupied, having the
most extensive practice
in the City, he has en-
joyed almost uninterrupted

[unclear][insertion]not[/insertion][/unclear] expressive of genius or

rather plain and mean,
he [unclear]owed[/unclear] the respect
in which he was
universally held

[page]181||dnp14j179pp|74393238[/page]
179
entirely to his moral &
professional character. -
His knowledge was not
profound but precise,
his sagacity was
eminently functional
He always inspired
confidence [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] in his
patients & his Brethren
knowing his strict
honour & integrity
& truth [insertion]& liberality[/insertion], never hesitated
in consulting him on
difficult cases. - Before
he died, the respect
for him in the profession
amounted almost to
veneration. The last time

[page]182||dnp14j180pp|74393239[/page]
but one that I saw him
[deletion]& then his health was[/deletion]
[deletion]declining[/deletion], was at a
public dinner of
medical men; when he
rose to leave the room
which was early in the ||
evening on account of
his then declining
health, the whole company
rose, and his health
was drank with
acclamation. - & he
was affected I believe
to tears. - The President
of the College of Physicians
was present, & he soon

[page]183||dnp14j181pp|74393240[/page]
181
after left the room &
others after him, of
the most [unclear]distinguished[/unclear]
part of the profession,
but there was no
demonstration afterwards
of similar feeling. -
His excellent judgment
was the distinctive
quality of his mind;
I remember very many
years ago his conversing
with me on the subject
of his profession, he
said that the practice
of it was the continued

[page]184||dnp14j182pp|74393241[/page]
exercise of common sense.
A nephew of the Hunters
& educated in their school
he succeeded D[superscript]r[/superscript] William
Hunter as teacher of
Anatomy. - For some years
he was almost confined
to this occupation -
it was during this
period of his life that
he [deletion][unclear]pub[/unclear][/deletion] wrote and published
his work on morbid
anatomy, by which he
will be chiefly known
to posterity - His practice
then was very limited;
he was occasionally
consulted in obscure
cases. Suddenly he

[page]185||dnp14j183pp|74393242[/page]
183
came into full employment
as a Physician, owing to
to the illness of D[superscript]r[/superscript].
Pitcairn, who well
acquainted with his
limits, recommended him
to his numerous patients.
Very soon he was under
the necessity of relinquishing
his anatomical theatre, &
[deletion]& soon after in his[/deletion]
almost immediately he
[deletion]stood[/deletion] [insertion]occupied[/insertion] in public esti-
mation the first place
in his profession. -

In writing biography it
appears to me, that the
main design should be
the development of character,
with the intention of amusing
& instructing, - [insertion]&[/insertion] that nothing
is very conducive to
these ends, provided it
has no immoral influence.
In conformity with this
view, I shall transcribe
a short [deletion]Romance[/deletion] [insertion]romantick story[/insertion], which
I found in one of his
note books, bearing date
Wurzen August 23, 1828.
He pointed it out to me
on our journey from Rome
to Geneva & presented

[page]188||dnp14j186pp|74393245[/page]
it to me, saying I might
publish it if I liked; -
That the composing of it
had given him a little
amusement & that it
might be amusing to
others. - He was throughout
life fond of novels &
Romances,- & not fastidious
about them:- the wildest
entertained him, - &
entertainment was what
he principally sought.
I have heard him remark
he would rather read
an indifferent novel the
first time, than the

[page]189||dnp14j187pp|74393246[/page]
187
very best a second. - When
he wrote this little
Romance, - his health was
bad & incompatible
with any but the
lightest exertion of the
mind. - A letter which
I had from him, in
July of the same year
Aussee in Styria
is very characteristic
of the state in which
he then was - I shall
give an extract from
it. - "Not withstanding
the long severe & depressing
malady, under which I

still labour, I am not .-.-
entirely without hope
of ultimate recovery:-
and, the few pleasures that
I retain in this my state
of Earthly purgatory have
principally reference to
the enjoyments & prospects
of my friends: & I indulge
in the idea that you are
well & happy & [underline]enjoying [/underline] a
life which I can say I
only [underline]support,[/underline] supposing
that it pleases omniscience
to preserve me for some
ends which I can not
understand, but which I

[deletion]belonging to[/deletion][insertion]of[/insertion] the divine mind. -
I have made another visit
to Laybach & seen some
new & beautiful scenes. The
valley of the Southern Save
with it's cataracts & lakes
particularly struck me.
I have seen nothing so
beautiful in Europe. It
suits me better to while
away my days in this
solitary state of existence
in the contemplation of
Nature than to attempt
to enter into London
society where recollections
call up the idea of what
I was & the want of
bodily powers teaches
me what a shadow
I am. I make notes

In this [unclear]tone[/unclear] of [unclear]x[/unclear] mind
& [insertion]valetudinary[/insertion] state of health, it is
probable that the scenery

The only [insertion]works in the form of[/insertion] Dialogues [deletion]which my[/deletion]
of my Brother which have
been published are [unclear]two[/unclear],
Salmonia or Days of Fly
fishing, & [deletion]Travels[/deletion] Consolations
in Travel, or the last days
of a Philosopher. - The first
appeared in 1828 & a 2[superscript]d[/superscript]
edition the year following. The
consolations in travel was
posthumous & edited by me
at his request. But besides
these Dialogues others or
portions were written by
him & are preserved in
MS.S. which are in my
possession - My intention now
is to give some particulars
of the circumstances under

[page]198||dnp14j196pp|74393255[/page]
which he turned his attention
to this species of composition -
& to give as far as I can
the history of the published
dialogues, in the productions
of his mind, & some idea
of the unpublished ones,
with extracts from them
I shall probably find it
necessary to be minute in
some of the details [deletion]I shall[/deletion]
[deletion]give[/deletion], - as I am of opinion
they are eminently fitted
to display his character
as a man & as a philosopher.
I shall speak of Salmonia
first: tho' it was not his
first effort in this kind
of writing. - as is mentioned

[page]199||dnp14j197pp|74393256[/page]

in its Preface it was written
during severe bodily indis-
position. - It was composed
in a very short space of time
after his return to London
from the continent in the
winter of 1827 & chiefly from
dictation. - When we travelled
together the winter before, after
his first serious attack
in the beginning of that year
he [deletion]began[/deletion] occasionally spoke
of a design to write on
fishing in connexion with
natural history - & especially
on the genus Salmo, - [deletion][unclear]as[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]the habits of [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]- &
he was [unclear]there[/unclear], [deletion]or [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] had[/deletion]

information respecting the
different species of this
extensive family of fishes,
& also respecting the habits
of animals generally but
more particularly of birds
of the migratory kind &
which exercise the art of
the Fowler, with the
intention of introducing this
curious subject & incorporating
them in one work. - and this
he accomplished, in the person
of Ornither- The other
persons of the Dialogue are

for [deletion]March[/deletion] [insertion]Jan[superscript]y[/superscript][/insertion] I believe 1829.-
The first edition, written in
haste & printed after my
Brother had set out on
another [deletion]trav[/deletion] journey in the
vain pursuit of health,
bore many marks of it,
in it's inaccuracies, especialy
of the type - However it
was very favourably received
by the public & the impression
was soon sold. - During this
spring & summer of that
year, whilst sojourning in
the Southern Provinces of
Austria, his favourite
haunts, - he made great
additions to Salmonia &
indeed almost rewrote it
for a second edition then

[page]204||dnp14j202pp|74393261[/page]
called for.- The M.S. was
transmitted to England &
the 2[superscript]d[/superscript] Edition appeared in
March. Lady Davy brought
copies with her, when she
joined him in Rome in
The latter end of that month.
He then considered himself
dying & for some hours
I was doubtful of the
propriety of showing them
to him. When they were
[deletion]show[/deletion] produced, he examined
one with great avidity,-
expressed the liveliest
interest in it & had much
pleasure in seeing how
neatly it was printed &
how well the few engravings
introduced served as

[page]205||dnp14j203pp|74393262[/page]
203
monuments. - He was almost
angry at my hesitation in
shewing it to him; I said I
ought to have known, that
nothing could have given
him more pleasure, - &
if I recollect rightly, he
remarked - that without
seeing it, he could not
die happily. Immediately
he desired me to read it
to him & in the reading
he carefully made such
corrections as were necessary.
Afterwards, when he had rallied
a little, he frequently read
new parts of it & made
some additions to it,
which will appear, should
it come, as I do not
doubt it will to a third

[page]206||dnp14j204pp|74393263[/page]
edition. The last time he
used a pen was the day we
arrived at Geneva & a few
hours before he expired;
he attempted to write in
the margins of the corrected
copy of Salmonia an anecdote
which I had related to him
in the carriage on the way
of a Dog that had been
conveyed from Badulla to
Kandy covered up in a basket
to prevent it's seeing the
road, that there might be
the less chance of his return
ing, & yet in less than
24 hours [deletion]its[/deletion] he found his
way back, a distance of
more than 30 miles by
a mountain track across

[page]207||dnp14j205pp|74393264[/page]
205
several rivers & through the
most difficult parts of the
mountainous region of the
Kandyan country.- [deletion]In[/deletion] My
Brother wished to introduce
this as bearing on the
instinctive powers of
animals; I have said he
attempted to write it, but
was obliged to desist before
he finished it; then Lady
Davy took the pen &
wrote a little & the
concluding portion is in
my own writing.-- The
interest which he took
in this work was very natural
He had always been a
lover of the angle, even from
boyhood & a successful one;

[page]208||dnp14j206pp|74393265[/page]
he was fond too of fowling-
& for this sport also had
early in life acquired a
taste - & [deletion]one[/deletion] he was passionately
fond - of the beauties of
nature, - Probably the happiest
hours of his life were
spent by the river side,.
or on the [deletion][unclear]mon[/unclear][/deletion] mountain.-
moor. - In the open air,
in the country, - at any
season of the year, but
more especially in Spring
& Autumn when in
tolerable health, he could
always throw off his cares
& rid his mind of all
annoying thoughts. - There

[page]209||dnp14j207pp|74393266[/page]
207
he recovered the hilarity
natural to his disposition
& appeared in his true
character - most cheerful
amiable & entertaining -
& the delight of his friends.
They indeed, I will now say
were almost his only true
friends who were his
associates in these Sports-
& they perhaps were almost
the only persons who
knew him.- thoroughly &
truly. - In fishing &
shooting, as in every thing
else which he undertook
he displayed great Zeal
[deletion][unclear]&[/unclear][/deletion] energy - It was not an

[page]210||dnp14j208pp|74393267[/page]
unusual thing for him to
go two or three hundred
miles for a few days fishing
& his perseverance was in
the same proportion. - I remember
fishing with him from Early
dawn to twilight in the
river Aw in June for
Salmon with little interruption
without raising a fish. -
Even to the last, he re-
tained his fondness for
angling, - just after our
arrival at Geneva, he
walked to the window of
the inn, from which the
lake is: partially seen -
& making the movement of
throwing a fly with his

arm, said, were he in
health, with such favourable
weather [deletion][unclear]in xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] he thought
at this season (it was the
29[superscript]th[/superscript] May) he could have
taken some trout :- & on
our journey, he never saw
a trout stream, without
looking at it with an
inquiring eye & once or
twice he stopped the carriage
when in a favourable
situation to observe the
water - I very much remember
our stopping at the middle
of the bridge, of the
close to Carrara
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the enjoyment he had
in looking down, on that

[page]212||dnp14j210pp|74393269[/page]
clear & beautiful stream,
rolling through a beautiful
country after its' rapid
descent from the adjacent
mountains & where in its
cool waters the Trout is
found of good size &
quality - & where some
years before he had
[deletion]ang[/deletion] angled & killed fish
[unclear]Nor[/unclear], can I forget the
pleasure he expected when
on mount Cenis I pro-
cured some Trout for him
from the tank in the
monastery of Mount Cenis
& collected some particulars
as to the temperature of
the water & fish; then

[page]213||dnp14j211pp|74393270[/page]
211
[deletion]all[/deletion] much of his wanted
animation returned - &
he handled the fish
with the fondness of an
old angler & naturalist.
at no period of [deletion]lif[/deletion] his
life did he relinquish
angling, excepting at
the commencement of his
public career, - [deletion]during[/deletion] [insertion]whilst[/insertion]
[deletion]this period[/deletion] he was at
Clifton & the first year
or two he was in London
where all his faculties
were strained in the
pursuits of science
under the impulse of
[deletion]strong[/deletion] [insertion]lofty[/insertion] ambition & [insertion]an[/insertion] intense

[page]214||dnp14j212pp|74393271[/page]
desire which he possessed
of distinguishing himself,
extending the boundaries of
human knowledge & benefiting
mankind. - When he re-
sumed angling, he pursued
it I may say passionatey
for some years - & never
used his gun - The time
however arrived, I think
it was soon after his marriage
that he seemed to prefer
his gun to his rod;- [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] &
probably the reason for this
was, that then he was
much in the country in
the autumn & followed
fishing & shooting more
than formerly for

[page]215||dnp14j213pp|74393272[/page]
213
amusement & less as mere
relaxation from his scientific
labour & the dissipation
of London Society. - Latterly
it is difficult to say which
he preferred - [deletion][unclear]perhaps[/unclear][/deletion] the
preference I believe was
very much decided by
the kind of sport - the
Salmo Hucho of the branches
of the Danube in Southern
Austria - & the [unclear]double[/unclear]
snipe in the marshes of
Rome or Ravenna, would
be to him nearly equally
attractive - By connecting
both sports with natural
history, he gave them a
kind of importance &

[page]216||dnp14j214pp|74393273[/page]
interest not their own - & made
them as it were rational-
His notebooks shew this very
remarkably - they contain not
merely the minutes of his
day's sport - but also the
results of his observations [deletion]&[/deletion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] for the purposes of
distinguishing species &
identifying them & ascer
taining their routes in
migration, - their peculiar
diet & habits.- He was a
better angler than he was
Fowler - indeed he was the
most successful angler I
ever knew - he threw his
fly with great delicacy
& dexterity- & [deletion]understood[/deletion] had
a [unclear]tact[/unclear] & knowledge which

[page]217||dnp14j215pp|74393274[/page]
215
made him very superior to
the common angler however
much practised. - Salmon-
fishing he was very successful
in; but I believe [deletion][unclear]wants[/unclear][/deletion] he
was most successful in
Trout-fishing in which
he had most experience.
His tackle was curious
& elaborate- He [insertion]seems to have[/insertion] had pleasure
in collecting the gay materials
necessary for dressing flies
tho' he seldom used them
himself, excepting on emergency
having been always too
much occupied to have had
leisure to apply himself
much to fly-making. -
an art it is impossible

attain tolerable skill in
without much practice. -
I am sorry I have not a
portrait of him, in his best
days in his anglers attire
It was in a manner not
unoriginal & considerably
picturesque- a white, low
crowned hat with a broad
brim, it's under surface green
as a protection from the
sun; garnished, if I may
use the term, after a few
hours fishing with various
flies of which trial had
been made, as was usually
the case; - a jacket either
grey or green single

nearly 18 inches in diameter
& having antennae several feet
in length. Above our heads
was a bright blue sky seen
through a kind of telescope
of high rocks, covered with
wood - the wood of England,
oak, birch, alder & some
few pines & wild roses &
woodbines. - The steam boat was
so close to the rocks that we
landed on them by a board, & it
was a matter of wonder where
we [insertion]she[/insertion] could have made her
entry, - rocks rose every
where around us.- [deletion][unclear]The[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]rocks were of granite[/deletion] We
soon landed & walked over
granite rocks to the town
of Mandals, by the side
of a fair river. - The idea
of Salmon fishing reanimated
us; I soon hired a boat

[page]264||dnp14j262pp|74393321[/page]
& we passed up the river. -
- The scenery about this river
is very peculiar; rocks rising
like islands out of the sand,
or really islands in the sea
from 100 to 600 feet high
& covered with wood, & so
numerous & so various in
their forms, colours & distri-
bution of masses as to be
very beautiful. The river
was of the size of the Tweed
before it joins the Tiviot &
has the reputation of affording
the best Salmon in Norway.
We rowed against the stream
the scenery constantly becoming
more beautiful. The woods
came down to the waters edge;
There were some cliffs but
no precipitous ones; the

[page]265||dnp14j263pp|74393322[/page]
263
banks were green slopes
the wood peculiar to England
& most of the flowers, - &
beautiful meadows close to
the water, which was very
transparent with a hue
in which amber predominated
but not peaty. The outline
was generally formed by
rocks some of which were
covered with pines in
the distance. I threw the
fly in vain for an hour
& then let it trail behind
the boat, where two or
three trout were taken
like the English small
trout. - We continued till
we were stopt by a
rapid where the rocks
came down close to the

[page]266||dnp14j264pp|74393323[/page]
river & where the scenery
was more wild & upon
a greater scale. - Here we
left the boat & walked about
a mile to the fall of the
Mandals river, which is
rather a rapid than a fall
a succession of foaming streams
& pool, where the water
leaps from rock to rock
from 4 to 10 feet &
over which Salmon easily
make their way. The narrow
channel through which the
river runs is very picturesque
& the birch trees grow close
to the fall as if out of
the granite rocks. The sun
was bright, yet I thought
myself sure of a salmon;
but my skill was vain

[page]267||dnp14j265pp|74393324[/page]
265
I saw two or three rise, & one
I believe at my fly; but
neither this day nor the
evening after had I any
success. - Next day, Lord
Clifton & I went to a
salt water lake or pond,
where we caught four
sea trout very good &
red, with artificial flies;
they rose very freely. Here
the scenery was exquisitely
beautiful; a succession of
arms of the sea, all like
inland lakes, full of
granite islands & surrounded
by high hills covered with
the richest kind of vegetation
& the rose, the woodbine, 
the Cornel tree & all
our English flowers, &

[page]268||dnp14j266pp|74393325[/page]
mountain ash & birch &
oak in profusion. Every
moment we opened upon
a new scene as we passed
by in our boat. We asked
if there was no fresh
water near, looking for
a stream which we might
fish. They carried us to
a spot where evidently
a torrent sometimes passed
& in less than 20 yards
we found ourselves on the
rocky brink of an inland
fresh water lake as beauti
ful as the upper lake of
Killarney & something like
it. Here we fished without
success, but we were re-
compensed by the agreeable
nature of the scenery which
was exquisitely beautiful

[page]269||dnp14j267pp|74393326[/page]
267
In addition to the other cloathing
of the rock, heather, juniper
the blueberry were in
abundance & the lake was
full at the borders of the
marsh beautiful water lilies"
"After spending four days
at Mandals, we left it
in the steam boat. We had a
little rough sea in going out of
the port; afterwards a delightful
voyage between rocks & islands
some bare & some wooded &
through channels sometimes not
so wide as our vessel was
long & in perfect calmness.
Here we saw the first sea
Eagle & many birds which
appeared Eider ducks & other
water fowl. We arrived in four
hours [deletion]in[/deletion] at Christiansand."
Consul Rienhard took me to
see the Torndale which empties
itself into the harbour of

[page]270||dnp14j268pp|74393327[/page]
Christian sand. The harbour
itself is a very fine one with
the peculiar Norwegian
features of rocky islands,
high granite crags.. more
or less covered with trees &
promontories generally topped
with firs. The quantity of
firs was greater on this
coast, than at Mandals &
the valley of the Torndale
displayed more fir wood than
wood of any other kind, yet
occasionally birch, alder &
oak appeared on the banks
& birch was not uncommon
The glen leading to the
Torridale was narrower
but the rocks on a grander
scale, than any thing we
had yet seen. The river itself
a fine majestic stream, as
large as the Rhone at Lyons

[page]271||dnp14j269pp|74393328[/page]
269
of a fine green colour & perfectly
transparent, presenting every
where along its banks the
unpicturesque riches of
No[deletion]w[/deletion]rway - the white stripped
& trimmed floating forests."
"We left Christiansand this
morning at 12 & at 4
found ourselves safely moored
in the harbour of Arendal.
We passed generally within
the rocks & I had the same kind
of scenery as our other voyages
from Mandals. - an immense
variety of little rocky islands
constantly opening [unclear]up[/unclear]; & some
times our channel seemed
hardly large enough for the
passage of the boat. The harbour
of Arendal is very beautiful
& the town most singularly
placed upon a rock with
rocks surrounding it & deep

[page]272||dnp14j270pp|74393329[/page]
water close to the houses. Trees
crown the rocks & neat little
houses come close to the waters
edge. I went immediately to
a beautiful wooded rock just
above the town, where the
Mandal scenery appeared
as if echoed upon the
river of Arendal I likewise
went to visit the iron mines
which are very curious in
sienite with all the [underline]rare[/underline]
[underline]specimens[/underline] well known to
mineralogists. One of the Mines
presents a very [deletion]curious[/deletion] fine
excavation & you look out
upon a tranquil little lake
with pastoral & wooded scenery
around it. The day after a
row to the fall of the river;
not so large as that of the
Torridale but with the same
features; the banks pastoral
the usual vegetation below

[page]273||dnp14j271pp|74393330[/page]
271
& pines above. When one branch
of the river enters the sea,
close to the fresh water, &
in what can scarcely be
called brackish water, myriads
of beautiful medusae were
to be seen; but none in the
absolutely fresh water. - After
dinner we walked to see
a most magnificent view
the sea on one side &
wood almost interminable
with lake & mountain on
the other, & a thousand little
fiords all surrounded
by wood. - "
" From the time we landed
in Norway till now, we have
had no night; the twilight
in the west is succeeded by
twilight in the East & at
midnight I could read the
smallest print. The Norwegian

[page]274||dnp14j272pp|74393331[/page]
rivers that we have hitherto
seen are all beautifully clear
& display their mountain
origin & their passage through
lakes; the tendency of colour
is green, but no peatiness;
nor have I yet seen any
river with that celestial
hue which characterises the
Rhone.
" Having no object in staying
at     - we left it
for Fredericshal at 2 o'clock
& going rather farther from
the coast passed along islands
of a larger size & saw
mountains of rather a higher
character in the Norwegian
land. We crossed the fiord of
Christiana without ever
losing sight of land & at
five found ourselves amongst
rocky islands, topped with pines
in the mouth of the Glommen

[page]275||dnp14j273pp|74393332[/page]
273
the largest river in Norway. The
masses of granite in these islands
are larger; the underwood &
flower bearing wood less &
the whole scenery ruder. The
stream rather whitish, but
not muddy, flowed rapidly
by the rocks, yet we moved
more rapidly against it &
soon anchored before Fredericshal
The fall of the Glommen
being only six English miles
off I ordered the Captain
to sail up the Stream to
it & we had a most
brilliant evening, dashing
through the rapids of this
immense river which I
think exceeds in size the
Danube at Vienna. The
banks were beautiful
but not wild, cornfields

[page]276||dnp14j274pp|74393333[/page]
wooded hills & some rocky cliffs.
We anchored at the termination
of the rapid in a rush of
whirlpool, close to the
shore & passed the night
on board. - It was amusing
to see the wonder of the
people who came out to
see this new phenomenon
of the steam boat going
against wind & tide &
who from their exclamations
probably took us for Lapland
wizards. - The fall of the
Glommen is a grand rush
of water not perpendicular,
but in it's descent does not
make less than 100 feet
of white water. It is the
grandest rush of water
I ever saw & after the
descent boils & foams for
half a mile. Salmon never

[page]277||dnp14j275pp|74393334[/page]
275
rise above it; boats have
sometimes been carried down
& dashed with their burdens
into pieces. From the top of
[place_364]the fall[/place_364] where the river is
perfectly still, beautifully
smooth & a quarter of a mile
at least in breadth, it is
a grand sight to see this
immense mass suddenly con-
verted into foam & white
wave, dashing with an
irresistable shock, & noise
like thunder over immense
masses of granite. Saw -
mills are here likewise,
but less offensive, from
the immense magnitude of
the river & fir trees seen
at the bottom are like
chips & straws in one of
our English [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] "

[page]278||dnp14j276pp|74393335[/page]
"We left the fall of the Glommen
at seven in the morning &
at 12 we were at Stronstadt.
The coast was wild; we
sailed between rocky islands
covered with wood, principally
pine, but sometimes oak &
birch. There was more of
grandeur in the outlines; but
not the same variety as in
Norway; but the same immense
masses of granite & the
same myriads of islands.
The day was dark & stormy &
harmonized well with the
scenery.
- - " I passed by some
small lakes, over some wild
heaths & at last came upon
me the white foam of the
[place_363]cataract of Trolhetta[/place_363]
like smoke. The river above
is a fine wide & tranquil

[page]279||dnp14j277pp|74393336[/page]
277
expanse. At first it is tortured
in it's fall by saw mills; but
at the second fall they
disappear. Here there is nothing
but the grand forms of Nature
the bold grand cliffs, 200 or
300 feet high, covered with
an almost infinite variety
of kinds of wood & capped by
gigantic pines. The water is
beautifully clear & the rapids
& falls for nearly half a
mile present a variety of
picturesque effect. Here a
deep whirlpool beneath a
fall 20 or 30 feet in height
& where the river is pressed
into the narrowest possible
channel. There a succession
of rapids & all white foam
& force & thunder "

The first extracts I shall

his illness, in which in
describing scenery he is
sometimes more elaborate
than he was afterwards, -
not I may remark of
scenery generally, but
of those parts of a country
which in travelling im-
pressed him most. - I shall
observe succession of time
in the [deletion]order[/deletion] arrangement
of the quotations - I
may briefly premise,
that in 1814-15, [person_656]he[/person_656]
twice passed through
the Tyrol into Italy; -
that in 1819 he made

[page]282||dnp14j280pp|74393339[/page]
a rapid fishing excursion
from Italy - through the same
mountainous region as far
as Layback & returned
to Italy; - & that in
1824 he visited [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]parts of[/deletion] Norway & Sweden
partly for the purpose of
making experiments on the
means [deletion]that[/deletion] he about that
time suggested for protecting
the copper sheathing of ships
from decay, & partly for
the amusement of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] seeing
countries & fishing in rivers
which were new to him.

with the grandeur & solemnity

March 30 - 1815 "I have again
passed through the Tyrol as
far as Botzin, where we
arrived at 1/2 past 3 this
day. We quitted Verona
yesterday morning & came on

road. The mountains all Lime
stone; & about a mile from
Roverido a scene of savage
wildness & desolation such
as I never before saw. The
valley of stones in Devonshire
is a miniature of it. The
Adige does not contain much
fish & rolls through meadows
with rows of mulberry trees.
The olive is little seen after
Roverido, but the vine the
tree of the country. The limestone

phenomena. - The rivers formd
by the melting of the snow

as if boiling. - Saw a

To the proceeding may be
added a sketch of [insertion]a speculative doctrine[/insertion] [deletion]doctrine[/deletion]
apparently written in 1827
called [underline]"The new theory of religion[/underline]
[underline]mind creative[/underline], the leading
idea of which [deletion]appears[/deletion] he
afterwards introduced in
an argument in the "Consolations"
"The energy of imagination
makes what was first [underline]idea[/underline]
more vivid continually till
it becomes as an [underline]insane[/underline]
persons [underline]Reality[/underline], when the
whole power of the mind
is devoted to one object.
So that the Gods of Greece
may be said to have existed
& the persons who believe
[underline]intensely[/underline] in different creeds
[underline]create[/underline] in their own minds
the results of the creeds: Then
the Christian religion may

[page]291||dnp14j289pp|74393348[/page]
289
be considered as [underline]ideal[/underline]. But
the heaven & the hell formed
by intense belief in the
human mind may be regarded
as real & even as [underline]adhering[/underline]
to the [underline]thinking[/underline] [underline]principle[/underline]
if any adheres after death.
So that all religions may
be absolutely false, but
virtually true for the
people that [underline]believe[/underline] [underline]them[/underline].
As we know nothing of the
Universe, but [underline]thought[/underline], why
should not the same generative
powers belong to [underline]thought[/underline]
which the physical Philosophers
ascribe to matter. -
The sum is the most perfect
emblem of infinite existence.
The [underline]rays[/underline] producing the image
change probably millions of
times in a minute; yet

[page]292||dnp14j290pp|74393349[/page]
the image & the source of
light are everlastingly
the same." -
This metaphysical speculation
may be liable to be misin
terpreted, I think it
might therefore have
make a few remarks on
it. - In the first place I
would oberve that it was
offered merely in a speculative
way & that the author of
it did not attach to it
any undue importance. -
or any notions incompatible
with the strongest religious [insertion]feeling[/insertion],
or belief in the truths of
the Christian Religion. -
His views of the nature &
power of the [deletion][unclear]human[/unclear][/deletion] human
mind were of a very

"My dear John,
If I had not

some experiments on the

take up the subject
both as a comparative
anatomist & Chemist
you are very capable

[page]307||dnp14j305pp|74393364[/page]

to elucidate. You will
see my paper on the
Torpedo in the manuscript
book which I have left
in Mr Tobin's hands. It
was my wish to have
imposed an unmagnetised
needle to the continued
shocks of a torpedo in
a metallic spiral,
making the metallic
communication perfect
with both electrical
organs. There is in my
little box an apparatus
for this purpose which
I hope you will use.
Large living Torpedos

[page]308||dnp14j306pp|74393365[/page]
may be procured at Fumicina
or Civitta Vecchia. The
shock from a very small
jar will make a needle
magnetic provided it
is entirely passed through
the metallic conductors,

was any with interruption

God bless you
my dear Brother
your affectionate

Humphry Davy.
Beneath he made an
an attempt to write &
did write "My dear John"
[insertion]but no more[/insertion]; his amanuensis wrote
the following P.S. [deletion]also[/deletion]
from his dictation

[page]310||dnp14j308pp|74393367[/page]
"I have written to you
but I fear you have
not yet the letter. I
have this moment received
your address. I am
dying - Come as quickly
as you can, you will
not see me alive I
am afraid
God bless you" -
as he supposed, I did not
get his first letter, [deletion]indeed[/deletion]
in time, indeed it
followed me to Geneva
where I found it [deletion]on[/deletion]
on our arrival from
Rome & I read it
only a few hours

[page]311||dnp14j309pp|74393368[/page]
309
before he expired - His
second letter, [deletion]which[/deletion]
[deletion]when he had my address[/deletion]
I was so fortunate as
to receive in a very
short time & I was
able to leave Malta
where I was then
stationed as physician
to the Forces, there on
four days after through
the kindness of Admiral
Sir Pultney Malcolm
who allowed me a
passage to Naples
in his [deletion]own[/deletion] Tender. -
The voyage was a

[page]312||dnp14j310pp|74393369[/page]
tedious one of six days
I landed at Naples on
the 14[superscript]th[/superscript] March; at 12 o'clock
at night I set out with
the courier & arrived
at Rome [deletion]at day break[/deletion]
early on the morning of
the 16[superscript]th[/superscript]. -
I shall [deletion]here[/deletion] now in con-
tinuance of my narration
make a description from
the Dialogues to their
author,- & give some
account of the time I
attended him at Rome -
[insertion]of[/insertion] our journey from Rome
to Geneva & of the
termination of his

[page]313||dnp14j311pp|74393370[/page]
311
earthly career in that
City. -
I shall not attempt to
describe [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]my[/insertion] feelings on
receiving the last letter
I have given, [deletion]expecting[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] of the illness[/deletion] making
known to me so [deletion]abruptly[/deletion]
suddenly & unexpectedly
the dangerous illness of
a Brother who had
acted the part of a
Father to me,- [deletion]of an[/deletion]
[deletion]only Brother,- of my[/deletion]
[deletion]best friend, & to whom[/deletion]
[deletion]I owed almost every[/deletion]
[deletion]thing I most valued in[/deletion]
[deletion]Life,[/deletion] & whom I regarded

[page]314||dnp14j312pp|74393371[/page]
as a Brother, a teacher
& most kind friend, &
to whom I necessarily
owed very much of
what I most valued
in my life. My anxiety
naturally increased [deletion]as[/deletion]
the nearer I came to
[deletion][unclear]him[/unclear][/deletion] Rome; in vain I
sought for fresh letters
or additional information
at Naples: - when I
entered Rome, I knew
not where to find him
for his address in that
City was not sent; I
in vain went from
our Hotel to another

[page]315||dnp14j313pp|74393372[/page]
313
making enquiries without
being able to hear any
thing of him - I fortunately
recollected that his
friend Morichini was
a Physician & a resident
in Rome, [deletion]& by sending[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]for him[/unclear][/deletion] he was easily
found & finally I
had a comfortable message
from him that my
Brother that morning
was rather better,
accompanied with a
direction to his lodging.
And in a few minutes
after I was by his bed
side - never shall I

[page]316||dnp14j314pp|74393373[/page]
forget the manner in which
he received, - me, - the
joy that lightened up
his pale & emaciated
countenance, - his cheerful
words & extreme kindness
& his endeavors to
sooth a grief which
I had not the power
of controlling [deletion]on finding[/deletion]
[deletion]him so ill [unclear]as I[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]had, but [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] [unclear]was tormented[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]as it was with tenderness[/deletion]
[deletion]on hearing him[/deletion] on finding
him so ill - or rather
on hearing him speak
as if a dying man, who
had only a few hours
to live & who wished

[page]317||dnp14j315pp|74393374[/page]
315
to use every moment of
such precious time. -
With a most cheerful
voice & [deletion]smiling[/deletion] a smile
on his countenance, - &
most warm pressure of
the hand, to bid me
not be grieved, - but
[deletion]become[/deletion] consider the
event as a Philosopher:
he [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] expressed his
pleasure at seeing me
soon & in having [deletion][unclear]his[/unclear][/deletion]
me with him in his
last hours, - & firmly
rejected all expectation
& hope of recovery -

[page]318||dnp14j316pp|74393375[/page]
He said, when he
experienced this attack
just as he had concluded
his Dialogues, [deletion]his[/deletion] he
was [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] sure his
career was run,- [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]
but tho' persuaded of
this, - he had [deletion]allowed[/deletion]
not rejected Medical
aid. - & had followed
the prescriptions of
his Physicians. - Now
I had arrived, he was
contented, & he began
immediately to [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
speak of [deletion]what was[/deletion]
[deletion]most interesting[/deletion] - those
things on which he

[page]319||dnp14j317pp|74393376[/page]
317
[unclear]wished[/unclear] to make me
acquainted with his
sentiments - a year &
half is now elapsed &
I write only from
recollection; - in the
notices I shall give
I shall endeavor to
be as accurate as I
can. - The subjects which
now interested him
most, - were the peculiar
electrical power &
anatomical structure
of the Torpedo, - the
subject of his last
letter to me, which I
have given, & on

[page]320||dnp14j318pp|74393377[/page]
which just before his
attack he was making
observations & prophecy
to make fresh exp[superscript]ts[/superscript].,-
his last dialogues &
the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] "second edition
of Salmonia - on
these subjects he
spoke fully, especialy
on the first & begged
that I would im mediate
ly take up the inquiry
& go next morning
to the fish market,
& procure some Torpedo
that with the fish
before us he might

[page]321||dnp14j319pp|74393378[/page]
319
point out what he
considered most deserving
of notice. - [deletion]Its[/deletion]
When my first agitation
had subsided & I had
leisure to make [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
enquiries into the
exact state of his
disease, - I took hope
though, when I expressed
my hopes, he shook his
head [deletion]with[/deletion] & with an
incredulous smile
said, it was useless
or something to that
effect - His symptoms
at this moment were
not at all alarming

[page]322||dnp14j320pp|74393379[/page]
the intellect was perfectly
clear; - the functions
were tolerably well
performed, - the pulse
not very rapid, - &
he has so far recovered
the power, of the
muscles of his limbs,
that with some aid
he could rise &
go into the sitting
room & that day
he rose & dined
in his room &
made a tolerable
dinner on some roast
chicken & spinage.

[page]323||dnp14j321pp|74393380[/page]
321
The greater part of the day
I sat by his bed side reading
the dialogues stopping occasion
ally to discuss particular
parts - His mind was
wonderfully cheerful & tranquil
& clear - & in a [deletion]most[/deletion] very
affectionate & most amiable
disposition, & the expression
of his countenance correspond
ed - He had lost all the
irritable feeling which
he was very liable to
before during his valitudinary
state & which was something
very distressing both to him
self & those around him
& which generally accom
panies paralytic complaints
His manner, his voice, the
expression of his countenance

[page]324||dnp14j322pp|74393381[/page]
the sentiments he expressed
his powers of argument all
gave me the idea, that
the intellectual organ /to
to use his own words ) in the
attack had [deletion]had[/deletion] escaped
[deletion]untouched[/deletion] unhurt. - It
was difficult to conceive
such power of mind
when the body was near
its dissolution: - Medically
it seemed incompatible
at the same time his
own conviction that he
was a dying man, con-
nected with the many
peculiarities of his
complaint & the tendency
there sometimes is to

[page]325||dnp14j323pp|74393382[/page]
323
believe [deletion]as[/deletion] easily what is
dreaded as well as what
is wished, - almost per-
suaded me that his [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]-
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] conviction of rapidly
approaching death founded
on internal feeling was
true - & that the
brilliancy of his mind
was "a lightening before
death." -
On the following morning,
I procured some Torpedos
from the fish market &
began an examination of
this curious fish, - which
I dissected in an adjoining
room & I [deletion][unclear]intended[/unclear][/deletion] was
[deletion]not[/deletion] employed alternately
in reading to him the

[page]326||dnp14j324pp|74393383[/page]
dialogues, - or when not
with him, as when he wished
to repose a little, in
carrying on my dissection
& occasionally showing
him the results - &
reading to him my notes
of them, all which not
merely amused him but
interested him deeply. -
Thus several days passed
his mind continuing [insertion]much[/insertion]
the same he gradually
became worse - he declined
the attendance of his
Physicians, [deletion]&[/deletion] excepting
 of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Morichini, whom
he saw as a friend; -
he would take no

[page]327||dnp14j325pp|74393384[/page]
325
medicine excepting the
acetate of Morphia, which
he used in large doses
& which had always the
temporary effect of relieving
[deletion]an[/deletion] [deletion]the[/deletion] uneasy sensations
& procuring sleep, &
aperient medicine [deletion]to[/deletion]
with the intention of
counter acting its' constipating
tendency. He gradually
grew worse & especially
when I had finished the
reading of the Dialogues
& he had spoken to the
concerning all the subjects
on which he wished to
express his sentiment. -
He appeared now to be

[page]328||dnp14j326pp|74393385[/page]
very much without motive
for exertion,- [deletion]as if he had[/deletion]
[deletion]acted his part & wanted[/deletion]
[deletion]rest,- as if all [unclear]stimuli[/unclear][/deletion]
& considered this the [unclear]exact[/unclear]
& appropriate time. for
his death. - His appetite
failed him, his bowels became
very constipated; there
was distressing [unclear]dysenemia[/unclear]
a very rapid pulse, -
profuse perspiration, -
a wandering of the mind
an awakening from sleep, -
& during sleep, a very
irregular respiration &
very slow & sometimes
spasmodic - He was at
The worst on the 31[superscript]st[/superscript] of

[page]329||dnp14j327pp|74393386[/page]
327
March - on that day his
pulse was amazingly
rapid more than 150
in frequency, & his re-
spirations at one time
were only five in the
minute: he would take
himself dying - as I did
who & often fearing
the day expected, that
he would breathe his
last. - Yet even, on
this day. - he now &
then rallied his powers,-
& his mind recovered
it's distinctness &
clearness & required
amusement - At his
no food & he believed

[page]330||dnp14j328pp|74393387[/page]

[page]331||dnp14j329pp|74393388[/page]
329

[page]332||dnp14j330pp|74393389[/page]
request I read to him,
about the first half
of M[superscript]r[/superscript] [unclear]Moore's[/unclear] Epicurean;-
the sad colouring &
melancholy sentiment
which pervades that
elegant little work
with the wildness of
some part of the fiction
& it's marvellous subter
raneous scenery &
incident amused him
much - At night he
would not allow me
to remain in his room
not even on a couch as
I had [insertion]done[/insertion] before; - he was sure
he should die that
night - he took leave

[page]333||dnp14j331pp|74393390[/page]
331
of me most tenderly - kissed
my cheek & bid God
bless me. - His mind was
perfectly tranquil; even
as much so, as on my
arrival - but his symptoms
were of a very different
character; - & witnessing
the sudden changes which
had taken place during
the day - I [deletion]fully expect[/deletion]
believed that now
indeed I was about to
lose him; - & that I
should never again
hear his voice of
kindness. - often during
the night, I went into
his room, - & heard

[page]334||dnp14j332pp|74393391[/page]
his breathing & the report
of his servant [insertion]who had a bed in his room[/insertion] when he
came to me once or
twice, [deletion]who had a bed[/deletion]
[deletion]in his room[/deletion] were not
unfavourable - The following
morning when I went
to him & drew back
his curtains, - he expressed
great astonishment at
being alive - he said
he had gone through
the whole process of
dying & that when he
awoke he had difficulty
in convincing himself
that he [insertion]was[/insertion] in his Earthly
existence; - & that he

[page]335||dnp14j333pp|74393392[/page]
333
was under the necessity
of making certain experi
ments to satisfy his
mind that he was
still in his body, as by
raising his hand &
with intercepting the light,
lifting the bed clothes
closing the eye lids &
He added, that his
being alive was quite
miraculous - & he now
began to think his
recovery not impossible
& [deletion]that he[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] might yet
be intended by Divine
Providence, that his
life should be

[page]336||dnp14j334pp|74393393[/page]
prolonged for purposes
of usefulness. - This
change of opinion in
regard to the possibility
of his own recovery,
gave me at the moment
almost the delight that
his recovery itself would
have done for I thought
it promised it & I
enjoyed I suppose the
pleasure in the anticipation
& at least in the
revival of hope at a
time when all hope
had ceased. The election
of a new [person_123]Pope[/person_123] the same
day [deletion]under[/deletion] who [deletion]assumed[/deletion]
took the name of
 Pius VIII, somehow

[page]337||dnp14j335pp|74393394[/page]
335
I think aided in re-
moving his former im
pressions of impending
death - Now, he was very
willing to follow any
course of Medical
treatment that I would
recommend & to be
guided in all things
by my advice as his
Physician & to consider
himself my patient.-
And, without loss of
time I prepared a
plan of treatment
which was instantly
embarked upon, - viz
The use of aperient
medicine, as seidlitz

[page]338||dnp14j336pp|74393395[/page]
[deletion]powder in solution,[/deletion]
[deletion]the carbonic acid[/deletion]
[deletion]having been allowed[/deletion]
[deletion]to escape combined[/deletion]
[deletion]with a little Sulphate[/deletion]
[deletion]of Quinine, acetate[/deletion]
[deletion]of morphia & white[/deletion]
[deletion]Hermitage.[/deletion]
combined with sulphate
of Quinine & acetate
of morphine & aided
by a tolerably nourishing
diet .-
From this day, he pretty
rapidly improved; all
the distressing symptoms
[deletion]subsided[/deletion] [insertion]diminished[/insertion] & in a few
days they had entirely
disappeared. - And a
change also had taken

[page]339||dnp14j337pp|74393396[/page]
337
place in the state of his
mind - now he was intent
on recovery, - he no longer
took the same deep interest
in my examination of
the Torpedo; as if he
looked forward to the
time when he should be
able to enter into the
investigation actively again
nor did the same kind
of reading altogether
interest him; - I remem-
ber on the day of his
revival, on my proposing
to review the story
of the Epicurean, he

[page]340||dnp14j338pp|74393397[/page]
objected to it & said
it was too melancholy -
He preferred Shakespear's
plays, especially his
[otherwork_122]comedys,[/otherwork_122] - & the Arabian
Nights & Humphrey Clinker
He delighted in hearing
them read - & he was
not comfortable unless
someone was with him
almost constantly during
the day reading to
him.. - When he had
begun to mend a little
& my hopes were strengthened
of his recovery Lady
Davy arrived from
England & brought with

[page]341||dnp14j339pp|74393398[/page]
339
her [deletion]too[/deletion] a copy of the
2[superscript]d[/superscript] Edition of Salmonia
which [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] gave him
very great pleasure: -
& with his usual
ardour, we began the
reading of it &
correction of it
immediately.- [deletion]He had[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]too much[/unclear] amusement[/deletion]
In a few days, he ex-
pressed a desire to go
out in the carriage.
The weather was delicious
during the whole of the
month of April - spring
weather I may say
really according to

[page]342||dnp14j340pp|74393399[/page]
the ideas of our poets -
the air balmy [deletion]& mild[/deletion]
"warmth without [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
heat & coolness without
cold" - the therm[superscript]r[/superscript]. seldom
above 70 & rarely
below 60, [deletion]a[/deletion] the rains
over, the sky clear,
of its' mildest blue
& the campagna green
of the freshest hue, -
the gardens & groves
bursting into foliage
& the distant mountains
of that dark blue,
which is almost
peculiar to Italy
& Greece, where the

[page]343||dnp14j341pp|74393400[/page]
341
sky is clear & [unclear]not[/unclear]
parched. - I look back
to this time with a
very great pleasure
& shall ever remember
these drives in the
neighborhood of Rome
with this feeling, [deletion][unclear]for[/unclear][/deletion]
To him, they were
particularly agreeable;
the soft cool breeze
refreshed him, - he
liked to expose him
self to it & especially
his fore head;- the
beautiful scenery, -
the simple appearance
of the beautiful

[page]344||dnp14j342pp|74393401[/page]
& environs of Rome
at this spring time, -
the season of life &
hope seemed to
exercise a restorative
power over him; - to
sooth & please &
[deletion]in[/deletion] give hope. - the
second day that we
went out, he took me
to the milky stream
of the [insertion]little[/insertion] Albula lake
which he has described
in the 3[superscript]d[/superscript] Dialogue of
the "consolations, in
travel, - that I might
have an opportunity
of [deletion][unclear]witnessing[/unclear] it's[/deletion]
[unclear]singular[/unclear]

[page]345||dnp14j343pp|74393402[/page]
343
of seeing its' singular
character - & whilst I
left him for this purpose
he got out of the
carriage & began to
practise himself in
walking & on my
return I found him
sitting on a stone on
the green flowery
turf & enjoying the
Campagna,- [deletion]there[/deletion] the most [insertion]fresh &[/insertion]
[deletion]verdant[/deletion] [insertion]green[/insertion] & beautifully
contrasted with the
adjourning wooded hills
Tivoli & the
few massive ruins
of ancient [deletion]works[/deletion] [insertion]buildings[/insertion]

[page]346||dnp14j344pp|74393403[/page]
appearing here & there
[deletion]in[/deletion] above the vast
expanse of verdance
another day we drove
into the Campagna [deletion]by[/deletion]
toward Albano, to
revisit that first of
all approaches to
Rome,- where every
object which meet the
eye is impressive as
relics of former times,
& the period of Rome's
greatest grandeur - the
colossal tombs by the
road side & scattered
over the plains, - the
artificial inequalities
of the surface, &

[page]347||dnp14j345pp|74393404[/page]
345
In tumuli, & most impressive
of all the vast aqueducts
running parallel towards
the city,- their [unclear]lines[/unclear]
[unclear]broken[/unclear] & their lofty
arches giving the idea
of enormous temples-
As was our custom we
got out at the end
of our drive & walked
a little way on the
Campagna for exercise,
& whilst we walked
conversed on the subject
of the extraordinary
scenery around us,-
so ancient, & yet, the
soil of volcanic sand,
& still glittering

[page]348||dnp14j346pp|74393405[/page]
with minute crystals
of volcanic origin,
mixed with fragments
of red brick & pottery;
& owing [deletion]to[/deletion] its' arid
[deletion]nature[/deletion] & silicious nature,
[deletion]character[/deletion] without calcarious
or aluminum Earth,
giving to this part of
the plain the character
of sterility. - But his
favourite & our most
frequent drive was on
the way to Civita"
Vecchia [deletion]towards [unclear]or[/unclear] as[/deletion]
[deletion]far as[/deletion] either close to
the Tibur or at a

[page]349||dnp14j347pp|74393406[/page]
347
little distance from the
course of the river thro'
the beautiful hilly region
which stretches in that
direction - a sucession
of gardens, vineyards &
orchards, - villas &
farm houses interspersed,-
the road lined with
trim hedge rows remind
ing me of [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]England[/insertion] - the
orchards in full bloom,
& the vineyards rapidly
sprouting & bursting
into leaf under the
influence of the [unclear]vine[/unclear]
[unclear]stem[/unclear] & air - [deletion]In[/deletion] This
part of the environs
influence of the various
influence of the various

[page]350||dnp14j348pp|74393407[/page]
used to be frequented
by him, when able to
amuse himself with his
gun & we generally
stopt at the distance
of four or five miles,
where between the
hills there is a little
open green plain in
pasture - & where a
sheltered hollow rich
in wild flower[unclear]s[/unclear] of
the spring - close to
the road was convenient
for making his attempt
at walking & for

[page]351||dnp14j349pp|74393408[/page]
349
sitting a little while in
the open air, [insertion]where[/insertion] the singing
of the sky lark & other
birds, - made it very
agreeable, - & he had
[unclear]manifest[/unclear] pleasure in
lingering [deletion]his[/deletion]. - Were
I to comply with my
feelings I should [deletion]be[/deletion]
indulge myself in
retracing in memory
all our other drives
in different directions
round this wonderful
city, - to the hilly
road beyond S[superscript]t[/superscript].
Peter's from where

[page]352||dnp14j350pp|74393409[/page]
the dome of that magnificent
church [insertion]looking down upon it[/insertion], is seen in
minute detail in
in all it's vastness;-
[deletion]Looking down upon[/deletion]
[deletion]it; - [/deletion] to the different
gardens, - in that
[unclear]princely[/unclear] style, of
[deletion]art[/deletion] grandeur of art
& rich [unclear][/unclear]
of nature, so happily
blended at Rome,
& no where else to
be seen in such
perfection; - & to
the great [unclear]ruins[/unclear]- 
of antiquity, [deletion]as if[/deletion]

[page]353||dnp14j351pp|74393410[/page]
351
which for magnitude
astonishes, & delights no
less now for picturesque
beauty; - to none, the
vine, the cypress &
the olive luxuriating
amidst their decay
especially on [place_616]the [deletion]p[/deletion]Palatine[/place_616]
where the guides are
gardeners & the richest
garden cultivation
is mingled with &
interrupted by raised
walls & fallen masses
& buildings in every
stage of decay. - After
the confinement of a
sick chamber,- after

[page]354||dnp14j352pp|74393411[/page]
the abandonment of hope
of recovery, to visit these
scenes & enjoy them with
my patient daily sensibly
improving was enjoyment
indeed; - [deletion]at[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion], the circumstances
& the occasion I suppose
gave this tinge of
feeling to every thing
around - & helped to
make an impression on
my mind which will
be durable always of
admiration of the scenery
& of its' wonderful
power of interesting beyond
all other scenes I ever
witnessed. - I must not
omit mentioning that as

[page]355||dnp14j353pp|74393412[/page]
353
he mended, the sentiment
of gratitude to Divine
Providence was overflowing,
& he was most amiable
& affectionate in manner.
He often inculcated the
property, in regard to
happenings, of the subjugation
of self in all selfishness,
as the very bane of
discomfort, & and the worst
active cause of dereliction
of social duties &
destination of good &
kindly feelings; - &
he impressed frequently

have quoted a passage of

appear to me unphilosophical

This distinct connection
