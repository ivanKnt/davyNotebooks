wading birds of the Tringa [deletion]species[/deletion]
Genus. -
In 1820 The migrating birds
were later & yet the winter
had been mild in southern
Italy: & there were very few
Ducks in the Pomptine Marshes.
probably there had been more rain
& snow than the year before.
There were some Petzardone
in the market in March but
though I beat the marshes at Rome
constantly from the 10 of March
I found no Pez[superscript]e[/superscript] till April
5 & that day after a Sirocco
the day before there came a
great flight I killed six
& Lord St Asaph who was
with me five more besides
common snipes at Maliana
