young reeves & ducks; but
no double snipes though the
ground appeared excellent
for them. they appear here
later, so that probably they
breed further north in the

& a few only [deletion]mar[/deletion] haunt
the coasts of the baltic.
That they do occasionally breed
there I think can hardly be
doubted. Even at Bremen a
sportsman assured me of this
& at Undeville in Sweden
another told me He had
found young ones not many
miles from the town that
could hardly fly. & that were so fat
that they burst in their fall.
