Here at Ravenna, the 14 & 15
of March when the Th. was at
60Â° or 58 in the evening
I saw bats flying about, the
first that have appeared since
Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] 31. when I saw them
In England on the Coast of

of torpidity & do they wake
for a day & then sleep again
this evening the thermometer was
below 54 & no bats made their
appearance. -
