22[superscript]d[/superscript] On the generation
of [underline]Eels[/underline] . Aal. E G. [underline]Anguilla[/underline] [unclear]xx[/unclear].
Notwithstanding Sir Everard Homes
paper [deletion]on this subject[/deletion] aided by
my own researches, I confess that
nothing satisfactory to me has
been written on the subject. Sir
Ev. is not a sufficiently minute
observer even aided by Bauer's
microscope to place full confidence
in his view of the organ of
generation, that the animal
is Hermaphrodite & selfimpregnating.
There is an excellent memoir
on the subject by Spallanzani
the last in the sixth V[superscript]o[/superscript] of his
Vigii nelle due Sicilie "Opuscoli
due sopra le Anguille. pag 194
& following published in 1797.
