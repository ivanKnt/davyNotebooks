Spellanzani & his friends seem to
have made an immense number
of observations on fresh water Eels.
He clearly confutes the opinion
that they are viviparous shewing
that what have been supposed
capillary eels are Vermes
belonging to the intestines & not
to the Uterus. - He [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] asserts
that Which Vallisneri believes
to the the ova are globules of fat
owing to a disease in certain eels
but thinks it possible that the
two sets of fringed bodies which
Vallisneri decribes adhering to the
interior of the spine may be the
ovaria & He finds another set
of small globules different from
the first. Malpeghi was of the
opinion of [person_453]Val.[person_453] that they are the
[deletion]of[/deletion] ovaria & I do not doubt it
