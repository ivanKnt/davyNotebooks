Spinal fringes, but no distinct ova
It would be well to examine
the chemical nature of these
fringes in Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] or Nov[superscript]r[/superscript].
& to see if they are gone
in [underline]Congers[/underline] [deletion]of[/deletion] in Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] & March
The young Eels must be born about
this time.
That all eels migrate
from the [underline]sea[/underline] there can be
no doubt & they seem to
be born in different years
at different times. in 1823 .
there were millions at the fall
at Ballyshannon in July.
In 1825 at the same season
there were hardly any, the first
was a cold the other a hot season.
Or is the [underline]fresh water[/underline] necessary
to the growth of the young eel
