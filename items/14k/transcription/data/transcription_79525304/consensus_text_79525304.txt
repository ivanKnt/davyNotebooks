when in the winter of 1821
in not very cold weather, I put
eels of different sizes into
salt water all the small
ones [underline]died[/underline]. & the only ones
one of six or seven that
lived was nearly 10 inches long
the death of the smaller ones
was / rapid in proportion
in they were smaller. yet
I have seen Eels of all
sizes in [underline]summer[/underline] in pools
in the sea shore; but [underline]never[/underline] I believe
in winter. - Is sea water a better
conductor of heat.
The fact mentioned by Sennebier
that there are Eels on the
lake of Neuchatel which
communicates with the Rhine
