23. The Boys in the marsh at
the Classe said they had seen
a Pizardone, I found & shot two
jacks & then even a few snipes
24. This day I dissected
a Spigola. I could see no
distinct milt, so as to
be convinced of its double sex
the ovaria were [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] very
small, loose bags & it of course
was yet in an immature state
it was said to be a pound & a half. -
[underline]Johnstone[/underline] says the Schill is found
in Ambronis lacu Bavariae
I went into the marshes, there
there were very few snipes; I saw a
flock (I believe) of Ruff - reeves.
I killed three snipes
