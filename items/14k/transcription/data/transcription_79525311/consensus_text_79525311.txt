Examined this day March 30
A spigola Perca Marina weighing
3/4 of a pound. there appeared a
mass like milt & the two ovaria
but on boiling the fish the milt
turned out to be [underline]fat[/underline], the ovaria
were exceedingly small so that this
fish probably does not spawn till
till late in the summer. I was much
struck by the general resemblance
to the perch. -

Examined the two Galinates of the
same kind as the spotted one of England
one considerably smaller than the
other 1/3 - a darker breast, but the
same colour [insertion]back & wings[/insertion] with black & white spots
the largest on had [underline]more fawn[/underline] coloured
feathers under the tail, [underline]both females[/underline]
Examined Two jacks but could find
no difference except in fatness. [underline]females[/underline]
The two rails must be of different [underline]species[/underline]
