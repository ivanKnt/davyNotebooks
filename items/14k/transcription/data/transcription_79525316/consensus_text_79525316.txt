Gorizia April 25. - The country
beautiful in the first part -
of the year; quite a garden
cultivation round Gradisca & Gorizia
a good mode of cultivating the
vine by training it from
one pollard cherry tree [deletion]to[/deletion]
another, the cherries are so cut
that a few perpendicular shoots
for fruit remain thus
[ink sketch perhaps of pollarded cherry trees in Gradisca or Gorizia]
which can not shade the vines
The Isonzo of a beautiful
pale azure with a slight
milkiness. I could see no fish
This river in appearance like
those of Pordenone & Sacile.
& evidently frm a subterranean
source. - & rising in limestone.
