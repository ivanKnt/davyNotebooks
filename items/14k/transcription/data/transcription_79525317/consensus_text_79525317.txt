19 Laybach 18
Ascertained by disagreable experience
that rivers which rise from limestone
rocks are not always clear.
The Wipaco which on Monday was
beautifully clear though large became
after the hard rain of a night
milky & [insertion][deletion]16[/deletion]17[/insertion] I could not raise a
fish [insertion]the [deletion]16[/deletion][/insertion] & they say it will be
two or three days before it is
clear again. 19[superscript]th[/superscript] I saw a large
stream yeasterday close to Ober Laybach
which rose blue blue but milky
one of the sources of the [deletion]Villach[/deletion] Laybach
river which is now very large &
which they say contains huchos.
- This day the 19 went into the
marshes & found two double snipes
& some common snipes & a quail & a
[insertion]rail[/insertion] I shot one or two snipes - but my
[unclear]Sir[/unclear] James [unclear]Tillers[/unclear] shot prevented
me from getting a shot at the
pizardone quails or rail
