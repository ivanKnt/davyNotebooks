flocks of birds that I suppose
were tringos got a long shot
at four teal & missed them
The chasseur killed four jacks
but we found no more Chokitti
This morning got a small
HUCO. 13 inches long by
six in circumference. very
white belly [underline]yellow fins[/underline] below very
like a [insertion]sea[/insertion] trout in colour but only
black spots, I could see however
none on the fins, [underline]very thick[/underline]
but narrow large teeth small
head, less calculated for leaping
than the trout, but the fleshy fin
much larger than in any of
the salmo genus I have seen
opened it, ovaria little developed
I conclude it could not breed this
season probably a fish of last year
