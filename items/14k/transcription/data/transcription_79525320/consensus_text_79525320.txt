Lubiana. April 22.
Went over the wet meadows
this morning but found no
Joketti. I shot three snipes
a quail & a small spotted
male quail. There were many
male rail. There were many
flocks of birds of the Tringa
kind: but all shy.
The snipe breeds here, but
not the Jokette. I saw
the 20 a small flock of teal
rather tame & fired at them
but missed. -
The weather here has been constantly
cloudy but cool & agreable
at least to my feelings - thermo .
at 1/2 past 7 in the evening 58 . or 59.-
