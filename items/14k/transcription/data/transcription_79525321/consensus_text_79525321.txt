April 24 - Yesterday went to
the Save which on the 22 was
small & blue, this day it was
at least ten times as large
+ & quite foul like the Drave
in summer went on to two
small streams on the Vienza road
one was too small the other
too foul for fishing -
This day 24 went into the
marshes in the Boat. found one
Joketti which I killed a fine
large one, which my chasseur says
is a female & He says the male
is smaller & [deletion]paler[/deletion] [insertion]darker[/insertion]. found a
quail which I likewise winged &
now keep alive to observe its habits 
Found some Jacks here called "pukeron".
