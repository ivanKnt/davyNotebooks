yesterday & Thursday dined on
[underline]river carp[/underline] - exceedingly good plain
boiled. see next page for
the conclusion of the test
28. There are no Eels in
any of [underline]these rivers[/underline] that communicate
with the Danube. at least so
says Peppina,
thermometer 58.
My Chasseur says so likewise
the Eels I saw there in the
market came from Trieste.
There are no eels in
the [unclear]Chernetze[/unclear] see. or in any of these rivers
Is this owing to a want of
the [unclear]Conger[/unclear] in the black sea
or to some great fall of
the Danube which they cannot pass?
