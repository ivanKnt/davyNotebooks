missed with both barrels to a
hedge which though raised twice
He did not quit & I shot
her through a willow tree
in which she rose. I have as
yet heard no quail sing.
The Chapla or grey bittern I
have skinned. He is rather fat
& has a quantity of down under
the pattern on the breast.
I saw several longer & larger birds
& fired at one at a distance
they are very like bitterns in
colour & are here called [underline]Ranga[/underline]
not so tame as the [underline]Cholla[/underline].
Got another small [underline]Huco[/underline] of
the size of the last It had no spots
black [insertion]or red[/insertion] [deletion]spots[/deletion] on any of the fins
the belly was silvery white was said
to be from the Sava -
I shall eat it for [underline]dinner[/underline] -
