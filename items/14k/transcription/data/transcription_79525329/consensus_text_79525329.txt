& the bold & snow clad mountains
of Carniola & Carinthia beyond.
the water beautifully clear & blue
saw great quantities of fish
shewing themselves in the water
with bright sides. called here
breet fish, or bred fish Qu the 
Ida Carp. ? -
+ They said there were hucho,
grayling & trout: but I
caught nothing & from the
quantity of coarse fish, I doubt
if it is ever a good fishing
spot: but the day was as bright
as the river, sun without
a cloud. & I was at the spot
in the worst time of the day
between 1 & 3, saw a very few
flies like the granam
but there was no rise of fish. -
