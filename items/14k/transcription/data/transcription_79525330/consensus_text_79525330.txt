April 30. The thermometer at 1/2
past 8 is 59° in my room.-
& another beautiful day.
at 1/2 past 6 PM it is as 62°
the highest I have yet seen it here
Went to the fall of the Lubiana
& caught nothing but [unclear]cheits[/unclear] saw
a fish rise at the small
fry which I suppose was
a Huco; but I could not

The views were extremely
beautiful & the mountains
appear in the red round
the Keltebrun or fall
rivalling those of Switzerland
in grandeur, the whole scene
abounding in beauty.
& caught nothing but [unclear]just [/unclear]saw
