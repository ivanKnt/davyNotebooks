Male Quail & female Pizardone
to be eaten this day. Pizardone very fat
& good female. Quail fat & good Whilst not
developed as large as beans kidney.
There may be accidental differences
in birds, but these two sets appear
to be little difference in fatness.
The Male Pizardone, & even the
male quails cannot yet be exhausted
by the sexual intercourse
Yet a male Quail, I got last
week was much fatter, probably
from having fed & rested before
the pairing time, the Quails are
now many of them paired.
The true time for this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
will be in the Autumn.

[underline]the great pizardone[/underline]
This female pizardone appeared the largest I have
seen this year; but smaller than some I killed
in Italy 8 or 9 years ago.
