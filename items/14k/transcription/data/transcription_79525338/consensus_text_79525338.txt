the day was cloudy till 2 oClock
& though I tried all kinds of
baits, [underline]roach[/underline] [underline]bleak[/underline] & [underline]chub[/underline]
by spinning, & alive, I could
not raise a fish. What
can be the reason of this ?
I saw a Huco [insertion]Quere was it not a grayling? rise two or
three times & I tried the fly
& a small bleak in the spot
but entirely without success
From the quantity of the fish
[deletion]I think it[/deletion] & the variety of
sizes from 30 lb to 3 oz
I think it must be a
Danube trout probably originally
of the black sea; but I got
a small one in the market
which must have wintered
in the river about 10 inches
