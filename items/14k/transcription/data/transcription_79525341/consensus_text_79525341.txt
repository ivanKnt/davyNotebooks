stream called Kleingraben
where I caught a grayling
with a fly & a Hucho with
a small fish, the Hucho
was about a pound & of the
same character as the last
with black spots a white belly
& very narrow compared to its
length about the scale of 6 to
13 but thick
D. 11. Pectoral 15. Ventral 10
Anal 11. Caudal 20 or 21
Anal 11. Caudal 20 or 21.
The Hucos in this little stream
have probably less food than in
the Laybach river, for I hooked
a small one with a fly: but He
escaped. & I hooked another larger
one probably more than 2 lb who
likewise escaped with a small fish
