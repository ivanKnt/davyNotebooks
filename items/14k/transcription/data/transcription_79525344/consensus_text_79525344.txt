day what [unclear]xxx[/unclear] went in
the morning to the Kleinegreben
where I was yesterday hooked
the same large Huco which I think
was above 4 lb - He rose
at the bleak like a pike
but I lost him by one of
the small hooks breaking.
raised another small one about
10 inches long: but did not
hook him.
Went up to the mountains
through which the river runs
but saw no Hucos there
I caught three Graylings with the
fly [insertion]one with red hackle & peacock body[/insertion], two of them took in the
rain the blue dun yellow body. -
There seemed to be no trout.
but plenty of coarse fish, chub dace & roach
