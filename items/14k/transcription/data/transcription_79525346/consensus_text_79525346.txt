Observed the difference [underline]between[/underline]

the rain, the rain poured in
torrents from the slate: but
less violently from the thatch
but the thatch [underline]continued dripping[/underline]
when the slate was [underline]quite dry[/underline].
This offers a good analogy
to drained, or rocky or
cultivated countries, & boggy
or wild countries. -
The rivers in one case are
rapid & soon exhausted torrents

other nearer perennial &
equable streams. -
