behaved well & the Rails though
they ran hard even most of
them raised.
These meadows seem excellent
for them, there is much
water. they are now too
grassy for Joketti: but
the short grass forms the
haunt of the Quails & the
+ long grass of the Rails.

It would seem as if
all the migratory animals
move onward till they
find their proper places.
Just common snipes come
here, then when the grass
is too long for them Joketti
& the rails; The Jacks breed
in the marsh And no other
birds except plovers haunt
The Male rail has a longer
body & a darker Breast
more of blue feathers. -
