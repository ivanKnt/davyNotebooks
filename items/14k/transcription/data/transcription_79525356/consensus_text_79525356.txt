Had good sport shot 11 rails
& 15 1. & a small heron not
much larger than a rail. [deletion]one[/deletion] This bird
ran like a rail & was raised with difficulty & [insertion]found with great difficulty after having been winged[/insertion]
of the Ranga kind with brown body
& like the great Ranga. shot
likewise a peculiar kind of
the [unclear]xxxx xxxxx[/unclear] kind. - 14 head.
The rails now in great abundance
