Went to the Kleinegraben
high up. Nine or ten miles
& as I predicted found no Huchos
& killed only Chub which
took the bleak; - the Hucos
coming from the large rivers
can not pass so many mill
falls. - Went to the place
where I caught my Huco before
& there saw his run at the
small fish both of which I
took by spinning the bleak
1. . I think was a lb & 3/4 the
other about 2 1/2. This last
had a few black spots at the
base of the back fin; but
other fin not spotted, both fish
had only black spots. the smallest
had a silvery belly; but plenty
of river leeches adhering to his sides
& tail so that He was probably
newly run from the dead water
