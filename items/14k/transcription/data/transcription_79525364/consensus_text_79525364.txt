that of 5 Hucos that run
at the bleck four refused
it. the fifth I took in
the pool where I have [insertion]taken[/insertion] so many
- a clear stream with a deep
pool & a long [unclear]tail[/unclear] & a
run for small fish where
the Hucos feed.
Caught also one [deletion]Grayling[/deletion]
Ash. the Hucos refused the
bleak but whether from seeing
me or the hooks & line
I know not, yet one was
far off. the others might have
seen me as I saw them.
This Huco I caught today had
several leeches - three or four on
the tail.
