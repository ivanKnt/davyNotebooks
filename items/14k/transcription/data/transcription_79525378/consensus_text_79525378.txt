In my window at 9. thermometer
55Â°. after a beautiful day
in the room on table 58.
From the similarity of the Char
of the Leopoldsteiner Lake &
the Ombre Chev[superscript]r[/superscript] of the lake of
Borguet; I am induced to make
some observations on the physical
causes. which by changing the
X habits [insertion]in many generations[/insertion] may change the forms of
fish. - The Trout when
it feeds [insertion]principally[/insertion] on [underline]fish[/underline] must be [underline]extremely[/underline]
active & strong & from its predatory &
mobile habits acquires large teeth
large fleshy fins, thick skin &
great pectoral fins for turning.
When it feeds on shell fish
it gains the stomach of the char
& its colours - as in the Gillaroo
trout & the Char when it
becomes large is extremely like if
