not the same with the Ombre Chevalier.
The colour likewise varies with the
water in the clear water coming
from this lake & the Koenig see
the Trout are beautifully colored [insertion]probably from the influence of the light[/insertion]
Silvery white with bright vermilion
spots. I have seen the same
differences in Cornwall [insertion]at[/insertion] Castle a Denis
which are continued by generative impressions
two streams one from a moor, yellow
[insertion]ish brown[/insertion] producing black & yellow trout
one clear with a sandy bottom producing
white with red spots . _ There are
in the [deletion]Koenig[/deletion] [insertion]Leopoldstein[/insertion] see [underline]Lachs forelle[/underline], 18[superscript][unclear]lbs[/unclear][/superscript]
[insertion]& more[/insertion] or large trout with silvery bellies
& red [insertion]flesh[/insertion]. are these great char or
trout like those of the Lago di Garda.
The habits of spawning of fish must
be influenced by weather, the Char I got
[deletion]caught[/deletion] this morning with mature
eggs was just about to spawn. -
yet in England they spawn in winter. -
