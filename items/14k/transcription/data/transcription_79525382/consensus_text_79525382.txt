May 31. Eisenhartz, another beautiful day
Thermometer at 4 in window 54 at 8 60
in room at 1/2 past 8 60. - bright
blue sky, & the swallows soaring high
but not higher than yesternight in the
storm, when the red light of evening
shining upon [deletion]a moist covers[/deletion] the rain
[deletion]&[/deletion] clouding a mountain & a broken
+
rainbow gave a peculiar character
to the view. one great peak in sunshine
others black from clouds & [underline]reflected[/underline]
shadow. -
Went to the waterfall by the mountain
road, views very fine & ascent & descent
tremendous, saw none of the Alpine animals
though there are said to be
many chamois & great gras.
returned to the river & fished for
a half an hour & caught with
the black fly three trout, exactly
like the brown trout of England, & its island
& Norway, - The day not so hot
to my feelings as yesterday more
wind, the Thermometer under 65 at
five in my room. - The largest trout
