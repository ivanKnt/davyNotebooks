At 11 Thermometer at 65° in
the window in my room, the
views very beautiful; but alass
I cannot enjoy them, Though
weak by evacuations I have
a headache, & I fear some
congestion of blood in the brain
yet. I have fasted & kept up
+ constant excitement on the
nape of the neck by Acetic acid
& I have applied since - I wrote
3 leeches to the temples & behind
the ear. Therm. 67°. -
There are stags Roes & Chamois
surrounding this secluded spot
& for a strong & youthful Lover
of the Chace & of Nature it
would be a delightful residence
