feels hot & oppressive
I went in the morning
to the Grundel see &
Hooked in the great
pool where the river
escapes one large fish
with the [unclear]hilidene[/unclear] & another
with the artificial minnow
but both got off: There
was no rise in the lake
I hooked one good fish with fly.
in the tail of the lake
& rose one or two others
but heavy rain came on
& I gave up fishing: Got
a char caught yesterday killed
[insertion]an hour before dinner[/insertion] which though the flesh was
white was full of curd
