bright sunshiny day went to
Alt Ausee a beautiful Alpine
lake; but could see no
trout worth taking, as the
fishery belongs to the peasants
the Inceberg bounds the view
on the Halstadt side; returned
at 12 oClock.
at 2 hottest time of the day by
shuting the jalousies. in room T.60.-
Ascertained that the fly which
I have often seen in these vallies
& which sports in the sun
with four wings looking almost
like a moth is a water fly
& very like the stone fly of
England, flat body very thin &
hairs in the tail
[underline]size[/underline] [underline]larger[/underline]
