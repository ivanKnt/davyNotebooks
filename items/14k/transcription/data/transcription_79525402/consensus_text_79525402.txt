The Traun of a beautiful green
rather paler than the Rhine
It is now very large; but clear.
A beautiful but very warm
evening at 1/2 past 9 the thermometer
in my room 69Â°. -
Fished in the river; but water
is too high though so clear
saw no fish rise. In a
little branch of the Ischel
running through the town
caught 3 inch trout & one
Grayling . - . returned at 1/4 past
nine.
15 left Ischel, a thunder
storm at 5 in the morning
had fallen & sent the roads
into the Traun which was
quite foul between Ischel
& Avensee where it enters
the Traunsee. took boat
