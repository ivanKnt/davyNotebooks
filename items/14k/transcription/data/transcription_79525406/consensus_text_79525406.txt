At [deletion]1/2 past[/deletion] five in window hard
rain after thunder at 65.
at 1/2 past five 67. at 1/2 past
6. 65
Went to the bridge caught
two silvery small trout like
sea trout (which the fisherman
says were lake trout) with
green backs [insertion]& only black spots[/insertion] & one large grayling
[unclear]so none[/unclear] of fish hooked are other
large grayling - I now
doubt if the fish I took
nine years ago was not one
of these trout, & not a huco
for in colour they are exactly
like Huche but differ in
shape. - rain till 1/2 past
7 & a dull night; but a rainbow
T in the window 63. -
