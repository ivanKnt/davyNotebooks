Caught 2 common trout very silvery
but with red spots, - & 2 large
grayling one nearly 2 lb -
in all 11 fish. - Ther at 1/2 past
3. 68 in room.
I have seen few finer fishing
incidents than the one of this day
the large trout who was lying
at the edge of the foam of the
fall rose at the fly & was slightly
hooked only. I changed the fly &
put on a larger one. & He took
immediately & dashed away into
the rapid water. where He sprang
high in the air. He then went
to the bottom & I unwisely suffered
him to run supposing He would go
down the fall instead of which
He ran to the bank & there
felt his strength & broke a slender
stretching line. Went at at 10 returned
at 3.-
Eat these fishes Lachs forelle cream colored.
