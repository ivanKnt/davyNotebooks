back fin like a herring. -
Till 1/2 past eleven bright sun
when a thunder storm without
heavy rain came on & the
sky continued overcast. Went below
the bridge & raised only 1 small
trout went to the mill where
I hooked & lost two trout that appeared
to me large at least more than 1 lb.-
Took with a large fly grouse hackle
& orange body 4 smaller trout of which
3 had the characters of Lachs forelle
ie they had only black spots & were
of a silvery whiteness. below. -
I am not sure that the Rheinvelle
is the [underline]Ferra.[/underline] at least the spines on
the fin do not correspond. but I did not
count them with the care required
to establish the species, the Dorsal I think
cannot be more than 13. -
It is if not the [underline]same[/underline] fish [unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear]. -
Eat one of the [underline]Trout[/underline] caught this day
which was good curdly & cream colored. _
the Rheinvall or Rheinachen eat well but
rather too much like a dace -
