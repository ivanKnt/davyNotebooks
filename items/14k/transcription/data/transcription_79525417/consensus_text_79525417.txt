The grayling I think are yellower in
the Ager than in the Voecla, a
proof that their colour is not occasioned
by the colour of the water - though probably
by its extreme purity which gives more
power to [underline]light[/underline]. Went to the
Bridge over the Agger about 1/2 a mile
from the town. Caught a number
of Graylings two very fine over 1. 1/2 lb
+ Was soon satiated with sport &
changed my tackle with the hope
of catching a Huco - put on a
roach & soon caught a fish
which to my surprise was an
excellent pike of 2 lb & which
I ate for dinner - Had two or
three other runs which I think
were from large chub as the
[underline]fish[/underline] were not torn by teeth
& hooked one other small pike who
got off. - Took my Grayling
with large flies, principally red hackle
