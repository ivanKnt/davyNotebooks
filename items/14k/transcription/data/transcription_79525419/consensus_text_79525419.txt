24 T. at 7 64 in room a beautiful
morning, fresh, came on to Kammer
& fished till 1/2 past 2 from 11
had excellent sport caught a number
of great Grayling from 1 to 2 lb.
I measured 1 which I think was
the largest 15 inches & 1/2 German by
8 1/4, caught one trout likewise.
The Ager is beautifully clear & blue
& it is impossible to have
finer flys [insertion]fis[/insertion]hing; but it is almost
satiating from its perfection & from
there being no difficulty of any
kind except what arises from my
weak state of health. -
