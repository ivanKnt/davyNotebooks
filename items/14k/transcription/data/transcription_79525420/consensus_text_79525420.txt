At 3 Ther in room 64. Returned
from a loitering day in which
I caught some grayling & coarse
fish Chub & a large bleck
almost as large as a herring.
but fished without much energy
& chiefly experimentaly with salmon
& large lake flies with which I caught
grayling - day warmer than yesterday
& very fine, the Ager I think somewhat
smaller; but now 4 times as large as the
Avon. & [insertion]amongst[/insertion] the clearest streams I ever saw
as clear as the Lathkill or Traun. -
The charges here copied from Voeclabruck
per day 4..[superscript]f[/superscript]30. Had yesterday & today
Grayling fried excellent, I think they have
more curd & are fatter than the english
fish, they are certainly much yellower.
Went out again at six a beautiful
evening for fishing, calm had excellent
sport caught ten or twelve great Graylings
from 2 lb to 1 lb - which I saw rise
at the fly. Ther[superscript]r[/superscript]. in room 62.
