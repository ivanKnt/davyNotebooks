It turned out a rainy morning. I went
however to the river, & caught principaly
with the Mayfly a number of
small trouts I should think 40
& four large Grayling, Two I
measured more than 15 inches long
I should quess them 1 lb 3/4
1 grayling with the Mayfly
3 of the grayling with the blue
dun. - T. at 60 in room at
4 in window the same. T.59.
A beautiful evening, the mountains
illuminated above the lake
by an unseen sun & the
western sky in a blaze of
vermilion; [underline]light[/underline] so bright
succeeded by almost absolute
darkness. - My evening walk
was to the hill above the
lake from which the views are
very beautiful. -
