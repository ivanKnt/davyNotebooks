Being in the neighborhood of
Geneva in the beginning of
Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] I was anxious to gain
information respecting & to
examine this fish. My Courier
[unclear]Borilly[/unclear] was well acquainted with
it being from the neighborhood
of Lausanne. He described it
as a fish of prey caught
generally in the winter months
& at that time not uncommon
in the part of the lake near
Vevay, biting at small fish

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00004|dnp14k002pp|79525280[/page]
& taken both by hook &
net. - At Lyons I
could find none, they were
said to be too dear to
be in the market this
 year: but at Chambery
I found they were not
uncommon being brought not
from the lake of Geneva but
from that of Barquet 4
miles off. There had been
some in the market the
day I arrived & the day
after my courier bought one,
Which He said weighed
a pound & a half for 4 francs
& a half probably double its

price as it was a second sale
bought from a Restaurateur.
This was Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] 11. - It was of
a beautiful silver whiteness,
not unlike a whiting, or [unclear]Whilling[/unclear]
in brilliancy, the scales very
small, the form exceedingly like
that of a char. & the light
greyish green of its back very
similar to that of the char.
It was 15 inches long & 7 1/2 in
circumference thickest part.
There were 20 spots on the
body: & a few large cloudy
spots on the fins. Those on
the dorsal fin being blue grey.
The anal fin was yellow with
a shade of pink. The
pectoral were reddish brown, &

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00006|dnp14k004pp|79525282[/page]
there was a slight tint of pink
at the origin of the tail
It was exactly like a char,

silvery white.

The fish is evidently congenerous
with the char. I am not sure
that I have not seen it in
England*. Its teeth are numerous
& large for its size & it
is usually friend of a cool
x [unclear]Shaw[/unclear] fish from Windermere

water. It is said to be
found only in the lakes of
Neuchatel & Geneva. How true
this is my notes tell.
It will be probably be found
in other lakes amongst the
Alps which are deep
& similar in bottom to
these of Barquet & Geneva. -
- Blocks figure of the fish
is not bad; though He has
not given the colours of the
fins. -
I cut it for dinner 11[superscript]th[/superscript]. It was
excellent the flesh approaching to
cream or cheeze colour. The taste
like that of a char. It was
fat and delicate in flavour and
one of the best fishes I have
ever tasted. -
The stomach very thick.

first I ever saw [insertion]alive[/insertion] was in the
[unclear]Maremsie[/unclear] near Venice in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript]
1818. It rose under my feet
& flew like a quail straight forward
shewing white feathers in its tail

about the [deletion]first[/deletion] [insertion]third[/insertion] week in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript].-
I have every reason to believe they
are very rare in this season
in Italy & they are never seen
here in winter. A person at
Ravenna told me they were
sometimes found as late as Oct[superscript]r[/superscript]
but very seldom. The spring
is the great [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xx[/unclear][/deletion] season of
their migration through Italy
from probably the 15 [superscript]th[/superscript] of March
till the middle of April.
& sometimes later. -
In the spring of 1819 I killed
one the 19 of March at [unclear]maliana[/unclear]

But the place where I had the

10 or 12 R at 8 in the morning
& did not rise in the day to
more than 13 or 14. - The grass
in the meadows is generally
high & beautifully green with
a quantity of moss. but I found
them likewise in coarser rushy

water. -

In 1820 The migrating birds

probably there had been more rain
& snow than the year before.
There were some Pizardone
in the market in March but
though I beat the marshes at Rome
constantly from the 10 of March
I found no Piz[superscript]e[/superscript] till April
5 & that day after a Sirocco
the day before there came a
great flight I killed six
& Lord St Asaph who was
with me five more besides
common snipes at Maliana

The 7 I killed 12 Pizardone
9 common snipes & 4 rails
The 9 I found a great many
but it was a wet day
& I shot it best in the
great marsh at Maliana
I killed thrice or four.
I believe 7 altogether! but doubtful
The 11 or 12 I left Rome
for Col fiorito - I found
this year the lakes full
of water. Snow still on
the sides of the hills
& no cover for the
birds, the grass on the
sides of the lakes was so
low that the double snipes

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00016|# RI MS HD_14_k_14.tif|[/page]
could not hide themselves
I found two Piz[superscript]e[/superscript] on the
banks of the upper lake
walking about & I shot one
of them. I shot one or
two more but I had no
sport; there was no cover
for the birds.
I came to Ravenna about
the 19 & found one Piz[superscript]e[/superscript]
on the edge of the marsh
near [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]Cernia[/insertion] but none at
Ravenna & [unclear]1 token[/unclear] try

this & Ruff & [unclear]secour[/unclear]
& a few common snipes.
I found a Plover nest (Lapwing)
with four eggs; but shot little
or nothing.
[underline]14 th[/underline] The pizardone are easily shot when
they first rise & seldom make
a long flight but after being
raised two or three times they
[unclear]run[/unclear] & afterwards often fly
to the nearest wood. They lie
very close the first time they are
found. The smallest [unclear]animal[/unclear] which
I suppose to be the male has darker
legs. & I found in one a little
red behind the ear. The organs
of hearing are very large & they
[unclear]nicely began[/unclear] I ran when they
hear & [unclear]move[/unclear] so that nothing
so much [unclear]contributes[/unclear] to [unclear]sport[/unclear]
here probable the marsh had been hint
by a dozen sportsmen before me & that the birds
had been killed.

sport as talking or calling to
the dogs - They differ from
the common snipe in having
a shorter beak in weighing nearly
twice as much in having a
spotted red a white breast
& in spring all have white
feathers in the tail.
Being in Sweden Norway &
Denmark in the summer of
1824 - I enquired into the
habits of the same bird. The
accounts of all Sportsmen are
that they breed in these countries
I saw a nest of eggs of one
in Denmark [deletion]& young[/deletion] in the
museum & the 8 or 9 of
Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] one was sent me by
Count Blucher of Altona who

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00019|dnp14k017pp|79525293[/page]
17
said his Sportsmen had killed
five or six. It was very fat
& I should think a young one
it was exactly like the spring
bird of Italy except that it
had no [underline]white[/underline] feathers on the
tail. On the twelfth of
Augt I went to the marshes
where these birds are said
to be found. I found one but
it was a very wet day, a flood of rain
it was very wild & had no
white feathers on the tail I did
not get a shot at it - it was
in the same kind of long rushy
grass in which they haunt in
Italy & probably in the
African rivers. At
Gottenburgh in the beginning
of Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] about the 1 or 2 I
looked the marshes over, I found

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00020|dnp14k018pp|79525294[/page]
snipes & young snipes & a
young reeves & ducks; but
no double snipes though the
ground appeared excellent
for them. they appear here
later, so that probably they
breed further north in the
Lapland marshes. [deletion]yet a[/deletion]
& a few only [deletion]mar[/deletion] haunt
the coasts of the baltic.
That they do occasionally breed
there I think can hardly be
doubted. Even at Bremen a
sportsman assured me of this
& at [place]place_1101|Undevalla[/place] in Sweden
another told me He had
found young ones not many
miles from the town that
could hardly fly. & that were so fat
that they burst in their fall.

The Bremen sportsmen assured me
that the males made a noise

Notwithstanding Sir Everard Homes
paper [deletion]on this subject[/deletion] aided by
my own researches, I confess that
nothing satisfactory to me has
been written on the subject. [person]person_148|Sir[/person]
[person]person_148|Ev.[/person] is not a sufficiently minute
observer even aided by Bauer's
microscope to place full confidence
in his view of the organ of
generation, that the animal
is Hermaphrodite & selfimpregnating.
There is an excellent memoir
on the subject by Spallanzani
the last in the sixth V[superscript]o[/superscript] of his
Vigii nelle due Sicilie "Opuscoli
due sopra le Anguille. pag 194
& following published in 1797.

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00025|dnp14k023pp|79525299[/page]

Spellanzani & his friends seem to
have made an immense number
of observations on fresh water Eels.
He clearly confutes the opinion
that they are viviparous shewing
that what have been supposed
capillary eels are [nonenglish]nonenglish_342|Vermes[/nonenglish]
belonging to the intestines & not
to the Uterus. - He [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] asserts
that what Vallisneri believes
to the ova are globules of fat
owing to a disease in certain eels
but thinks it possible that the
two sets of fringed bodies which
Vallisneri decribes adhering to the
interior of the spine may be the
ovaria & He finds another set
of small globules different from
the first. Malpeghi was of the
opinion of [person]person_453|Val.[/person] that they are the
[deletion]of[/deletion] ovaria & I do not doubt it

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00026|dnp14k024pp|79525300[/page]
& this part of Spellanzanis memoir
is not so convincing as the other
parts because depending upon observation
with the lens. [deletion]there no[/deletion] He confirms
[person]person_453|Val.[/person] supposed ova with the globules
of fat in the stomach & bowels
but He always allows [underline]globules[/underline]
which are not the same & which
are not of fat & which therefore
can hardly be any thing but ova.
Splenzani says that having opened
497 eels of different sizes
He never found these globules
larger in the mature ones than
in the small ones & that they
always have the same proportion
to the smaller fat globules
but of 2 to 1 "de cupla" -
Spell[superscript]i[/superscript]. wishes other observations
to be made & seems to suspect
that this melt may be in the

same fringed mass with the ova
& that the Eel may be hermaphrodite
& He says that Cave[insertion]a[/insertion]lini has
discovered that this arrangement
exists in two species of Perch

[insertion]1 Vol. Naples. Trans R B. A.[/insertion]
[person]person_308|Spel.[/person]seems inclined to doubt
if the fringes of Malpighi &
[person]person_453|Vales.[/person] are ovaria. because they
do not become much larger in
the migrating eels. but it is
possible that the migration is
not owing to puberty; but a consequence
of increase of size & the greater difficulty
of keeping a large mass warm in [underline]winter.[/underline]
a little eel can hide itself in mud
where a great eel would be very
uncomfortable & the [underline]salt[/underline] water

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00028|dnp14k026pp|79525302[/page]
& still greater increase of bulk
may be necessary to the development
of the [underline]ova[/underline]
The [underline]eel[/underline] in the sea is
the animal to look to
& it is on them that I
have induced Sir Everard
to work. If the Conger
be the same animal, there
can be no doubt of its possessing
the [underline]ova[/underline], at least I have
no doubt, though I still have
of its double sex.
The fishermen of Mountbay
who have opened thousands
of great congers say they have
never found roe; but this may
be from the peculiar character
of the [underline]ovaria[/underline], I opened two
in Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] [insertion]1821[/insertion] & found the large

Spinal fringes, but no distinct ova
It would be well to examine
the chemical nature of these
fringes in Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] or Nov[superscript]r[/superscript].
& to see if they are gone
in [underline]Congers[/underline] [deletion]of[/deletion] in Feb[superscript]y[/superscript] & March
The young Eels must be born about
this time.
That all eels migrate
from the [underline]sea[/underline] there can be
no doubt & they seem to
be born in different years
at different times. in 1823 .
there were millions at the fall
at Ballyshannon in July.
In 1825 at the same season
there were hardly any, the first
was a cold the other a hot season.
Or is the [underline]fresh water[/underline] necessary
to the growth of the young eel

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00030|dnp14k028pp|79525304[/page]
when in the winter of 1821
in not very cold weather, I put
eels of different sizes into
salt water all the small
ones [underline]died[/underline]. & the only ones
one of six or seven that
lived was nearly 10 inches long
the death of the smaller ones
was / rapid in proportion

I have seen Eels of all

that there are Eels on the

I never saw such a piece of

do, I saw his black spots

He took a small roach.

the day was cloudy till 2 oClock
& though I tried all kinds of
baits, [underline]roach[/underline] [underline]bleak[/underline] & [underline]chub[/underline]
by spinning, & alive, I could
not raise a fish. What
can be the reason of this ?
I saw a Huco [insertion]Quere was it not a grayling?[/insertion] rise two or
three times & I tried the fly
& a small bleak in the spot
but entirely without success
From the quantity of the fish
[deletion]I think it[/deletion] & the variety of
sizes from 30 lb to 3 oz
I think it must be a
Danube trout probably originally
of the black sea; but I got
a small one in the market
which must have wintered
in the river about 10 inches

with a fly & a Hucho with

The Hucos in this little stream
have probably less food than in
the Laybach river, for I hooked
a small one with a fly: but He
escaped. & I hooked another larger
one probably more than 2 lb who
likewise escaped with a small fish

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11411-000-00068|dnp14k066pp|79525342[/page]
these fish seem peculiarly
fitted for these tributary streams
of the Danube which abound
in coarse fish food for
the Huco. - A Huco would
starve in most of our
mountain rivers.
These Hucos this day
ran with great violence
at the small fish
which were roach & dace
& yet the stream was
a clear mountain stream
running over Limestones.
The Guide says there are
few or no trout in this

These medows seem excellent

the short grass forms the

all the migratory animals

some observations on the physical

active & strong & from its predatory &
mobile habits acquires large teeth
large fleshy fins, thick skin &
great pectoral fins for turning.

it [insertion]may[/insertion] gains the stomach of the char
& its colours - as in the Gillaroo
trout & the Char when it

I have seen few finer fishing
incidents than the one of this day
the large trout who was lying
at the edge of the foam of the
fall rose at the fly & was slightly
hooked only. I changed the fly &
put on a larger one. & He took
immediately & dashed away into
the rapid water. where He sprang
high in the air. He then went
to the bottom & I unwisely suffered
him to run supposing He would go
down the fall instead of which
He ran to the bank & there
felt his strength & broke a slender
stretching line. Went at at 10 returned

The grayling I think are yellower in
the Ager than in the Voecla, a
proof that their colour is not occasioned
by the colours of the water - though probably
by its extreme purity which gives more
power to [underline]light[/underline]. Went to the
Bridge over the Agger about 1/2 a mile
from the town. Caught a number
of Graylings two very fine over 1. 1/2 lb
+ Was soon satiated with sport &
changed my tackle with the hope
of catching a Huco - put on a
roach & soon caught a fish
which to my surprise was an
excellent pike of 2 lb & which
I ate for dinner - Had two or
three other runs which I think
were from large chub as the
[underline]fish[/underline] was not torn by teeth
& hooked one other small pike who
got off. - Took my Grayling

per day 4..[superscript]f[/superscript]30. Had yesterday & today
Grayling fried excellent, I think they have
more curd & are fatter than the english
fish, they are certainly much yellower.
Went out again at six a beautiful
evening for fishing, calm had excellent
sport caught ten or twelve great Graylings
from 2 lb to 1 lb - which I saw rise
at the fly. Ther[superscript]r[/superscript]. in room 62.

last night, of the kind with bushy wings
& B says He saw two out of doors.
Ther. at 1/2 past 7 in room 60 in

miles [deletion]open on[/deletion] the road opens on Mondsee
which is likewise a beautiful lake.
Went after dinner to the small
river where I fished 9 years ago
fished for 1/4 of an hour caught
a large grayling & 9 or 10 small
trouts. Thermometer here about 60,

It turned out a rainy morning. I went
however to the river, & caught principaly
with the Mayfly a number of
small trouts I should think 40
& four large Grayling, Two I
measured more than 15 inches long
I should quess them 1 lb 3/4
1 grayling with the Mayfly
3 of the grayling with the blue
dun. - T. at 60 in room at

A beautiful evening, the mountains
illuminated above the lake
by an unseen sun & the
western sky in a blaze of
vermilion; [underline]light[/underline] so bright
succeeded by almost absolute
darkness. - My evening walk
was to the hill above the
lake from which the views are
very beautiful. -

legs of a very large frog recently
killed, wire of Platinum was
connected with the Multiplier
& with the two crural nerves
& a large piece of foil of
Zinc was placed under the
thighs, the communication
was made through the
multiplier, violent contractions
of the muscles took place
but there was no magnetic

it seemed as if a needle

acquired a slight degree of

None of the other experiments

Ravenna. Pal. Apost. This day
23. March 1827. I made an
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [deletion]to[/deletion] concerning the magnetizing
effects of light. The results of
Baumgarter must [insertion]ought to[/insertion] depend
either upon the [underline]colour[/underline] given
to the steel by oxidation
or to the - effects of
the oxide as an electrical
[unclear]equal[/unclear]. I tried[underline] steel[/underline] which
was half oxidized so as to be
black, it appeared to me to
become the N. pole ie the
oxidized part. - This I think
was certain, I tried a
