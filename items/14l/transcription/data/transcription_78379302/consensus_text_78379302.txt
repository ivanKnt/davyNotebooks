There is the [insertion][underline]elastic[/underline][/insertion] [underline]air[/underline]
naturally without colour
- I think certainly not
of the same colour
as pure water light
blue; but darker, this
colour is owing to
the aqueous vapours
which always exists
in it or upon
one [insertion]or all[/insertion] of its [unclear]pure & most[/unclear]
elastic constituent
parts it is impossible
to say - The blue is
deeper in proportion
as there is less vapour
or rather less mist
