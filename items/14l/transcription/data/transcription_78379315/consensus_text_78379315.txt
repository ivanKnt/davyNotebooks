[underline]The blue salt[/underline] is found both
at Hallein & at Halstadt
but not at Aussee - At Halstadt
the places where it is found
are infested with inflammable
[underline]air[/underline] but not at Hallein
the blue salt of Halstadt is
much the finest the large crystals
much the finer & the large droplets
come from Hallstadt - Is it
a bituminous substance? charcoal
pulverized in sulphuric acid rendered
it [underline]blue[/underline]?.
[underline]Styria[/underline] is entirely or nearly so
Calcareous & I have never seen any where
so many goitres; the persons who
 drink wine have them not?
Quere would not the use of a
small quantity of alkali prevent this
terrible evil - worth the attention
of the [underline]Austrian government[/underline]
