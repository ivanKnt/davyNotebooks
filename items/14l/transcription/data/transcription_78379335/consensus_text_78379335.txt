There is a beautiful circumstance in
 the oeconomy of the Globe which I
believe has not been attended to;
That water at low temperatures preserves
heat: A power of losing it
either by radiation or communication
being very [underline]small[/underline]: & Hence
all polar lands near deep seas
are comparatively warm..:
but when its temperature is
raised its power of giving
vapour which carries off the
heat is greatly increased. the
warm water above 50 which
is the equalizing temperature
[deletion]carries off[/deletion] is higher than
cold water: it rises to the
surface where it becomes more
warmed by by solar rays.
