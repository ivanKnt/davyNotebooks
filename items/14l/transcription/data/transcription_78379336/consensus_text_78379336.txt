& assumes the form of vapour
ie. the increment of heat
is lost causing the water to
assume the gaseous state.
Hence under the line; the
action of the solar rays upon
deep water [underline]never[/underline] raises the
temperature above [underline]81[/underline].-
- The power of water to become
steam & of course its power
to carry off heat is wonderful
increased with increase of
temperature probably in a ratio
not much lower than the
[unclear]square[/unclear] of the temperature hence
above 100. it would be
very difficult by radiant
heat penetrating a surface
to raise the temperature
