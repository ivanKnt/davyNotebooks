The mass[deletion]ive[/deletion]y [insertion]massy[/insertion] pillars of the Earth
1 The Inert Rocks, the solid stones;
Which give no [deletion]life[/deletion] [insertion]power[/insertion] no motion birth,
Which are to nature lifeless bones.
[Horizontal rule]
Change slowly; but their dust
remains
2 And every item measured weighed:
Is whirled by blasts along the plains
- or in the fertile furrow laid.

[deletion]the height[/deletion]
The drops that from the transient 
shower
3 Fallen in the noon day bright & clear-
Or kindle beauty in the flower;
Or waken freshness in the air.
