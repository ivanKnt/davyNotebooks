[underline]June 9 - 1818[/underline]
We left Ratisbonne for Vienna
on the [underline]Danube[/underline].
June 11. - Made some observations
on the temperature of the
water & on the cause of mists
which appear to me worthy
of being recorded -
The temperature of the
Danube at Passau at
the surface was 62 that of
the atmosphere was 54 - the
whole bed of the river was
covered with mist -
The Inn on the other side
of Passau had a temperature
of 57 & this has

[page]4||dnp14l02pp|78379282[/page]
was little mist. but
some slight vapours only
The [unclear]Rhind[/unclear] had a
temperature of 56 only
& on this [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] was
no mist when the
three rivers joined together
the temperature of the surface
sunk to 59 the waters
of the Inn coloured the
whole. - the quantity
of vapour was immediately
diminished, but the warmer
water of the Danube soon

[page]5||dnp14l03pp|78379283[/page]

found its place again &
a few 100 yards below, the
[deletion]whole[/deletion] temperature was restored
 to 60 61.2 & there was
again mists. -
[Horizontal rule]
The Danube is greenish
the Inn, [underline]white[/underline]
the [unclear]Rhind[/unclear] has the appearance
of a peaty water [underline]but[/underline]
perfectly clear, I have
no doubt, [deletion][unclear]but[/unclear][/deletion] that
the temperature of the
Inn [unclear]which[/unclear] is higher
than might be
expected from so
short a course
[Pencil sketch possibly of mist]

[page]6||dnp14l04pp|78379284[/page]
is owing to its fulness
ie the opacity of the
water must occasion the
sunbeams to affect it
underline]more[/underline]
The great denseness 
of the [unclear]Rhend[/unclear] & its}
shallowness occasions} this not good
much of the rays to}
be reflected - It is a peaty
water. -
I have no doubt [deletion]but[/deletion]
that hot water coming
in contact with cold

[page]7||dnp14l05pp|78379286[/page]

air is always the cause
of mists upon rivers
& never hot air coming
in contact with cold
[underline]water[/underline]. -
For [insertion]hot[/insertion] air if saturated with
moisture on coming in contact
with colder water will
[underline]lose its vapour[/underline] at the
same time that it loses
its heat & both will
be communicated to
the water & the cold

will float upon the water

A. What a beautiful night
- I never saw the sky of
so deep a blue above
[deletion]the glacer[/deletion]
.The glaciers. Its tint
is almost black, [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]stars are so brilliant[/deletion]
The superior brilliancy
of the fixed stars gives

readily coincides with

[page]18||dnp14l16pp|78379300[/page]
the idea of their being
[underline]habitable[/underline] worlds -
What is the reason of
the superior clearness of
the atmosphere in high regions
& of the deepness of the
blue
B. It requires no more
profound knowledge to
discover the reason
surely the deficiency of
[deletion]the[/deletion] vapour. Mist
is what & in proportion
to the quantity of
mist, the air must
become [deletion]grey light[/deletion] paler
light blue, or even grey.

There is the [insertion][underline]elastic[/underline][/insertion] [underline]air[/underline]
naturally without colour
- I think certainly not
of the same colour
as pure water light
blue; but darker, this
colour is owing to
the aqueous vapours
which always exists
in it or upon
one [insertion]or all[/insertion] of its [unclear]pure & most[/unclear]
elastic constituent
parts it is impossible
to say - The blue is
deeper in proportion
as there is less vapour
or rather less mist

[page]20||dnp14l18pp|78379303[/page]
& on the top of Mt Blanc
[person_368]de Saussure[/person_368] found the colour
of the atmosphere above his
head almost black -
As blue is one of the primitive
colours & can not be composed
from any other colours, it
is probable that only one
[deletion]of[/deletion] element of the atmosphere
is of this colour & that the
others are colourless -
[deletion]I cannot allow this[/deletion]
It is probable but not I think certain
as there are at least
4 constituents of the
[unclear]atmosphere[/unclear], oxygen Azote
Carbonic acid & water, it is
possible that the colour of
three of these substances
may produce white, thus a

[page]21||dnp14l19pp|78379304[/page]
19
mixture of green red
yellow & deep blue
[deletion]would[/deletion] in certain proportions
would produce a tint
of blue, the green red
& yellow as it were annihilating
each other. - & it is probable
that each elastic fluid is
different in colour: but from
their transparency large
masses are required to demonstrate
their colour; & colour must
always depend upon the
transmission or reflection
of some rays of light & the
absorption of others. - Even
gaseous chlorine & gaseous
iodine when examined in
very small masses appear without

[page]22||dnp14l20pp|78379306[/page]
colour though one is
of a [deletion]beautiful[/deletion] yellowish green
& the other of a beautiful violet
colour when seen in
considerable masses.
- How many gaseous bodies
or vapours are then
known to have colours-
- comparatively few. Chlorine
and oxychloric gas of [deletion]the[/deletion] which
the [deletion]first is[/deletion] second is bright
yellow., almost orange . -
Iodine & the vapour from
indigo which are indigo or
violet, sulphur & a
new substance named by
M. Berzelius. Selenium
which are yellow, [unclear]Nitro[/unclear]

[page]23||dnp14l21pp|78379307[/page]
21
acid gas which is of a very
deep orange approaching to red.-
- What is the reason
of these various colours of
the clouds in the morning &
evening & why are these
colours always [unclear]parts[/unclear] of
red & yellow & never blue
greens or violet. -
Is it not that the
Sun being below our
Horizon [deletion]only[/deletion] the red
& orange rays which
are the most refrangible
rays reach us in
the largest quantity

[page]24||dnp14l22pp|78379308[/page]
- There are few more

- That this was the state

There is a beautiful circumstance in
 the oeconomy of the Globe which I
believe has not been attended to;
That water at low temperatures preserves
heat: A power of losing it
either by radiation or communication
being very [underline]small[/underline]: & Hence
all polar lands near deep seas
are comparatively warm..:
but when its temperature is
raised its power of giving
vapour which carries off the
heat is greatly increased. the
warm water above 50 which
is the equalizing temperature
[deletion]carries off[/deletion] is higher than
cold water: it rises to the
surface where it becomes more
warmed by by solar rays.

[page]51||dnp14l47pp|78379336[/page]
45
& assumes the form of vapour
ie. the increment of heat
is lost causing the water to
assume the gaseous state.
Hence under the line; the
action of the solar rays upon
deep water [underline]never[/underline] raises the
temperature above [underline]81[/underline].-
- The power of water to become
steam & of course its power
to carry off heat is wonderful
increased with increase of
temperature probably in a ratio
not much lower than the
[unclear]square[/unclear] of the temperature hence
above 100. it would be
very difficult by radiant
heat penetrating a surface
to raise the temperature
