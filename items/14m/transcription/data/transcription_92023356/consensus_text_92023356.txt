wood reservoirs. Yet
I have caught a good
many fish in the
evenings. The longest
Trout & Grayling not
much above a pound
I ascertained yesterday
that the [underline]spots[/underline] of the Trout
were in the skin & not
dependent on the scales
I caught one evening [insertion]9[superscript]th[/superscript][/insertion] 19 T
& Gr. but usually from
10 to 5 always in the
still pools out of the
turbulent direct channel
of the river.
I have closed the Seton
since I have been here
