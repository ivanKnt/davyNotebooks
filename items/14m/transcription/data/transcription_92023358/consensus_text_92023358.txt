It appears to me that
the [underline]best plan[/underline] with the
Book or [underline]Archaeus[/underline] or [deletion]Summer[/deletion]
days [insertion]of youth[/insertion] Will be to make
it Colloquial & [unclear]Colludial[/unclear].
I have two or three
+ Dialogues connected with
the Vision in the [underline]Colloseum[/underline]
one on the [underline]Sidereal system[/underline]
& on the results of motion
in this system.
Another Vision may
be [underline]geological[/underline] & two
[underline]dialogues[/underline] may be founded
upon this -
It may be a question
whether the [underline]Proteus[/underline]
& Hermes or Archaeus
or [deletion]an[/deletion] Animal Chem.
