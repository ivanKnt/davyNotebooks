at four - & [unclear]continued two hours[/unclear]
very heavy - The T which was 70, 74
is now fallen to 65.
Examined two Char, one a Male
which had the melt fully
developed - the other a female
the ova small - & of different
sizes I think with evident
marks of absorption.-
The Fisherman at Grundel see
says that both Trout & Char
deposit their ova & eat them
but that they spawn later
when [unclear]confined[/unclear] - I doubt this
exceedingly & I am inclined
to believe the [unclear]Innhofer[/unclear] who
says they do not spawn: but
this W has not [unclear]well explained[/unclear]
Some char taken at the
moment of dropping their ova
may do so & their parturition
is laborious & longer.
[underline]The ova[/underline] included from the Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]
