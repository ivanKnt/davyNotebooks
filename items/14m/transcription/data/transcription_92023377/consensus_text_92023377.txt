When the water was of this
temperature was only 62.63 -
Is it the [underline]heat[/underline] at the surface
that prevents the fish from
[underline]rising[/underline]? or is not the
fly off? - this water is
certainly much warmer than
the[underline]Traun.[/underline]
Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] 6 T 62.63 T - 1
a fine day.
Caught 5 Grayling
but they rose ill -
3 large. no fly on.
2 Grayling 14 inches long. 1 lb 2 [superscript]oz[/superscript]
more than a pound so that
the fish are heavier here
in proportion to their length
Went out in the evening
& shot 5 quails. a cool
[unclear]rainy[/unclear] evening
