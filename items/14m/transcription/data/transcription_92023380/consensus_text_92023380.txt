Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] 11 A dark cool day.
Went to Seekirchen
a lake about 10 miles
off. heard of a peculiar
fish called Sandalen
with a long back fin
like a saw, said to be
peculiar to this lake in
which there are likewise
Sobratzel, but could get
none - hunted over the
marshes in the neighbourhood
found a few ducks but did
not fire - no snipes
Is not this fish which they
say sometimes is large 20 lb
a variety of the [unclear]Perce Lac-Paca[/unclear]?
