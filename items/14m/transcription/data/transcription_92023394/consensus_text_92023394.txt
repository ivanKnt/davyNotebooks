as to the general merciless
character of field sports
but I doubt if this
part of the process
of the fly fisher [deletion]is[/deletion]
[deletion]a[/deletion] ought so strongly
to alarm your feelings
As far as analogies
from warm blooded
animals can apply
to the case, the death
that follows obstructed
respiration is [deletion]quick[/deletion]quick
& preceded by insensibility
[deletion]is quick & not remarkably[/deletion]
[deletion]painful[/deletion].
