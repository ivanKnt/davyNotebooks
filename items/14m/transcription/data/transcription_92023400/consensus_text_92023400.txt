being moral & intellectual
motives constantly operate
in enhancing the fear of death
which without these motives
in a reasoning being would
probably become null &

every slight occasion of pain
or disgust but imagination
is creative with respect
to both these passions which
if they exist in animals ex-
ist independant of reason
or as instincts. Pain seems
intended by an allwise Provi
dence to prevent the disso-

follow their destruction
