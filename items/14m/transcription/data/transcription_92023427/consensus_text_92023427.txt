[underline]Instinct[/underline]
Poetes you transiently
referred [insertion]Halieus[/insertion] yesterday to that
[underline]Instinct[/underline] of Salmons which
induces them to run
up river from the sea
on the approach of rain
You have had so many
opportunities of attending
to the instincts of
to the inferior animals
[deletion]in general[/deletion] that I
should be very glad
to hear your opinion
on that very curious
subject the nature
& development of instincts
