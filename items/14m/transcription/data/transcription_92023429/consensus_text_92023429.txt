Ornither. I believe we
have each a peculiar
view on this matter. In
discussion we may enlighten
& correct each other.
For myself I consider instincts
merely as results of organization
a part of the machinery of
organized forms.
Man is constituted so that
his muscles acquire their
powers by habit, their motions
are at first automatic
& become voluntary by association
so that a child must
learn to walk as He
learns to swim or write.
