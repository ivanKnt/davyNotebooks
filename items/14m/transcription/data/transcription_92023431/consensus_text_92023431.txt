Chasseur shot 1 Joketta, 1 Snipe.
I will mention one fact
more drawn from the
migrations of animals;
Swallows, & [deletion]&[/deletion] Quails & many
other birds migrate in large
flocks when their usual
food becomes scarce & in
these cases [underline]it may be said[/underline] (I
[insertion]anticipate a remark of Physicus)[/insertion]that the phaenomenon depends
upon imitation & that
the young birds follow the
old[deletion]er[/deletion] ones who have before
made the same flight; but
I will select the young
Cuckoo for an unexceptionable
example of the instinctive
nature of this quality.
He is produced [deletion]by[/deletion] from an egg
