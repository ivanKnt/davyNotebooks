education & migration of this
singular animal is a history
of a succession [deletion]of the most[/deletion] of
[deletion]extraordinary[/deletion] instincts, the more
remarkable because in many
respects contrary to the usual
order of nature.
[underline]Physi[deletion]cus[/deletion][/underline] I have been assustomed
to refer many of the supposed
instincts of animals such
as migrations & building
nests & selection of food
to imitation, but I confess
I cannot explain the last
fact. You have brought forward
in this principle. Pray
Ornither let me state your
view as I understand it
that we may not differ
in to the meaning of language.
