I conclude you adopt
Hartleys view of association
that the motions of [deletion]our[/deletion]
the muscles in Man
are first automatic
& become voluntary by
association, & the reason
is the application of
voluntary motions for a
particular end - For instance
a child is not afraid
of fire; but bringing
its hand near the fire
it is burnt & the convulsions
of the muscles produced by
the pain ends in removing
the hand from the source
of pain. These motions
by association are made
