[underline]Hal[deletion]ie[/deletion][/underline] That instincts depend
upon impulses immediately
derived from the Deity is
an opinion which though
it perhaps cannot be
confuted yet does not
please me so much
as to believe them
dependent upon the
formation of organs &
the result of the general
laws which govern the
system of the universe
& it is in favour of
this opinion that
they are susceptible
of modification. Thus
