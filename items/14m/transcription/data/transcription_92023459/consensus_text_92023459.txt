The thought which I have put
into bad italian, struck me
[underline]finally yesterday.[/underline]  I saw
a Michemass daisy full
of flowers, the last of its
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] race [insertion]Many Humble[/insertion] Bees, wasps
& various smaller [deletion]flies[/deletion] [insertion]winged insects[/insertion] which
appeared to me to be of
the [deletion]Ichneumia tribe[/deletion][insertion]Vespa or Apis families[/insertion]
[insertion]but[/insertion] were [insertion]principally bees[/insertion] feeding in almost
every flower, their tongues
searching the honey.
They were all languid
it was a cold evening
though the sun was bright
