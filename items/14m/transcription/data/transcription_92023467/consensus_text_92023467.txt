29. Went to the E M. shot
a snipe, a spotted rail & a jack
snipe the first I have seen
Its stomach contained hemp seeds
& a maggot was 1/3 the
size of the stomach of the
common snipe. The rail had
its gizzard full of seeds.
- The gizzard of the Gelinotte
contained the remains of
rasberries, [underline]the seeds[/underline] of
various trees, & the stones
of the cornel berry - but
no cranberries -
30 A fine day with clouds
went to the East marsh found only
one snipe at which I did not shoot
shot a land rail very thin &
small. probably in migration
