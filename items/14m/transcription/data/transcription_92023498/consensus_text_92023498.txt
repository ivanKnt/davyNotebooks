according to analogy to have affected
the needle I succeeded on the [unclear]7[/unclear]th
of October at Trieste in obtaining
a Torpedo about a foot long sufficiently
vigorous to give successive & continual
shocks which were passed thro' a very
delicate magnometer which was
extremely sensible to the electricity of
a single circuit [insertion][deletion]cle[/deletion][/insertion] composed of Tin
silver & [deletion]iron[/deletion]water but not the
slightest deviation in the magnetic
needle could be produced The shocks
were produced when the human body
body was made part of the circuit
so powerful as to be felt in both
wrists & in one instance strongly &
painfully even in the elbows &
shoulders. It is needless to say that
every precaution was taken to pass
the shock thro the entire circuit but
in no instance whether the communi-
cation was wholly thro' metallic
substances or partly thro'  the human
body & salt water in no instance
was there the [deletion]smallest[/deletion][insertion]slightest[/insertion] magnetic
