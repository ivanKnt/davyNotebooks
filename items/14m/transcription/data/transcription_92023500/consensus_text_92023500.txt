You are well acquainted with
the vague notions which prevailed
before the middle of the last 
century respecting the shock of the
Torpedo I will not dwell upon the
ideas of Redi or Borelli that the effect
was a mechanical one owing to
peculiar motions or vibrations of
the organs which possess the power
of giving the shock. Walsh you know
was considered as having proved the
phenomenon to be purely electrical
& M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish compared the organ
of the Torpedo to a large surface
very weakly charged & considered
the effects as depending upon elec-
-tricity in very large quantity but of
very low intensity. Volta when he
made his wonderful discovery of
the pile or galvanic column
imagined he had formed a perfect
artificial resemblance of the
organ of the Torpedo & his views
have been generally adopted.
