To use his [deletion][unclear]lower[/unclear][/deletion] jaws for cutting

analogy were correct the archi

employ his teeth for the same
purposes & tho I have known
distinguished men who have
been in the habit of using
knives for cutting furniture
with a sort of nervous rest

teeth being employed in the
same way & I think it would
be quite as correct to find
the architectural or construc

part of the body the tail as
the beaver makes a more
ingenious use of this part
than even of his mouth
