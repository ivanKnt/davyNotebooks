[underline]Monday[/underline]
July 21[superscript]st[/superscript] [place]place_774|[underline]Ischl[/underline][/place] I have
been here six weeks & used
the baths & douche for five
I think I have gained flexibility
& strength in the affected
limbs but my pulse is
raised & I have more
disposition to headaches
This may be from a decayed
tooth on the left side
& may be a favorible
symptom but I have
lowered my diet
The [place]place_182|Traun[/place] has been
in a state of constant
change but always high
& sometimes foul from
the great storms & discharges
of water from the

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00006|dnp14m002pp|92023356[/page]
wood reservoirs. Yet
I have caught a good
many fish in the
evenings. The largest
Trout & [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] not
much above a pound
I ascertained yesterday
that the [underline]spots[/underline] of the Trout
were in the skin & not
dependent on the scales
I caught one evening [insertion]9[superscript]th[/superscript][/insertion] 19 T
& Gr. but usually from
10 to 5 always in the
still pools out of the
turbulent direct channel
of the river.
I have closed the Seton
since I have been here

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00007|dnp14m003pp|92023357[/page]
but I keep up in a slight
discharge from the neck
by a perpetual blister -
I applied 2 leeches the 19
& two the 17 ad anum.-
My pulse this morning
immediately after breakfast
is 90 - My tongue
tolerably clean - 1 not quite
I have taken morning &
evening a grain of [unclear]blue[/unclear]
pill for a month & always
my aloetic pill before dinner
& a little extract of [unclear]Hyorcyanin[/unclear]
with the pills & at night
- I have occasionally used

It appears to me that
the [underline]best plan[/underline] with the
Book or [underline]Archaeus[/underline] or [deletion]Summer[/deletion]

it Colloquial & [unclear]Colludial[/unclear].
I have two or three

the Vision in the [underline]Colloseum[/underline]
one on the [underline]Sidereal system[/underline]
& on the results of motion
in this system.
Another Vision may
be [underline]geological[/underline] & two
[otherwork]otherwork_037|[underline]Dialogues[/underline][/otherwork] may be founded
upon this -
It may be a question

A note to add to [underline][otherwork]otherwork_042|Salmonia[/otherwork][/underline]
In rapid rivers of alpine
countries which are much
flooded, the best places
for angling when the water
is high or even in
its usual spring or early
summer state are not
in the large deep parts
or great streams, but in
still & quiet holes where
there is a bye current
or an eddy or in
small canals joining
the main stream. In

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00011|dnp14m007pp|92023361[/page]
these places fish particularly
[misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] seek for shelter in
high water
& [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]do not venture in
the rapids.
When the water is
very low in the [insertion]beginning of  spring[/insertion] end
[insertion]&after long [unclear]drouth in Autu[/unclear][/insertion]of summer in such [insertion]alpine[/insertion] streams
the fish collect in the
large deep pools & then
the rapids [insertion][deletion]and shallows[/deletion][/insertion] at the tops
& the tails of such pools
are the best haunts
both for Trout & [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] -

hardly know if I have gained
from the use of the [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical]

a little in the flexibility

[unclear]J[/unclear] 23 Caught 15 trout 1 G -
Kept 9 all small -
driven in by a storm
24 July - came to [place]place_229|Aussee[/place]
a beautiful day, examined
5 char four fem 1 male
- The ova were diminished
& irregular, as if in act
of absorption. In the sem
reservoir the absorption was
complete. - P at 3  79.
T in room 67. In Window. 69-[underline]70[/underline]

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00014|dnp14m010pp|92023364[/page]
Went at six to the [place]place_264|G see[/place]
Found the water in good
order but still high
Caught some fine trout
at the bottom of the
lake (three I think near
a pound each 1 more)
beautiful fish. It rained
before 8. The flies common
in [place]place_121|England[/place] in May were
in the water the drake
alder fly & red spinner.
25 July. T at 7. in w - 58
at 9 in room 64 -
Went to the [place]place_264|Grundel see[/place] -
a very hot & bright day - very
few flies on caught only some
small fish, the large fish
would not rise This was
probably [unclear]from[/unclear] their expecting a
thunder storm which came on

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00015|dnp14m011pp|92023365[/page]
at four - & [unclear]continued two hours[/unclear]
very heavy - The T which was 70, 74
is now fallen to 65.
Examined two Char, one a Male
which had the melt fully
developed - the other a female
the ova small - & of different
sizes I think with evident
marks of absorption.-
The Fisherman at [place]place_264|Grundel see[/place]
says that both Trout & Char
deposit their ova & eat them
but that they spawn later
when [unclear]confined[/unclear] - I doubt this
exceedingly & I am inclined
to believe the [unclear]Innkeeper[/unclear] who
says they do not spawn: but
this W has not [unclear]well explained[/unclear]
Some char taken at the
moment of dropping their ova
may do so & their parturition
is laborious & longer.
[underline]The ova[/underline] included from the Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00016|dnp14m012pp|92023366[/page]

formed when they are confined [insertion]so say both W & T[/insertion]

Is it the [underline]heat[/underline] at the surface

That fish take the

me for in its most

[insertion][person]person_217|Hal[/person][/insertion] The principal use of
the nostrils [insertion]in fishes[/insertion] I believe
is to assist in the
[deletion]pass[/deletion] propulsion of water

respiration but I think
there are some nerves
[insertion]in these organs[/insertion]which give fishes [deletion]some[/deletion] a

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00034|dnp14m030pp|92023384[/page]
sense of the qualities

to our sense of smell
[deletion]which must[/deletion][insertion]or[/insertion] [deletion]be[/deletion] perhaps
[deletion]more analogous to[/deletion] rather
our sense of taste.
for there can be no
doubt that fishes
are attracted by
scented pastes and [deletion]wo[/deletion]
scented worms which
are [insertion]sometimes [/insertion]used by anglers
that employ ground
baits: and in old
angling books there are
usually receipts for
attracting fish in
this manner: & though

With respect to the

on its fringes or its

Poet The explanation
that you have just been
giving [deletion]are[/deletion][insertion]us[/insertion] of the effects
of playing the fish
I confess alarms me &
makes me [deletion]doubt if[/deletion][insertion]more afraid[/insertion]
[insertion]than I was [insertion]before[/insertion]that we are[/insertion][deletion]We are not[/deletion] pursuing
a very cruel amusement
for death by strangling
I conceive must be very
[deletion]painful &[/deletion] laborious, slow
& painful
Phys, I think as I
did before I was an angler

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00044|dnp14m040pp|92023394[/page]
as to the general merciless
character of field sports
but I doubt if this
part of the process
of the fly fisher [deletion]is[/deletion]
[deletion]a[/deletion] ought so strongly
to alarm your feelings
As far as analogies
from warm blooded
animals can apply
to the case, the death
that follows obstructed
respiration is [deletion]quick[/deletion]quick
& preceded by insensibility
[deletion]is quick & not remarkably[/deletion]
[deletion]painful[/deletion].

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00045|dnp14m041pp|92023395[/page]
There are many instances
of persons who have
recovered from the
apparent death produced
by drowning & who
had no recollection
of insensibility having
been preceded by any
violent or intense
agony. Indeed the
alarm or passion of
fear generally absorbs
all the sensibility
& the physical suffering
is [deletion]often[/deletion] lost in the
mental agitation
I can answer [deletion]by[/deletion][insertion]from[/insertion] my
own experience that

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00046|dnp14m042pp|92023396[/page]
there is no[deletion][insertion]violent[/insertion][/deletion] pain [deletion]produ[/deletion]
which precedes the
insensibility occasioned
by [deletion]p[/deletion] breathing gases
unfitted for supporting
life, but oftener a
pleasurable feeling
as in the case of
the respiration of
[chemical]chemical_048|Nitrous oxide[/chemical]
And in the suffocation
produced by the
gradual abstraction
of air by breathing
in a close room
where [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] is
[deletion]was[/deletion] burning we

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00047|dnp14m043pp|92023397[/page]
have the record of
[person]person_1074|the son of a celebrated[/person]
[person]person_1074|chemist[/person], that the
sensation which precedes
the deep sleep that
ends in death is
agreable.-
There is far more
pain in recovering
from the insensibility
produced by the abstraction
of air [insertion]than in undgoing it[/insertion] as I can
answer from my own
feelings: & it is [insertion]I believe[/insertion] perhaps
[deletion]quite[/deletion] true what has been
asserted that the pain of
being born which is ac-
-quiring the power of res
-piration is greater

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00048|dnp14m044pp|92023398[/page]
than that of dying which is
that of loosing the power
Orn. I have heard that persons
who have been recovered from
the insensibility produced by hanging
have never any recollection of
the sufferings which preceeded it
& as the blood is almost imme
diately determined to the head
in this operation probably
apoplectic insensibility is almost
instantaneous [deletion]you have pro-[/deletion]

Hal. The laws of nature
are all directed by divine
wisdom for the purpose of  pre
-serving life & increasing hap
-piness Pain seems in all
cases to precede the mutilation
or destruction of those organs
which are essential to vitality
& for the end of preserving
them but the mere process of
dying seems to be the falling
into a deep slumber & in
animals who have no fear of

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00050|dnp14m046pp|92023400[/page]
death dependant upon ima-
-gination it can hardly be
accompanied by very intense
suffering In the human
being moral & intellectual
motives constantly operate
in enhancing the fear of death
which without these motives
in a reasoning being would
probably become null &
the love of life be lost upon
every slight occasion of pain
or disgust but imagination
is creative with respect
to both these passions which
if they exist in animals ex-
ist independant of reason
or as instincts. Pain seems
intended by an allwise Provi
dence to prevent the disso-
-lution of organs & cannot
follow their destruction

Poiet. Give us no more instances
for I do not think it wise
to diminish the love of life or
to destroy the fear of death.
Hal. There is no danger of this
these passions are founded on
immutable laws of our nature
which philosophy cannot change
& it would be good if we
could give the same security
of existence to the love of
virtue & the fear of vice or
shame which are connected
with eternal life & death &
which ought to occupy far more

born for immortality -

surprised me more than

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00058|dnp14m054pp|92023408[/page]
their method of using
it. Instead of a

employed a small

of twine, the [insertion]fore[/insertion] legs of
which projected like two

threw at a distance
the frogs rose like

but the fish were

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00061|dnp14m057pp|92023411[/page]
too foul from the
deposition of calcareous

a good stream for the

I saw some trouts
in brooks in the [place]place_926|Sabine[/place]

[underline]Instinct[/underline]
Poetes you transiently
referred [insertion]Halieus[/insertion] yesterday to that
[underline]Instinct[/underline] of Salmons which
induces them to run
up river from the sea
on the approach of rain
You have had so many
opportunities of attending
to the instincts of
the inferior animals
[deletion]in general[/deletion] that I
should be very glad
to hear your opinion
on that very curious
subject the nature
& development of instincts

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00078|dnp14m074pp|92023428[/page]
in general.
Halieus. [deletion]If you[/deletion]
[deletion]recall[/deletion] You must
remember that in
the conversation to
which you allude
I avoided even to
pretend to define the
nature of instinct: but
I shall willingly discuss
the subject & I expect
from yourself Ornither
& physicus to [deletion]receive[/deletion]have
more light thrown upon
it than I can hope
myself to bestow.

[page]79|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00079|dnp14m075pp|92023429[/page]
Ornither. I believe we
have each a peculiar
view on this matter. In
discussion we may enlighten
& correct each other.
For myself I consider instincts
merely as results of organization
a part of the machinery of
organized forms.
Man is constituted so that
his muscles acquire their
powers by habit, their motions
are at first automatic
& become voluntary by association
so that a child must
learn to walk as He
learns to swim or write.
But in the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] colt
or the chicken, the limbs

[page]80|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00080|dnp14m076pp|92023430[/page]
are formed with the
power of motion, & these
animals walk as soon
as they have quitted
the womb or the egg.-

I will mention one fact
more drawn from the
migrations of animals;
Swallows, & [deletion]&[/deletion] Quails & many
other birds migrate in large
flocks when their usual
food becomes scarce & in
these cases [underline]it may be said[/underline] (I
[insertion]anticipate a remark of Physicus)[/insertion]that the phaenomenon depends
upon imitation & that
the young birds follow the
old[deletion]er[/deletion] ones who have before
made the same flight; but
I will select the young
Cuckoo for an unexceptionable
example of the instinctive
nature of this quality.
He is produced [deletion]by[/deletion] from an egg

[page]82|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00082|dnp14m078pp|92023432[/page]
deposited by his mother in
the nest of another bird
generally the hedge sparrow
wholly unlike her in habits)
He destroys all the other
young ones hatched in the
same nest & is supplied
with food by his foster parent
[insertion]after he has destroyed all her natural ofspring[/insertion][deletion]parent[/deletion] quite solitary He
is no sooner able to fly
than He quits the country
of his birth & finds his
way with no other guide
than [insertion]his[/insertion] instinct to a [deletion]country[/deletion]
land where his parents
had gone many weeks before
him & he is not pressed
to make this migration
by want of food ; for the
flies on which he feeds
are still abundant. [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
The whole history of the origin

[page]83|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00083|dnp14m079pp|92023433[/page]
education & migration of this
singular animal is a history
of a succession [deletion]of the most[/deletion] of
[deletion]extraordinary[/deletion] instincts, the more
remarkable because in many
respects contrary to the usual
order of nature.
[underline]Physi[deletion]cus[/deletion][/underline] I have been assustomed
to refer many of the supposed
instincts of animals such
as migrations & building
nests & selection of food
to imitation, but I confess
I cannot explain the last
fact. You have brought forward
in this principle. Pray
Ornither let me state your
view as I understand it
that we may not differ
in to the meaning of language.

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00084|dnp14m080pp|92023434[/page]
I conclude you adopt
[person]person_018|Hartleys[/person] view of association
that the motions of [deletion]our[/deletion]
the muscles in Man
are first automatic
& become voluntary by
association, & that reason
is the application of
voluntary motions for a
particular end - For instance
a child is not afraid
of fire; but bringing
its hand near the fire
it is burnt & the convulsions
of the muscles produced by
the pain ends in removing
the hand from the source
of pain. These motions
by association are made

[page]85|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00085|dnp14m081pp|92023435[/page]
voluntary & after this experiment
He avoids the fire [underline]by reason[/underline]
& takes care always to perform
those motions which remove
his limbs from this destructive
agent; but in contrasting
Instinct with this slow
process You would say
most animals without
having felt the effects
of fire have an innate
dread of it & do not
willingly approach near it
& in the same way without
having been taught or
experienced pleasure or pain
from the object, young [deletion]water[/deletion][insertion]ducks[/insertion]
[deletion]fowl[/deletion], seek the water
young chickens avoid it

[page]86|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00086|dnp14m082pp|92023436[/page]
their organs have a fitness
or unfitness for certain
functions & they use
them for these functions
without education. In
most the application
of the organ is independent
of experience & forms
part of a a train of
pure sensations.

[page]87|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00087|dnp14m083pp|92023437[/page]
[underline]Hal[deletion]ie[/deletion][/underline] That instincts depend
upon impulses immediately
derived from the Deity is
an opinion which though
it perhaps cannot be
confuted yet does not
please me so much
as to believe them
dependent upon the
formation of organs &
the result of the general
laws which govern the
system of the universe
& it is in favour of
this opinion that
they are susceptible
of modification. Thus

[page]88|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00088|dnp14m084pp|92023438[/page]
in domesticated animals
[deletion]the goose for instance[/deletion]
[deletion]the habit of migration[/deletion]
[deletion]is destroyed[/deletion] they are
always changed, the Turkey
& the Duck [deletion]are[/deletion] lose
their habits of constructing
nests & the goose does
not migrate.- In
supposing them the
result of organization
& hereditary they
might be expected
to be changed by
circumstances as they
are actually found
to be

[page]89|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00089|dnp14m085pp|92023439[/page]
Without referring the
instincts of animals to
the immediate impulse
of the Deity, they appear
to me to offer the
most irresistible &
convincing argument
that can be brought
forwards against
Atheism. They
demonstrate combinations

most refined intelligence

& of a wisdom [deletion]in which[/deletion]
[deletion]the result[/deletion] which can only

In reading an account

according to analogy to have affected
the needle I succeeded on the [unclear]7[/unclear]th
of October at [place]place_519|Trieste[/place] in obtaining
a [misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc] about a foot long sufficiently

silver & [deletion]iron[/deletion]water but not the

needle could be produced The shocks
were produced when the human body
body was made part of the circuit
so powerful as to be felt in both
wrists & in one instance strongly &
painfully even in the elbows &
shoulders. It is needless to say that
every precaution was taken to pass
the shock thro the entire circuit but

[page]149|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00149|dnp14m145pp|92023499[/page]
Since the discovery of [person]person_888|Oersted[/person] of the
magnetic effects of electricity it
has become an interesting problem
to ascertain whether this property
of common & [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] electricity
be possessed by the electricity of
living animals. I have long
sought for an opportunity of making
an experiment on the subject.
In 1815 I made on the coast of Roma
-nia & at [place]place_156|Naples[/place] some experiments
which proved to me that the shock
of the [misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc] did not possess the
chemical powers of [chemical]chemical_161|Voltaic[/chemical] electricity
I could neither decompose water
by it when sent thro' the finest
metallic surface or revive metals
from their solutions,
As these results seemed to give
a distinctive nature to the electri
city of living animals I was very
anxious to know if it possessed the
power of affecting magnetised
bodies. After various unsuccessful
trials to procure living Torpedos
which gave shocks that ought

[page]150|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00150|dnp14m146pp|92023500[/page]
You are well acquainted with
the vague notions which prevailed
before the middle of the last
century respecting the shock of the
[misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc] I will not dwell upon the
ideas of [person]person_1076|Redi[/person] or [person]person_789|Borelli[/person] that the effect
was a mechanical one owing to
peculiar motions or vibrations of
the organs which possess the power
of giving the shock. [person]person_525|Walsh[/person] you know
was considered as having proved the
phenomenon to be purely electrical
& [person]person_026|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish[/person] compared the organ
of the [misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc] to a large surface
very weakly charged & considered
the effects as depending upon elec-
-tricity in very large quantity but of
very low intensity. [person]person_199|Volta[/person] when he
made his wonderful discovery of
the pile or [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] column
imagined he had formed a perfect
artificial resemblance of the
organ of the [misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc] & his views
have been generally adopted.

Physicus will not find
[deletion]my[/deletion] any analogy between
my ideas & those

I am not ambitious

but [underline]I[/underline] shall not go so far
& I know no facts of this
Kind. The [misc]misc_334|gillaroo[/misc] &

decidedly with the same
characters & I have never
seen any fish which
seemed in [deletion]such a[/deletion] a
state of transition
from a trout to a
[misc]misc_334|gillaroo[/misc] or a char.
which I think must
have been the case
if such changes took
place.
I hope after this explanation

[page]153|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00153|dnp14m149pp|92023503[/page]
It might be said
that Trout after having
thickened their stomachs
by feeding on larvae
with hard cases gained
the power of eating shell
fish & were gradually
changed to gillaroos
& to char their red
spots & [insertion]the[/insertion] yellow colour
of their belly & fins
increasing.
In the same manner
it might be said that
the large Trout which
feed almost entirely
on small fishes gained

[page]154|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00154|dnp14m150pp|92023504[/page]
[deletion]were[/deletion] had flesh less red
than their parents & in
about 20 years, the
variety was entirely
lost & all the fish
were in their original
state.
A very speculative
reasoner might certainly
defend the hypothesis
of the change of [underline]species[/underline]
in a long course of
ages from the establishment
of particular characters
as haereditary, [deletion]but I[/deletion]
[deletion]know no instances of[/deletion]
[deletion]this k[/deletion]

[page]155|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00155|dnp14m151pp|92023505[/page]
deep red flesh introduced
into another lake where
the Trout had only white
flesh & they retained
the peculiar redness of
their flesh for many years
& at first they associated
together in spawning in
the brook which fed the
lake & they were easily
known from their darker
backs and brighter sides.
Gradually however from
the influence of food &
other causes, they were
changed the young trout
of the introduced variety

[page]156|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00156|dnp14m152pp|92023506[/page]
much on larvae & that
swallow their hard cases
become yellower & the
red spots increase so
as to outnumber the
black ones & these
qualities become fixed
in the young fishes &
establish a particular
variety - If Trout from
a lake or another river
[insertion]of a different variety[/insertion] are introduced into this
river, they do not at once
change their characters.
[deletion]but if they have [unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]retain them[/deletion] but this
gradually happens Thus
I have known Trout
from a lake in [place]place_235|Scotland[/place]
remarkable for their

Pray have you ever observed
Poietes any particular pro-
-tuberance in the nether
parts of any of our distin-
guished architects -
Poi - I am not a craniologist
but I would have the doctrine
overturned by facts & not by
ridicule & I have certainly
seen some remarkable in
-stances [deletion]in[/deletion] which [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] were
favourable to the system -
[underline]Hal[/underline]. My experience is en-
tirely on the opposite side &
I once saw a distinguished
craniologist in error on a
point which he considered as
the most decided. He was shown
five children one of whom
was possessed of great mathe
matical acquirents the other
of extraordinary musical taste
With the utmost confidence
he pronounced judgement & was
mistaken: it appeared to me
that whilst he was examining

[page]170|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00170|dnp14m166pp|92023520[/page]
To use his [deletion][unclear]lower[/unclear][/deletion] jaws for cutting
down the trees with which
he makes his dam [deletion]now[/deletion][insertion]&[/insertion] if this
analogy were correct the archi
-tect ought unquestionably to
employ his teeth for the same
purposes & tho I have known
distinguished men who have
been in the habit of using
knives for cutting furniture
with a sort of nervous rest
-lessness of hand I do not re-
-collect to have heard of the
teeth being employed in the
same way & I think it would
be quite as correct to find
the architectural or construc
-tive organ in the opposite
part of the body the tail as
the beaver makes a more
ingenious use of this part
than even of his mouth

[page]171|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00171|dnp14m167pp|92023521[/page]
motives & in man it usually
results from the love of glory
or the fear of shame & it appears
to me a a perfectly absurd idea
that of connecting it with an
organ which is merely intend
ed to assist the predatory
habits & the mastication of a
carniverous animal.
Hal. I agree with Phys in
this view of the subject. I once
heard a physiologist of some
reputation deducing an ar-
-gument in favour  of  craniolo-
-gy from the form of the skull
of the beaver which he called
a constructive animal &
contended that there was
something of the same
character in the skulls of
distinguished architects now
the skull of the beaver is
so formed that he is able

[page]172|MS-DAVY-11413-000-00172|dnp14m168pp|92023522[/page]
powerful support and a
strong bony apparatus in the
shoulder which might as well
be called the organ of courage
as the projection below the
frontal bone, but these
animals have no more what
is called courage in Man
than they have what is called
reason, they face danger
when they are hungry but
almost always fly when their
appetite is satisfied & a hen
in defending her chickens
against a powerful dog or
the game cock in fighting for
the female or the timid hart
[deletion]show quite as[/deletion] at the time of
the sexual intercourse show
quite as much of this quality
as the most ferocious royal
tiger, Courage is the result
of strong passions or strong

extensive chain of analogies
offer an argument in favour
of this long agitated generally
unpopular doctrine.
Physicus. In my opinion it offers
like most of the facts which have
been brought forward[deletion]s[/deletion][deletion]in favour[/deletion] [insertion]to prove[/insertion]
[insertion]the truth[/insertion] of the view of Gall & [person]person_975|Spurzheim[/person]
an argument rather unfavour-
-able [deletion]to the view at least[/deletion]
when thoroughly & minutely
examined
Poiet. How?
Physic. In these rapacious and
predatory animals the organi
-zation of the head must be con-
-nected with the functions of
the jaws as the construction
of the shoulderblade must
be related to the use of the
fore[deletion]arm or[/deletion] leg which being
intended to strike & seize by
[deletion]his[/deletion] talons must have a

Ornither It appears to me
that this [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc] has a more con
-siderable protuberance or pro-
-jection of bone between the
orbit of the eye and the extre-
-mity of the upper jaw than the
trout or salmon.
Halieus He has and you will
find a similar character in the
pike and perch and I believe
in most [deletion]vorac[/deletion] fishes of prey
and the use of it seems to be
to strengthen the fulcrum on
which the lever of the lower
jaw moves, so as to afford the
means of greater strength to the
whole muscular apparatus by
which the fish seizes his prey.
Poietes These fishes then are analogous
to the predatory animals of the
Feline genus which have [deletion]at[/deletion]
this part of the head exceedingly
strong & it is here that the Cranio
logists or phrenologists fix the
