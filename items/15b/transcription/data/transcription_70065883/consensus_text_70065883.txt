Shannon a fine river: but
though affected by the
tide certainly inferior
in size & (perhaps even
in the quantity of water
it sends down) to the
Thames & the severn at
equal distances from
the sea .-:
Marks of improvement
good buildings rising - a
hansome race of people
& more pretty young women
than I have seen since
our departure from London
a fine fall of the Shannon
when the Tide is down
