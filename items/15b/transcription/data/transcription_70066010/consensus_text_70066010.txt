mountains whose summits
were [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]hidden hidden in
said clouds -
-. [deletion]it[/deletion] Sunshine appeared
in some spots whilst
black clouds covered

I met with a singular race
of beings. the most gifted
with vague curiosity of any

whether they were civil
or uncivil & seemed
little daunted by reproof
