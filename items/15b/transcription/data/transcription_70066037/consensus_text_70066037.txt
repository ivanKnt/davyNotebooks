[underline]Zeolitic Basalt[/underline], ie a [underline]Basalt[/underline] of a
peculiar species - - - a cement of Zeolite
Basaltic Hornblende chrystals of feldspar
& green or yellow chrystals which are
probably Augite - . This is [insertion]to the north of the [unclear]rush[/unclear][/insertion]
the deepest stratum & is found to the
lowest on every side of the
promontory & likewise at the
Skerries where it forms the northern
side of the island upon it
is found a fine grained silicious
basalt & as the [underline]Zeolitic[/underline]
[underline]Basalt[/underline] approaches the point
of contact its grain becomes
finer & in some instances
It actually seems to pass
into the silicious Basalt. -
There are several Alternations
above this of the Zeolitic &
Silicious Rocks. & whether
above or below ie wherever
the two strata approach each
