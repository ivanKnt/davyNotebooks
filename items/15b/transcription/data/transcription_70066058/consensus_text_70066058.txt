decomposition & dislogment
took place - is of
some extensive change
upon a line of
many miles of strata
by which a separation
of parts might be
effected without any
great derangement of
parallelism.
The Basalt has
inclosed a part of
the stratum at the middle
of the mountain & has
formed both above & below
it; but this stratum is
still joined to the great stratum
& retains its parallesm &
is of the jaspideous constitution
