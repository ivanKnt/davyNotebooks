not in [unclear]excess[/unclear] the iron is in like manner precipitated

alkalized another solution - Yttria from one
by Vauquelin very pure, gave no alkalescence
but when mixed with red oxide of irn &
dissolved in Muriatic acid gave alkalescence.

iron; but not entirely separable by muriatic
acid from [unclear]thiate[/unclear] of iron: a [unclear]Zircine purified[/unclear]
