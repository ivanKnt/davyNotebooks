Where winter seems to mingle with the spring.
And lower still the olive tree appears
- The work of [unclear]alturn[/unclear] & the leafless vine
And the green [unclear]redden[/unclear], where the torrents sleeping
Or moves obedient to the wants of Man,
- [deletion]A[/deletion] Nature in savage wildness mountain [insertion]strength[/insertion]
[unclear]Oh[/unclear] Breathes in our pictures
with the [unclear]forms[/unclear] of art
