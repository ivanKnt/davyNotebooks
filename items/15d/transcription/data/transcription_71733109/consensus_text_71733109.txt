The Nitrogene with oxygene
8 [underline]cubical inch[/underline] with 4 Nitrous oxide
but 8 Nitrogene consist
of 8.8 . oxygene with [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]12[/underline] from
8 [underline]Nitrous oxide[/underline]
If Nitrogene could be decomposed
it would furnish exactly its
own volume of [underline]Hydrogene[/underline]
Is it decomposed in the residual
[underline]distillation[/underline].- If so the
water by which the whole of
the Ammoniac is generated
must give just as much oxygene
to the [deletion]Hydrogene[/deletion]
