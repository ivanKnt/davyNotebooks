[underline]Vauxhall[/underline]
The light was glimmering through the trees
As raised by magic power
And balmy was the waning breeze
And full of [underline]hope[/underline] the hour.
Cloathd in loveliness by pleasure
Before me lightly flew
In jocund pace to jocund measure
A gay & motley crew
Among them forms of beauty strayd
Fair as the morning beams
And in such fairy tints arrayed
As warm the poets dreams
With flowing locks that rested free
Upon the soft & fragrant air
With sweetest smiles of Harmony
And bosoms heaving full & fair.
No rapture kindled in my breast
unmoved the scene I saw
From fountains of delusive Art
No streams of natural love
can flow
