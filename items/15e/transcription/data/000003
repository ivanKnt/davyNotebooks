By me unnoticd passed the dream
Of Midnight revelry
As passes the first twilight gleam
Oer the half closed sleepy eye.
Away in Quietness I steall
To seek a soul to Nature dear
And if a transient joy I felt
It was that [person_002]Anna[/person_002] was not there

[Horizontal rule] 
Soft was the light that fell from her eye
As that of the Rainbow seen in the blue
sky. – And like that light though
bright & clear – It spoke of many
a coming tear.
Like the wave of the tear, uneven
her mind. When moved by the
blast of the westerly Wind. –
As soft & as changeful its colours
were given
how [deletion]glowing[/deletion] darkened with Earth
