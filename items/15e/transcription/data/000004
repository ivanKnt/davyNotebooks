Oh could our spirits winged with flame
Cast off their earth born chilly frame
[deletion]Yet carry[/deletion] [insertion]preserving[/insertion] all their thoughts that move
In holy harmony to love
[deletion]All[/deletion] [insertion]Ah[/insertion] then how blissful would it be
To traverse Natures reign with thee
[Horizontal rule]
The Earth should be our first abode
And We would chuse the mountain road
Basking upon the cliffs that lie
Beneath the [deletion]mornings changeful[/deletion] [insertion]dark unclouded[/insertion] sky
And whilst the sunshine spread below
The life of Natures genial glow
We in the snowy realm would rest
In clouds of changeful colour drest
The cataracts foam should be our boat
Upon the Torrents we would float.
