In vain I have swore I will love her no
more.
She torments, She perplexes; yet I must adore
Her form is a fairys airial & free
And now glowing with heaven
its soft & as changeful, were
all its wild dies
Slow darkend by Earth & now
Warm with the skies.
Like the fitful day of the
summer storm. –
Her heart by turns was
cold & warm. –
Short is her anguish &
tranquil her form
She hates me to day
She will love [underline]me[/underline] tomorrow.
