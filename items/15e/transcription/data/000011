like the fitful day of
the summers storm
Her heart by turns
is cold & warm
Though [deletion]I have lost thee now forever[/deletion]

Glows with the genial renovated flame
Of holy purity & honest love!
The thought that then [deletion][unclear]xxx[unclear] absent[deletion] [insertion]existeth[/insertion] warms
my mind
With a wild sentiment of angry [deletion][unclear]xxxx[unclear][/deletion]
