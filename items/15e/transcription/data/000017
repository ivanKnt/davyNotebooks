My [underline]throbbing[/underline] [underline]bosom[/underline] prest to mine
Shall swell with new & riper charm
[deletion]The gentle pressure of my arms[/deletion]
Thy earthy form shall grow divine
Within the pressure of my arms
And from that [insertion]strong[/insertion] [deletion]warm[/deletion] & living fount
Kindling [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] new roses in thy cheek
The purple stream of life shall
mount
[unclear]xxx[/unclear] why this change my lovely [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
Why
