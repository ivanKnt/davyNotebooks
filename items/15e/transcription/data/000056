[deletion]passed away[/deletion]
Since that [deletion]fair [insertion]bright[/insertion][/deletion] & [insertion]well remembered[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]revred[/unclear][/deletion] day
Ten [insertion][deletion]winters[/deletion] summers[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxx xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] now have
passed away.
And full matured time
has given
Thy charms “the perfectness
of heaven”
How [insertion]art thou[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxx days[/unclear][/deletion] changed

What majesty
Does in thy [deletion]changeful[/deletion] [insertion]varied[/insertion]
features lie”
And those who dare behold
thy face
Are awed by dignity of grace. –
