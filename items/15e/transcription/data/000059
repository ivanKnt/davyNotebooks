[underline]To Alba[/underline]
The colour of thy cheek is pale
As the fair fleecy mists that lie
Upon the meadows chilly breast
Adown the watered vale

Thy lips in colour scarce can
vie
Een with the late Autumnal
rose
Thy Hair in no rich wildness
flows
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear] is thy [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] eye.[/deletion]

Grey is thy humid eye.

And why for thee in care I pine[/deletion]
[deletion]Ah none [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] can tell; for none can[/deletion]
