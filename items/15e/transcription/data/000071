It is only by making
truths popular that their
existence can be ensured
Books may be destroyed
a new [unclear]Omar[/unclear] may
arise in a new emperor
& [underline]all things[/underline] [underline]may fall[/underline]
but prejudices conquered
cannot [underline]be [/underline][underline]re[/underline][underline]e[/underline][underline]stablished[/underline]
And if errors gain
[underline]power[/underline] from habit
& from the length of
time that they exist
truths will not easily
be forgotten more [unclear]espec[/unclear]
