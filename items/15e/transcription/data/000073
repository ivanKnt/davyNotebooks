Thou blooming wonder of Hygeian
power
Fair as the bud beneath the
vernal shower,
When the mild Zephyrs from the
ocean blows-
With joy in health I see thy
features glow
With every infant grace I see thee rise
Whilst pleasure sparkles in thy infant
eyes
Long mayst thou live & as 

thou livst improve
In all that wakens kindness
hope & love & love
To earth from art & nature
