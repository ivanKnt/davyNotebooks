Fair
New blooming wonder of
Thy [underline]fathers[/underline][underline] power[/underline]
Fair as the bud beneath
the [deletion]summers[/deletion] [insertion]vernal[/insertion] showers
When the mild Zephyrs
from the ocean blow
With joy; in health
I see thy features
glow
Radiate from Art &
Nature every charm
