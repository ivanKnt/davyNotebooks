The light was glimmering through the trees
As raised by magic power
And balmy was the waning breeze
And full of [underline]hope[/underline] the hour.
Cloathd in loveliness by pleasure
Before me lightly flew
In jocund pace to jocund measure
A gay & motley crew
Among them forms of beauty strayd
Fair as the morning beams
And in such fairy tints arrayed
As warm the poets dreams
With flowing locks that rested free
Upon the soft & fragrant air
With sweetest smiles of Harmony
And bosoms heaving full & fair.
No rapture kindled in my breast
unmoved the scene I saw
From fountains of delusive Art
No streams of natural love
can flow

By me unnoticd passed the dream
Of Midnight revelry
As passes the first twilight gleam
Oer the half closed sleepy eye.
Away in Quietness I steall
To seek a soul to Nature dear
And if a transient joy I felt
It was that [person]person_002|Anna[/person] was not there

[Horizontal rule] 
Soft was the light that fell from her eye
As that of the Rainbow seen in the blue
sky. – And like that light though
bright & clear – It spoke of many
a coming tear.
Like the wave of the tear, uneven

The life of Natures genial glow

In vain I have swore I will love her no

Slow darkend by Earth & now
Warm with the skies.

It may be a matter of surprise that the influence
of philosophical opinion has been so little
felt & so transient in its operation
but all astonishment will cease when
it is considered that the truths of
Science have been always limited to

of Men & not to their feelings.

which they have been delivered
its character must of necessity
have been different from that

It is principally in consequence of
improvements made in our Instruments
of experiment that the Sciences
have been so much extended
& that they have been made
the common property having
inclinations for studying them
& patience for pursuing them. –
Doctrinal speculations at
present cease to be formidable
in their influence; & variety
of opinion & [deletion]of the[/deletion] freedom
of thought can only produce
benefits in a department

–The demonstrations

founded upon invariable
properties of things; &
the results of experiment
must always convey
truths which though not
ultimate, owe their
imperfection not to
defect in our methods

but in the defect of
[underline]our sensations[/underline]. –
It is possible that
even on this point new
instruments may be discovered
there is sufficient to occupy
the genius & industry of
Philosophers for years to come.
This department of
Knowledge is one which
even [unclear][deletion]xx[/deletion][/unclear] coincides with
the common ideas of utility
the discovery of the nature
of the productions of
the globe & their applications

– [deletion]The [underline]Sciences[/underline][/deletion]
The [deletion]experimental[/deletion] [insertion]Natural[/insertion] Sciences
have one common foundation
facts which are observed
in Nature or [deletion]procured by[/deletion]
[deletion]means[/deletion] developed by artificial
inventions.
Experimental researches
have led to the greatest
discoveries made in modern
times for by mere
contemplation of events
extensive truths are seldom
gained. The senses are imperfect
they need assistance to enable
them to discover truth
& [deletion]by[/deletion] active enquiry by
the trials of results seems

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11505-000-00048|000047|000047[/page]
to be that which is best
fitted [deletion]for[/deletion] to our nature
& to the devellopement
of truth. –
– The Theories of natural
Knowledge which present
so beautiful a series of
combinations to the mind
have been slowly formed
by great industry & varied
Labour; & though the
methods which lead to
discovery are sometimes
unjustly neglected after
the discovery has been
made yet, they ought

in all cases to
claim the attention

study with the
hope of inventing
something new
& of those who
wish to make
themselves acquainted
with the knowledge
already acquired
