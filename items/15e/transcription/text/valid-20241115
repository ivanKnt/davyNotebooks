[underline]Vauxhall[/underline]
The light was glimmering through the trees
As raised by magic power
And balmy was the waning breeze
And full of [underline]hope[/underline] the hour.
Cloathd in loveliness by pleasure
Before me lightly flew
In jocund pace to jocund measure
A gay & motley crew
Among them forms of beauty strayd
Fair as the morning beams
And in such fairy tints arrayed
As warm the poets dreams
With flowing locks that rested free
Upon the soft & fragrant air
With sweetest smiles of Harmony
And bosoms heaving full & fair.
No rapture kindled in my breast
unmoved the scene I saw
From fountains of delusive Art
No streams of natural love
can flow

By me unnoticd passed the dream
Of Midnight revelry
As passes the first twilight gleam
Oer the half closed sleepy eye.
Away in Quietness I steall
To seek a soul to Nature dear
And if a transient joy I felt
It was that [person]person_002|Anna[/person] was not there

[Horizontal rule] 
Soft was the light that fell from her eye
As that of the Rainbow seen in the blue
sky. – And like that light though
bright & clear – It spoke of many
a coming tear.
Like the wave of the tear, uneven

The Earth should be our first abode

The life of Natures genial glow
We in the snowy realm would rest

Upon the Torrents we would float.

In vain I have swore I will love her no

She torments, She perplexes; yet I must adore
Her form is a fairys airial & free
And now glowing with heaven
its soft & as changeful, were

Slow darkend by Earth & now
Warm with the skies.

She hates me to day
She will love [underline]me[/underline] tomorrow.

It may be a matter of surprise that the influence
of philosophical opinion has been so little
felt & so transient in its operation
but all astonishment will cease when
it is considered that the truths of
Science have been always limited to

have been different from that

It is principally in consequence of
improvements made in our Instruments
of experiment that the Sciences
have been so much extended
& that they have been made

inclinations for studying them

Doctrinal speculations at
present cease to be formidable

–The demonstrations

the results of experiment

It is possible that
even on this point new

This department of

the common ideas of utility

– [deletion]The [underline]Sciences[/underline][/deletion]
The [deletion]experimental[/deletion] [insertion]Natural[/insertion] Sciences
have one common foundation
facts which are observed
in Nature or [deletion]procured by[/deletion]
[deletion]means[/deletion] developed by artificial
inventions.
Experimental researches
have led to the greatest
discoveries made in modern
times for by mere
contemplation of events
extensive truths are seldom
gained. The senses are imperfect
they need assistance to enable
them to discover truth
& [deletion]by[/deletion] active enquiry by
the trials of results seems

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11505-000-00048|000047|000047[/page]
to be that which is best
fitted [deletion]for[/deletion] to our nature
& to the devellopement
of truth. –
– The Theories of natural
Knowledge which present
so beautiful a series of
combinations to the mind
have been slowly formed
by great industry & varied
Labour; & though the
methods which lead to
discovery are sometimes
unjustly neglected after
the discovery has been
made yet, they ought

study with the

something new
& of those who
wish to make

In Yorkshire from the whole
western line of Road, I saw
stratified mountains – principally
silicious sand stone – with Magnesium
& shell limestone. – the silicious
sand stone runs into cumberland
but in Cumberland [deletion]we[/deletion] could
observe no organic remains. –
The mountains in Cumberland
& Westmoreland are Shist

These facts very important
as they show all these
Rocks to be congenerous
