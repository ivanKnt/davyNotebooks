            <note>A pupil of Socrates, much of Plato's large corpus of surviving philosophical texts are written in the form of Socratic dialogues. He espoused a philosophical idealism including the primacy of mathematics and an anti-democratic political philosophy because of the execution of Socrates. Plato's writings have been, and are, so influential that all subsequent philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato.</note>
