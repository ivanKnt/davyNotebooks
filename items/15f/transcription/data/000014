eloquence is a species of
[underline]enchantment[/underline]. You are captivated
with the majesty of his
diction, with the polish
of [underline]his periods[/underline]; & with
the splendour & pomp of
[underline]his description[/underline]. You forget
things in words, reasoning
is absorbed in feeling;
you cease to regard
the philosopher & you
consider only the poet.
And He has the art
of making errors so
delightful that you
quit it with regret
[underline]for truth[/underline]. –
