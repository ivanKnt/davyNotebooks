– [underline]Right Reason[/underline] is a true
Law conformable to Nature
constant immoveable eternal
common to all Men –
No part of it can be
decayed, retrenched, no
part changed no part
destroyed – No one
can be excused from following
it neither by the governance
nor the people – It
is intelligible without
commentary – It is the
same at Rome & Athens
today & tomorrow, eternal
unalterable it acts in
all countries & in all ages.
[underline]Cicero[/underline].
