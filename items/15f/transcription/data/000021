one of the earliest &
best of my friends
– The man who labours to
produce effect can never
have the highest degree
of Genius – that polish
of style, that smoothness
of versification & that
harmony of periods which
demand labour & labour
only are incompatible with
the strong & varied combinations
of [deletion]the Man of Genius[/deletion]
[underline]Genius[/underline]. – [deletion]Rest[/deletion] – Restlessnes
of thought, power superior
even to [?[deletion]xxxxxx[/deletion]]. Will.
Ardent but indefinite hope
