A flame which upward mounts
which [deletion]though earth born[/deletion]
sprang from earth
The Rock is mighty e’en when
fixed alone
Upon the barren & the desolate waste
Where is no growth no change of visible form
Save what the lichens & the moss bestow
In passing generations where is no sound
of life
Save in the summers sunshine at what
time
The solitary gadfly tunes his pipe a
passing stranger
Seeking richer spots.
fabric a dreary ruin
