– The loftier living nature of
“the Soul”
Of Animal being saddens & is sick,
This a day, which mighty
multitudes
Had set apart for pleasure,
[deletion][underline]Na[/underline][/deletion][underline] [/underline]thousands hoped
For tranquil sunshine, & had
for one day their plans
of happy caprice – Many
who confined,
For six long days amidst the
dusky walls
