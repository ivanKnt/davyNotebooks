Oh [deletion]could our spirits[/deletion] [deletion]accord[/deletion]

[deletion]with June[/deletion]

Cast [deletion]off their earth born[/deletion] chilly frame

[deletion]Yet carry all their thoughts[/deletion] that

move

In [deletion]holy harmony[/deletion]

In [deletion]Returning [/deletion][deletion]he[/deletion]

Oh [deletion]could our spirits winged[/deletion] with flame

Cast [deletion]off their earth born chilly [/deletion][deletion]frame[/deletion]

And yet retain the heavenly dower;

Of intellectual life & power

And then how blisful would it be

Become the Genie of Romance

No castles would I build in air

No living forms should haunt me

here
