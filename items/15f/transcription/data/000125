[deletion]But my delight[/deletion]

[deletion]My choice [/deletion]

My choice, my joy, my life should

be

To traverse Natures realms

with thee

The lark should be our

first abode

And We would chuse the

mountain road.

[deletion]And[/deletion] Haunting the snowy

cliffs that lie

Beneath the dark unclouded
