            <p>The equestrian statue of Charles I at Charing Cross, London, England, is a work by
               the French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur, probably cast in 1633 during Charles’ lifetime.
               It is the oldest bronze statue in London and is considered the central point of the
               city. It was installed in its current location in the centre of London in 1675, and
               the elaborately carved plinth dates from that time.</p>
