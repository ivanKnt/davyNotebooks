[Pencil sketch depicting valley cutting bordered by cliffs, with two mountains in the distance and a castle on the cliff top surrounded by trees/foliage. Trees fill the valley, along which runs a river crossed by an arched bridge with two supporting arches. In the foreground on the right, a wheeled vehicle (possibly a haywain) is travelling along the road. In the left foreground the ground rises and there are trees]
