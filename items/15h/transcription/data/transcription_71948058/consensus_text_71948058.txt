.- .The Heat produced in Voltaic electricity
may always be a destriction of repulsion
ie one - must possess particles
repellent of each other & likewies
the [unclear]one[/unclear] + & when these repellent
particles are brought into approximation
there ought to be less repulsion
ie Heat- ought to be made sensible
[unclear]as heat[/unclear] of temperature? -
[Horizontal rule]
The Same analogies may apply to
chemical objects ie + & -
or [unclear]condensation[/unclear] may always
produce a loss of repulsion
in annihilatin of repulsive
