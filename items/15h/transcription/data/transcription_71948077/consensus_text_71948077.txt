Then 2[deletion][unclear]6[/unclear][/deletion]8 of Sulphuretted 24 of Nitrous
Hydrogine - & gas will make -
1 Ammonia. ie [deletion]3[/deletion]1 of Nitrogine & 3
[deletion]will go to the[/deletion]
of Hydrogine will go to the
Ammonia. & 23 of Nitrogne &
23 of oxygine will form Nitrous
oxide & 2[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]5 of xygine &
2[deletion]4[/deletion]5 of Hydrogine will form
Water .

take [underline]23[/underline]
25 remains of oxygine but 25 of
oxygin demand 25 Hydrogen.
therefore instead of 24 we will take
25. Then
