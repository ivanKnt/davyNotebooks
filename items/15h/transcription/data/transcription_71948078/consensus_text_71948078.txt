- In - the decomposition
of Nitrous gas by Sulphuretted
hydrogine there must be free hydrogne
take for instance
24 Hydrogine &take 24. Nitrogine
24 Sulphur [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] 48 oxygen.
- Then 3 of Hydrogene & 1 of
Nitrogen make [underline]Ammonia[/underline].
There remains 21 Hydrogine
& 23 Nitrogen ; but 23
[deletion]21. Hydrogine demand[/deletion]
Nitrogene demand
23 of oxygene to
make Nitrous oxide
