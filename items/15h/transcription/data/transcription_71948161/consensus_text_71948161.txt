[deletion]The Hills of Cornwall.[/deletion]
The rocky eminences of
Cornwall have in no
case that high degree
of elevation which
would [unclear]entitle[/unclear] them
to the name of
Mountains, & the
principal peaks are
mere groups of rock
[deletion][unclear]top[/unclear][/deletion] projecting from high
accumulations of land
& are characterized in
the [deletion][unclear]old[/unclear][/deletion] ancient language
of the Country by
the name Carnes,
