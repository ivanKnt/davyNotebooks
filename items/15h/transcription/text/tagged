Humholdt is said to have observed
metallic rays in the [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] of
Unkeln. - a fact considered as in
opposition to the Volcanic Theory. -
- as the metals ought to be
in Spherules - - I have made
the observation upon the [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]
of [place]place_146|Portrush [/place]& of the [place]place_126|Giants Causeway[/place]
where [chemical]chemical_032|pyrites[/chemical] often occur in

The district of [place]place_1261|Auvergne[/place] is
granitic; but out of the granitic
country arise conical Hills &
insulated; & the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] is often
cut by what the Author calls
currents of lava. - [Three ink flourishes, the first of which has been turned into the sketch of a bird]
