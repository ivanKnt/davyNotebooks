            <note>A member of the Lincolnshire gentry, Banks sailed as a botanist on James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific (1768-1771). Elected President of the Royal Society of London in 1778 he served for forty-two years until just before his death. The dominant figure in the running of English science during that time, he became one of Davy's patrons and ultimately Davy succeeded him to the Presidency. FRSL.</note>
