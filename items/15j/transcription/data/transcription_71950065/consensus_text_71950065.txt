have filled my heart During the
last twelve hours - [unclear]O[/unclear] wonderful
physiognomy - We do not recollect
circumstances or ideas which have
been connected with feelings; but
feelings themselves modified &
combined in one emotion a
wonderful power of the human
mind. I am sick at heart
my pulse beats quick & irregular
my bosom heaves with sighs -
I am restless & anxious incapable
of either labor of body or
mind. -
NB The burning characters
of Rousseau -
[Horizontal rule]
He sees Laura & mistakes her for
his mistress, whom He believes he
may possibly see. .
