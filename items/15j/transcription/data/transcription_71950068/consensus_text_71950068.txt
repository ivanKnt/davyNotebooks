The affections of people educated in
the country are strong & permanent
because the objects to which they
are attached are few. -
Accustomed to connect no feelings
but those of nature with things
& forms their tastes are [unclear]uncorappted[/unclear]
& not at all modified by association
They are found of those terms which
awaken feelings or which call
up ideas connected with feelings
they are not possessed of that
artificial [unclear]fondness[/unclear] for [unclear]literature[/unclear]
founded upon the opinions of others
which exists amongst almost all
common place thinkers. -
Simple like children they are perpetualy
amused by their own creative
imaginations & if their pleasures
