I have seen her suffering pain & agony, I
have seen her whom I loved a pale &
lifeless corse, [deletion]yet I am alive[/deletion] lost to
a being that was united to
me, who formed part of my
existence, who modified & directed
all my feelings, I am still
alive ; I am alive & miserable.-
[deletion]The events of every life some[/deletion] She is gone but
her image [deletion]of[/deletion] shall never be effaced
from my mind, She is gone
& the universe is [deletion]of[/deletion] to me a blank.
The events of my life rise up
in my mind like the [insertion]restless[/insertion] images
& varying images in a feverish
dream, they have lost their
connexion & consistency.- Formerly
I loved to pass over with accurate
observation -
