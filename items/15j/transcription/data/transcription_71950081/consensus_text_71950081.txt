We say that children & uncivilised
beings say that they receive no
pleasure from the beauties of
nature this I suspect cannot be
the case. they receive a feeling
from beautiful objects which is so
different from that derived
from their common enjoyments
as to be connected with
eminently different terms-
[Horizontal rule]
The moving columns of light
this evening on the flowing
avon.
The language of pleasures &
pains show that, they are
perpetually modifying each other
& that they have little or no
distinct or successive existence
but are perpetually softening into
each other.
