Introduction
I am not differently organised from other men
The History of my life contains no grand or
interesting incidents. Like other Men I have
felt pleasure & pain [deletion]& recollect both of[/deletion]
[deletion]them[/deletion]. I have been an accurate observer
of the thoughts the passions & the sentiments
which have tended to evolve my present
character I derive a pleasure from
contemplating this evolution & I wish
[deletion]the[/deletion] other beings to be partakers of
this pleasure-
My manners proclaim me the solitary
but my heart is full of the
warmest sympathies, My bosom is
perpetually warmed by the fire of love
& of friendship; but the objects of
my passion are ideal beings.-
To me the world itself is an
agregate of ideal beings I am interested
in them even individually. I formed
them into new combinations I consider
myself as one of the feeble machines
destined to increase the general quantity
of happiness .-
