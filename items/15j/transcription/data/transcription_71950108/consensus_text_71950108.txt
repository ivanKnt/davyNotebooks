[Ink sketch of a mini toothy beast creature]
When we attempt indiscriminately to
counteract the pleasurable influence of the
senses we war against nature: that prudence
founded upon experience which teaches us
to restrain or to satisfy certain appetites

[Horizontal rule]
Man requires perpetual stimulation, his imagination
however heightened & refined will never prompt to
action unless it can grasp at a sensual

of indolence in which the understanding awakened
a thousand trains of future thoughts.
[Horizontal rule]
behold thy white light the last of
earthly things, shall not the robe of glory
envelloping me in another world be composed
