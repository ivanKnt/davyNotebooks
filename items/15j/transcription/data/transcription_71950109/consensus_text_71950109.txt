Plan of a Tale called the
Villager. for the common people to

prove that great cities are the abodes
of Vice.-
O my Children cried the old man how
gladly would I spend the whole of my
future existence, how joyfully would I accept
as my eternal reward the task of
improving ma[deletion]k[/deletion]nkind. Under my hands
thos[unclear]e[/unclear] immense cities [deletion]where men[/deletion] should
be annihilated, those immense cities
where men the natural masters of
words have become their servants
converted into machines of labor & of
destruction- I would again unite
man to Nature his only permanent
friend, the earth should be covered
with villages, trees should overshadow
them streams should water them
green fields should surround them.-
