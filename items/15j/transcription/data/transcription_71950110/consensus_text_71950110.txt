The deity love himself should dwell
amongst us & all should be one
family. -
He bade them look at the heavens
majestic with the light of the
sun He pointed to them the clouds
floating over the blue ocean
or covering with white light
the top of snowden & when He
saw their eyes glistening with the
tears of pleasure He pronounced
The word God. -
