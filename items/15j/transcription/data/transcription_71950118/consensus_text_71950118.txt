Marrish & Brush Kill Tyson[unclear]s[/unclear]
Murrish hanged because Brush
Killed Tysons [unclear]Mare[/unclear].-
Murrel was not a gentle man
his face was rough as the asparagus
clad rock that hung over his dwelling
& his smile was cold as the wintry
frost yet the gentleness of Mary
her joy speaking eyes & her playfulness
tended to sooth his rough heart &
to make him attached to her
Sometimes of a calm evening before

He took her in his fishing boat,
to one of the [insertion]little rocky[/insertion] islands in the cove
He showed her the sun setting, over
the hills of the west [deletion]He marked[/deletion]
& casting His streams of glory over
the waves. Mary would dress her
