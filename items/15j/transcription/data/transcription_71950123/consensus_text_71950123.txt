~ [underline]Taste[/underline].
I A subject much discussed but not exhausted
The science of Metaphysics like that of
Nature founded upon facts- Mind infinitely
more various in its forms & modes
of existence than matter & therefore requires
a more minute examination
II All pleasure & pain ultimately
+ founded upon what may be called primitive
sensations: & these are very similar
in similar individuals; but the sources
are soon forgotten & a variety of
causes tend to produce different
habits of feeling & thinking with regard
to external things "a noble river
is not like its spring head"
III. In studying taste it is not
more necessary to study the general
principles of the mind than to
consider its existing state.
