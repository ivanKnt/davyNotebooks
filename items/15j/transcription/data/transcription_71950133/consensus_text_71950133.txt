The proportion as our instruments become
more perfect so in proportion is there more
of the Vast unknown in Nature laid open
to our investigation - Every new discovery
opens a sphere of activity - The Sciences that
had at first the sublime truths of
speculative discovery for their objects
though born in Heaven have their
resting place on Earth. They connect
together at length the scattered Arts
& they form into a whole the
scattered fragments of the Knowledge
of Man.
It has been said of physical science
in general that the ideas it gives
us are too definite; this is false
as to Chemistry for as it presents
to us a variety of unknown causes
it may be said to be [deletion][unclear]most[/unclear][/deletion]
almost indefinite.
