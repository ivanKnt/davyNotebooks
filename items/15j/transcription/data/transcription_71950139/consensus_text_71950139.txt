as to the number & uses of their
organs & as to their chemical
composition & living powers. The knowledge
of the phaenomena of vegetation as
far as yet advanced has
extended only to a few plants

-. Our subject naturally divides itself
into 5 heads.- The composition of plants
physical & chemical; 2 The composition
of the natural agents [deletion]by[/deletion] which vegetables
are nourished.- 3 History of the growth
& nourishment of vegetables; as connected

changes they effect in soils. 4 Of the
