M[superscript]r[/superscript] Proust [deletion][unclear]&[/unclear][/deletion] has supposed that
the precipitate from astringent
juices by means of Muriate of
Tin consists of [deletion]the vegetable[/deletion]
Tannin & the oxide of Tin
or Tannin extract [deletion]or[/deletion]& the oxide
of Tin: & He proposed to obtain
pure Tannin from the precipitate
from Galls by [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] this salt.
- In examining the process
of precipitatation in [insertion]different[/insertion] cases when
the ingredients have been
mixed in various [deletion]different[/deletion] proportions
I have never found [deletion]in[/deletion]an excess
of acid in the residual fluid
when the muriate of Tin was
neutral; I found it after the
process giving [unclear]a[/unclear] precipitate with
the carbonate of Potash in minute
quantities the same as before.-
