sweet sounds; has the understanding
the peculiar attribute of
Man no objects of delight
no enjoyments; yes it
is the discovery
of [underline]truth[/underline]; the contemplation
of the Universe;-
The sublime pleasure of
understanding that which
others fear & of making
friends even of inanimate
objects.-
