Letter I. To Irmay. -
- pure nonsense. - to be hereafter
analised
A month is passed away, a month
of gloomy sorrow, of heartrending anguish
& of retrospective pleasure connected
by no existing link to futurity.-
I have suffered my friend, all
that humanity tormented by one
terrible passion [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] into which love
greif & disappointment modified
by no hope [insertion]enter in[/insertion] is capable of sustaining.
A solitary man given up to nature
admiring her in great & awful
forms or pursuing her in the
infinite littleness of minute combinations
My youth was spent in contemplating
in loving series of things, an
immense mass of energy existed in
my mind; but it was attached

to no simple forms, no single objects.
Accustomed to converse with books
I had learnt to sympathise but
little with audible sounds; but
the names of virtue, loveliness
& beauty were connected in my
mind with the strongest emotions -
persecuted & oppressed by the social
beings with whom I was intimately
connected, a kind word a gentle
sentiment an appearance of fondness
filled my heart with rapture
it called up the emotions of my
infancy , when love happiness &
enjoyment were strongly connected
with the human countenance -
Such was I when I beheld Aide
She was beautiful as the sky
brightened by the moon beams, She
was gentler than - the rise of the

It is in the anticipation of enjoyment that

from the strong emotion produced

We say that children & uncivilised

as to be connected with
eminently different terms-

I am not differently organised from other men
The History of my life contains no grand or

My manners proclaim me the solitary

perpetually warmed by the fire of love
& of friendship; but the objects of
my passion are ideal beings.-

them into new combinations I consider
myself as one of the feeble machines
destined to increase the general quantity

Introductory Lecture p[superscript]t[/superscript] 1[superscript]st[/superscript]
Nature of physical Science - peculiarity of
Chemistry.- [deletion][unclear]With[/unclear][/deletion] its foundation in the
facts of Nature, as an Art & [unclear]imitation[/unclear]
of Nature; [unclear]its[/unclear] a science the classifification
of the fa[deletion]ts[/deletion]cts of Nature & Art by means
of analogy & fact.
. The science of Nature relates to all
the changes taking place in the external
world.- Amongst these changes [deletion]all[/deletion] some are
evidently[deletion]ly[/deletion] [deletion]produced by connected with[/deletion] [insertion]produced[/insertion] by
motions [deletion]of[/deletion] in masses of matter; but others
owe their existence to [deletion]the p[/deletion] other
causes, & they are connected with
alterations in the forms & appearances
of bodies & with a destruction in
their individuality.- They are
the subjects of the Chemistry.
. Late in its origin but rapid in
its progress this Science has [insertion]at length[/insertion] assumed
a systematic form: Its objects are
determined its relations & [deletion]objects[/deletion]
dependencies acertained

[page]76|MS-DAVY-11510-000-00076|dnp15j074pp|71950133[/page]
The proportion as our instruments become
more perfect so in proportion is there more
of the Vast unknown in Nature laid open
to our investigation - Every new discovery
opens a sphere of activity - The Sciences that
had at first the sublime truths of
speculative discovery for their objects
though born in Heaven have their
resting place on Earth. They connect
together at length the scattered Arts
& they form into a whole the
scattered fragments of the Knowledge
of Man.
It has been said of physical science
in general that the ideas it gives
us are too definite; this is false
as to Chemistry for as it presents
to us a variety of unknown causes
it may be said to be [deletion][unclear]most[/unclear][/deletion]
almost indefinite.

The life of vegetables as compared with that of
Animals is extremely imperfect. The lowest class
of organised beings; their [deletion]functions[/deletion] [insertion]properties[/insertion] are considerably
influenced by common physical agencies; & though
governed by Laws distinct from the laws
of dead matter, they are connected by
very intimate relations with certain of
the changes produced by the common actions
of matter.
1
Incapable of locomotion & possessed of
no sensibility- In our minutest examination
of them We [deletion]perceive[/deletion] [insertion]are conscious[/insertion] only a [unclear]series[/unclear] of

as to the number & uses of their

relate to some simple fundamental
discovery; but the minuter parts of
the practises will always vary according
- to the caprices fashions or inventions
of different individuals.
- In taking a view of the Art
of Tanning or of combining skin
with the Tanning principle of
the vegetable Kingdom as practiced
in this country no set of operations
can appear more simple, yet
we shall find in a [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
examination of the History of

[page]86|MS-DAVY-11510-000-00086|dnp15j084pp|71950148[/page]
.The skins usually tanned may in respect
to their uses & the peculiarity of
the methods of preparing them be
divided into two kinds -
The first kind is [deletion]the larges[/deletion] cons[superscript]d[/superscript]
by the skins of large animals such as
Oxen, Cows Horses &c. & these are
called Hides
. The Skins of Calves Seals Dogs
&c constitute the second kind
of skins & these [deletion]is[/deletion]are commonly
applied for forming the upper
leathers of shoes [deletion]&[/deletion] the legs of
Boots &c & which are comparatively
thin & supple.-
There are two methods of [insertion]depilating[/insertion]
[deletion]tannin[/deletion] & of [deletion]preparing[/deletion] the hides of
thick skins for the purpose
of receiving the impression of
the tanning lixivium._ In the
one the chief agent is lime water
in the other incipient putrefaction
is employed. The lixivium for
preparing hides in whatever manner

after the filtration of the precipitate

it is exposed to the air &
if the alkali is in excess
affords no precipitate to
gelatine till an acid is added
to it.
- Solution of Carbonate of Soda
& of Ammoniac both precipitate
the solution of galls in a manner
similar to Potash._
- And in these processes it
appears that two compounds are
formed one containing excess
of Tannin & little alkali & gallic
acid which is [insertion]nearly[/insertion] insoluble
both in water & in alkali &
[insertion]which in consequence is precipitated[/insertion] the [deletion]the[/deletion] other contains excess
of alkali & much gallic acid
which is soluble but which

[page]92|MS-DAVY-11510-000-00092|dnp15j088pp|71950167[/page]
is not precipitable by gelatine-

y[superscript]e[/superscript] Carbonates of Ammoniac & Soda
are examined [insertion]after being well washed[/insertion] they are found
to contain alkali; & the

M[superscript]r[/superscript] Proust has observed that
many of the neutral salts precipitate
the solutions of galls & this [insertion]as in the [unclear]other[/unclear][/insertion] He
attributes to their combining with a [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear]
the water which held the Tannin

I have found that; Nitrate
of Potash, Acetate of Potash, Muriate

the salts produce copious
precipitates with galls; but these

[page]93|MS-DAVY-11510-000-00093|dnp15j089pp|71950170[/page]
89
precipitates are in general very
little soluble in water; & from
the examination of the products
given by their in cineration
I am inclined to beleive that
they are in all cases compounds
of [deletion]the[/deletion] Tannin with the saline
matters- The solutions after
the precipitate [insertion]is separated[/insertion] contain [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] gallic
acid & salt [deletion]in on[unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] with a
little Tannin & in most cases
when the salts are in great
excess they give very little as
the precipitate to gelatine.-

has been generally supposed that
these precipitates are composed

I have never found [deletion]in[/deletion]an excess

It is for the most part
soluble in water-- & a considerable

The strongest solution of
extract of Catechu that I could
obtain was of specific gravity
1.. & gave by evaporation
grains of solid matter, which
by analysis appeared to be
composed of Tannin; & the
remainder a peculiar vegetable
matter; soluble in water &
much more soluble in warm
water than in cold water &
which gave no precipitate to
gelatine & a very faint one
