As it may be supposed that some of my<lb/>

terms belonging to Geology and as most<lb/>
of these terms will appear Barbarous and<lb/>
are really difficult to be rememberd, I shall<lb/>
introduce them as gradually as possible<lb/>
beginning with the History of the Science<lb/>

In this History the early opinions of the<lb/>

the opinions that are complicated will<lb/>
follow those that are simple and distinct.<lb/>

This part of the subject I shall illustrate as<lb/>

conformable to the taste of the Age to<lb/>
amuse themselves with the visions of<lb/>
