Of all the material objects which can employ
[underline]our attention those which are nearest to us[/underline]
ought to excite the warmest and the most
[underline]immediate interest[/underline].
And after Man and animated Nature no
subject of physical enquiry nears a more
disinct relation to us than [underline]the place of[/underline]
[underline]our abode[/underline] the earth which is the cradle
of [underline]our existance[/underline] which affords the instrume[insertion]nts[/insertion]
of our power; and which thought not
the [underline]great parent[/underline] is the peaceful and
[underline]useful nurse[/underline] of some of the most constant
and uniform of our pleasures -
