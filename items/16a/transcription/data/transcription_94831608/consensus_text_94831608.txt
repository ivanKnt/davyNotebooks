The study of the constitution of the Globe
of the manner in which its changes are
produced and of the laws by which dead
and inorganic matter are rendered
subservient to the purposes of living
beings affords some of the most [underline]sublime[/underline]
[underline]objects[/underline]which can ever occupy our
contemplation.
The are objects which even the most
[underline]insensible mind[/underline] can scarcely consider without
deep feeling -
And they are capable of filling even the
most comprehensive understanding and of
calling forth the highest exertions
of Genius.-
