The attainment of the Knowledge belonging to
these highly interesting [underline]subjects is found[/underline]
almost wholly upon [underline]observation[/underline]; for in a
few cases only can instruments of experiment
[underline]be applied[/underline].
And the [underline]acquaintance[/underline] with mineral bodies
which constitutes one of the most labourious
and most interesting of [underline]the study[/underline] may in
almost every case be derived from an
[underline]examination[/underline] of their [underline]external characters.[/underline]
Geology perhaps more than any other departm
of Natural Philosophy is a [underline]science[/underline] of 
contemplation.-
