The most sublime speculations are
awakened, the present is disregarded
past ages crowd upon the fancy and the
the mind is lost in admiration of the
designs of that great power who has
established order in which at first view
appears as confusion -
It will not I trust be necessary to
preserve these views to any greater extent.
For sufficient I hope has been said
to prove that the study is adapted to
almost every mind and that any labour
which may be bestowed upon it can
scarcely be considered as vain.-
