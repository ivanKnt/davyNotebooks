The task which I have preposed to my self in
explaining all those various objects is one
which in this Country I beleive has never
been before [underline]undertaken[/underline] and it is one connected
with much labour and with many difficulties -

different facts from very distant and very
scattered sources -
It is a subject in which very few only
of its parts will admit of the arrangement
[underline]of language[/underline] of beauty of description of elegance
of expression. I shall spare no exertions to
make it useful and [underline]intelligible[/underline]:
