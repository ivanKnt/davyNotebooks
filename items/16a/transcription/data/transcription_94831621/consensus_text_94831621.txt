In all the earliest systems of religions of the
heathen Nations that have come down to the
present times either by history or tradition
certain doctrines are uniformly found relating
to the formation of the [underline]Earth and its early[/underline]
[underline]changes[/underline] -
And most of these doctrines appear to have
been in some manner derived from the grand
account of the [underline]creation[/underline] and of the [underline]deluge[/underline]
delivered in the sacred writings -
The cosmogony of the Hindoes offers a
remarkable instance and is quoted as such
by Sir W[superscript]m[superscript] Jones from the account of the
formation of the universe supposed to be given
by Manu the Son of Brama to the Indian
Sages.-
