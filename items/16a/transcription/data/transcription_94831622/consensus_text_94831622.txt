The World, says He was all darkness undiscernible
undistinguishable altogether as in a profound
sleep still the self existing invisible God
making it manifest with five elements and
other glorious forms perfectly dispelled the
gloom.
He desiring to raise up various creatures
by an emanation from his own glory first
created the waters, and impressed them
with a power of motion - by that power
was produced a golden Egg blazing like a
thousand Suns on which was borm Brama
self [deletion]ex[/deletion] existing the greatest parent of all
national beings.
