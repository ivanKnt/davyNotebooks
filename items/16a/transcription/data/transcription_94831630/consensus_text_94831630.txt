Almighty give the first the last
The present future and the past
Source of all existing things
[underline]From thee[/underline] created being springs
From thee the heavens derive their birth
From thee arose the solid Earth
From thee the radiant solar light
From thee the stars that gild the night
Thine is the morning changeful hue
Thine is the ether bright and blue
Thine is the warmth of summer days
Thine is the [deletion]Air[/deletion] land the Air the seas
Thy substance is our vital breath
Thy [underline]spirit raises life[/underline] from death
