Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls
And Peals on Peals redoubled rend the poles
Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground
The forests wave, the mountains nod [deletion]aronnd[/deletion][insertion]around[/insertion]
From all their summits tremble Idas woods
And from their sources boil her hundred floods
Troys turrets totter on the rocking plain,
And the tossed navies beat the heavy Main
Deep in the dismal regions of the dead
The infernal monarch reared his horned [insertion]head[/insertion]
Sprung from his throne lest Neptunes [insertion]arm should lay[/insertion]
His dark dominions open to the Day.
