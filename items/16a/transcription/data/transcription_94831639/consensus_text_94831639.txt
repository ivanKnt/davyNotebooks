Hence those who dwell either on mounta[insertion]ins[/insertion]
or  lofty and dry places perish more
abundantly than such as dwell near
rivers or on the borders of the sea
To us indeed the hill is both salutary
in this respect and in others and it preserves
us from such devastations
Again when the Gods purifying the
Earth by water deluges its surface then
the herdsmen and shepherds inhabiting
the Mountains are preserved while the
people of [underline]your[/underline] cities are hurried away
to the sea by the impetuous inundations
of rivers.-
