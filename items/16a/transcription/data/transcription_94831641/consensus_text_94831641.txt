But what ever has been transacted
either by us or by you or in any other
place; beautiful or grand or wonderful
is to be found in our temples preserved
to the present day -
While on the contrary you and other
nations commit only recent transactions to
writing and the other inventions which
society has employed for transmitting
information
And hence when at stated periods of time
these changes ordained by heaven as if diseases
of nature destroys them among you who survive
are both destitute of literary acquisitions and
the inspiration of the muses -
