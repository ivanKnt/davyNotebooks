The doctrines of Anaxemander were taught
after his death by his scholar Anaximenes ,
who made many additions and ventured to
contradict generally the principles of Thales
and to assert that Air and [underline]not water [/underline] is the
chief material element and that water is
capable of being composed from Air adducing
as a proof that by the condensation of Air
rain is [underline]produced[/underline] which when congealed becomes
snow or hail appearing then as it were a
[underline]species of[/underline] Earth -
But the greatest of the Philosophers of
the early school was Anaxagorus who
flourished in about 450 years before Christ
