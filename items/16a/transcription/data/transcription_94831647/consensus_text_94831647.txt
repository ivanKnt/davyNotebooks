Born at Clazomene. He soon removed to [underline] Athens[/underline]
where He taught Philosophy for thirty years
till He was banished from this celebrated
City from the mere circumstance of his asserting
that the sun [underline]was material[/underline] and a mass of
ignited substance.-
Anaxagorous taught that one supreme
intelligence was the creator and governour of
the world.
And Hence he was honoured with the title of
[unclear]Noss[/unclear] or the Mind and thus Timon speaks
of him in verses quoted by Laertius which
I have thus translated.-
He spoke of one eternal living mind
That all this glorious universe designed
And from compassion made it rise and shine
In order and in harmony divine.-
