Geology Lecture 1st 1805
So different are the exertions of the faculties
of the mind, and so infinitely various the
combinations of our ideas & [underline]that the same[/underline]
[underline]objects[/underline] may be examined with the most opposite
views and considered under many diversified
and beautiful relations.-
It is on this fact of our nature so familiar
to every understanding that the great extent [deletion]of[/deletion]
and progression of science and philosophy depend -
Hence their division into various branches and
hence the [deletion]distinguished[/deletion] distinctness and
accuracy of the different species of [underline]Knowledge[/underline]

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00004|dnp16a02pp|94831596[/page]
The Planet that we inhabit may be considered in
its connection with the general system of
the universe, as acted upon gravitation and
revolving round the sun -
It may be examined in the abode of
organization and life covered with vegetables
and peopled with animals, - or it may be
studied as composed of different inorganic [underline]parts[/underline]
variously arranged and subservient to different
uses.-
It is under this last point of [underline]view[/underline] that it
is the subject of [underline]Geology[/underline] - The Word is derived
from [underline]the Greek language[/underline] it signifies the
[underline]Science of the Earth[/underline], but its acceptation is
limited and it is only [deletion]app[/deletion] applied to
the [underline]branch of Knowledge[/underline] relating to

[page]5|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00005|dnp16a03pp|94831597[/page]
The nature position and changes of the bodies
that compose the [underline]known part[/underline] of the surface
of the Globe.
The facts belonging to [underline]Geology[/underline] are numerous
The objects of the study are as many as the
substances found in our soils our Rocks and
our Mountains in the Sea and in the Atmosphere
And the alterations that those great parts
of our system are continually undergoin
can only be explained on the principles of
this department of Philosophy.-
The information to be derived from Geology
is applicable to many purposes - In a number
of instances it may be made subservient to the
wants of life And all the theoretical views
belonging to it when accurately pursued lead to
beautiful [underline]truths[/underline].-
substances found in our [unclear]vain[/unclear] our Rocks and

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00006|dnp16a04pp|94831598[/page]
Fixed [underline]on the earth[/underline] and dependent for our
existance upon the various objects surrounding us
Many of our necessities are supplied and some
of our comforts produced by applications of
the inorganic substances presented to us in
Nature.-
The soils from which we raise our vegetative
nourishment the stones of which our habitations
[underline]are formed[/underline] the fuel we employ for so many
purposes and the metals [underline]absolutely essential[/underline]
[underline]to civilized Man[/underline] are all subjects for the
application [underline]of Geology[/underline]
And it is not merely [underline]their nature[/underline] which
is indicated by this science but methods
of discovering them and their [underline]extensive relations[/underline]

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00007|dnp16a05pp|94831599[/page]
The rocks and stoney substances which are
found beneath the soil, or which compose
the foundations of our Hills though so various
in their appearances yet contain many common
substances.-
The same bodies are found in very distant Countries
There is an order in their position and the
general nature of the mineral bodies belonging
to a particular district, is in most cases
indicated by the examination of a few
specimens -
In a mountainous country for instance
if a stone of this nature occurs which is
[underline]granite[/underline] there is great reason to suppose
that this [underline]substance[/underline] will be likewise [deletion]found[/deletion]

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00008|dnp16a06pp|94831600[/page]
found at no great distance but in such
a [underline]position[/underline] it would be vain to search for
shell limestone or [underline]for Coal[/underline]
A gain (when shell limestone is found there
is a strong [underline]presumption[/underline] that soft-black
slate or loose sandstone will likewise occur
in some contiguous spot and in such
a country there can be little doubt that
at some depth or in some direction
[underline]pit coal[/underline] would exist.-
These circumstances which are [deletion]fundamental[/deletion]
fundamental facts of the science prove in
a strong manner that considerable
discoveries may often result from Geological

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00009|dnp16a07pp|94831601[/page]
Knowledge and that it affords information
capable of being immediately brought into use -
The person who is diggin for [underline]pit Coal[/underline]
when He meets beneath the soil granite Rocks
if acquainted with the arrangement of
and nature of Strata will be immediately
instructed to give over his labour and
to spare useless expence.
But should He find [underline]sandstone[/underline] a substance
which to an uninstructed eye appears much
of the same nature as granite, it affords
him immediate encouragement to proceed
in his researches -

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00010|dnp16a08pp|94831602[/page]
And a yellow of red [underline]sandstone[/underline] on a
soft slate bearing the impression of Vegetable
leaves would offer indications almost certain
of the substances sought for.
For these Rocks are generally immediately
incumbent on Coal.-
Similar reasoning may be applied to [underline]metallic[/underline]
[underline]veins[/underline].
The metals seldom or never occur in
rocks of serpentine or sienite or in soft coaly
shist nor in sandstone nor in Basalt
but they may be looked for in soft granite
in hard shist in hard shell limestone.
And if in granite or shist a vein
of white stone is found remaining in

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00011|dnp16a09pp|94831603[/page]
a direction from East to west there is much
probability that in some part of its depth
it may afford useful metal.
And if veins [underline]of spar[/underline] occur in Rocks partly
hollow and partly filled with a yellow
substance of this kind which in Cornwall
is called Gossan it may be always concluded
that these veins will be productive and the
larger the quantity of Gossan the better 
the indication.
A number of Instances of the same
kind might be [underline]adduced[/underline] the study of the
science is not [underline]useful merely[/underline] to the [underline]Miner[/underline]
for as it explains the general Direction
of Strata and the substances they contain

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00012|dnp16a10pp|94831604[/page]
[underline]it offers[/underline] applications to many more [underline]of the Arts[/underline]
of life.
It ought to be studied by the engineer who
is employed in the construction of Canals; as
certain [underline]strata [/underline] exceedingly hard are often with
others very soft and easily cut through.-
The drainer in order to make his operations
successful ought to be minutely acquainted
with the [underline]arrangement [/underline] of the rocks in the
district from which the [underline]springs arise[/underline] that
[underline]it is[/underline] his business to divert -
And the improver of land may often
derive from Geology very useful instructions
with regard to [underline]limestone[/underline], marble, Clayes 
their application and the nearest places
whence they [underline]may be procured[/underline].

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00013|dnp16a11pp|94831605[/page]
It is according to these [deletion]veiws[/deletion] views that the
study may be of National as well as of particul[insertion]ar[/insertion]
advantage -
Such reasons shew that it is highly worthy of
being [underline]pursued[/underline] - and there are other
reasons of no less importance though [underline]less[/underline]
[underline]obvious and more refined[/underline] which ought [underline]not[/underline]
[underline]to be slighted[/underline] in treating [underline]of its relations[/underline]
and general influence.
[underline]These reasons[/underline] will appear indeed perhaps
[underline]more precisely[/underline] [underline]to general Enquiries after inform[/underline][insertion]ation[/insertion]
for they depend upon circumstances which
can [underline]scarcely fail[/underline] to be equally interesting
to every refined understanding -

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00014|dnp16a12pp|94831606[/page]
It will be needless to enter upon a subject
which has been often discharged in [underline]this[/underline]
[underline]room[/underline].
The general usefulness [underline]of the Knowledge[/underline]
[underline]of Nature[/underline] in increasing [underline]mental enjoyment[/underline]
and in strengthening and exalting our
sentiments -
[underline]But it[/underline] surely will not be deemed improper
to point out some of the peculiar
intellectual effects of the objects of [underline]these[/underline]
[underline]Lectures [/underline]and some of the advantages of
the study as compared with that of other
branches of science -

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00015|dnp16a13pp|94831607[/page]
[deletion]of all[/deletion]
Of all the material objects which can employ
[underline]our attention those which are nearest to us[/underline]
ought to excite the warmest and the most
[underline]immediate interest[/underline].
And after Man and animated Nature no
subject of physical enquiry nears a more
disinct relation to us than [underline]the place of[/underline]
[underline]our abode[/underline] the earth which is the cradle
of [underline]our existance[/underline] which affords the instrume[insertion]nts[/insertion]
of our power; and which thought not
the [underline]great parent[/underline] is the peaceful and
[underline]useful nurse[/underline] of some of the most constant
and uniform of our pleasures -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00016|dnp16a14pp|94831608[/page]
The study of the constitution of the Globe
of the manner in which its changes are
produced and of the laws by which dead
and inorganic matter are rendered
subservient to the purposes of living
beings affords some of the most [underline]sublime[/underline]
[underline]objects[/underline]which can ever occupy our
contemplation.
The are objects which even the most
[underline]insensible mind[/underline] can scarcely consider without
deep feeling -
And they are capable of filling even the
most comprehensive understanding and of
calling forth the highest exertions
of Genius.-

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00017|dnp16a15pp|94831609[/page]
The Rocks which are elevated in the
clouds [underline]or those[/underline] which resist the [underline]waves of[/underline]
[underline]the sea[/underline] their composition the [underline]laws of their[/underline]
[underline]formation [/underline]and their alterations in consequence
of the action of the [underline]Atmosphere and of [/underline]
[underline]water[/underline]these form only a part of the
subjects of discussion of Geology -
For this Science equally relates to the
[underline]Nature[/underline] of soils [insertion][deletion]of all [insertion]the[/insertion] solid[/deletion][/insertion][deletion]strata of our Earth [/deletion]
of all the solid strata [underline]of our Earth[/underline]
to the [underline]gradual[/underline]changes produced by the Ocean 
upon [underline]the land[/underline] and to the great [underline]convulsions[/underline]
of [underline]Nature[/underline]occasioned by innundations, by Volcanoes
and by [underline]Earthquakes[/underline] -

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00018|dnp16a16pp|94831610[/page]
The attainment of the Knowledge belonging to
these highly interesting [underline]subjects is found[/underline]
almost wholly upon [underline]observation[/underline]; for in a
few cases only can instruments of experiment
[underline]be applied[/underline].
And the [underline]acquaintance[/underline] with mineral bodies
which constitutes one of the most labourious
and most interesting of [underline]the study[/underline] may in
almost every case be derived from an
[underline]examination[/underline] of their [underline]external characters.[/underline]
Geology perhaps more than any other departm
of Natural Philosophy is a [underline]science[/underline] of 
contemplation.-

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00019|dnp16a17pp|94831611[/page]
It requires no experience or complicated
apparatus no minute processes upon the
unknown properties of matter; It demands
only an enquiring [underline]mind[/underline]; and senses alive
to the facts almost every where presented
in [underline]Nature[/underline];
And as it may be acquired without
much difficulty so it may be improved
without [underline]much painful[/underline] exertion -
The person who is devoted to [underline]Geological [/underline]
enquiries can scarcely ever want objects
of employment and of interest.
The ground on which He treads, the Country
that [underline]surround Him [/underline]and even the Rocks
and stones removed from their natural

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00020|dnp16a18pp|94831612[/page]
position by Art are all capable of
affording him some degree of amusement
and every new mine or Quarry that is
opened every new surface of [underline]the earth[/underline]
[underline]is laid bare[/underline] and every new Country [underline]that[/underline]
[underline]is discovered[/underline] offers to him novel sources
of information.
[underline]In[/underline] travelling He is attracted to a pursuit
which must constantly preserve his mind
awake to the scenes presented to it.-
And the beauty the Majesty and sublimity
of the great forms of Nature have their
effect in the imagination rather increased.

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00021|dnp16a19pp|94831613[/page]
Than diminished by beings connected
with the views of [underline]Philosophy[/underline] -
The imagery of a Mountain Country
which is the very theatre of the science
is in almost all cass highly impressive
and delightful but a new and a higher
species of enjoyment arises in the mind
when the arrangement in it, their harmony
and its subserviency to the purposes
[underline]of life are considered[/underline].
To the Geological enquirer every
mountain chain offers striking Monuments
of the great alterations that the Globe
has undergone.

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00022|dnp16a20pp|94831614[/page]
The most sublime speculations are
awakened, the present is disregarded
past ages crowd upon the fancy and the
the mind is lost in admiration of the
designs of that great power who has
established order in which at first view
appears as confusion -
It will not I trust be necessary to
preserve these views to any greater extent.
For sufficient I hope has been said
to prove that the study is adapted to
almost every mind and that any labour
which may be bestowed upon it can
scarcely be considered as vain.-

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00023|dnp16a21pp|94831615[/page]
A very few words will be sufficient to
explain the plan which is my intention
to adopt in [underline]develloping the principles[/underline]
[underline]of the Science[/underline], and in rendering them
plain and intelligible.-
As it may be supposed that some of my
hearers are unacquainted with many of the
terms belonging to Geology and as most
of these terms will appear Barbarous and
are really difficult to be rememberd, I shall
introduce them as gradually as possible
beginning with the History of the Science

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00024|dnp16a22pp|94831616[/page]
In this History the early opinions of the
ancients concerning the elements of the
Globe and their changes will first
be discussed; and the more refined [underline]Theories [/underline]
of the Moderns which involve the outline
of the science will be [underline]afterwards [/underline]
[underline]considered[/underline], and in the general details
the opinions that are complicated will
follow those that are simple and distinct.
After the History of the Science the [underline]general [/underline]
[underline]order [/underline]of the facts belonging to it [underline]will be explained [/underline]
the Nature of Rocks ans stones; and the relations
of the different strata; and the changes that
they are at present undergoing -

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00025|dnp16a23pp|94831617[/page]
This part of the subject I shall illustrate as
much as possible by large specimens by drawing 
and by picturesque sketches of the position of Rocks.
From this last method much useful information
it is my hope, [underline]may be derived[/underline].
This painting will show the nature of the
plan to be adopted.
From the liberality of the Managers I shall
be able to exhibit a number of the same kind
and on the same scale and most of them
will contain accurate portraits which will
be the more interesting as belonging to the
Island we inhabit.-
After having examined the existing state
of [underline]the Globe[/underline]
The last subject of the course will be
the [deletion]description [/deletion] discussion of the Theories

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00026|dnp16a24pp|94831618[/page]
that have been formed [underline]to explain[/underline] the
Nature and position of [underline]its parts[/underline]. The
laws of their formation and the changes
that they have undergone in the lapse
of ages; and the principles and order
by which the whole is continually preserved.
It is this department of the science which
will perhaps be [underline]the most interesting[/underline].
It is the one that offers the greatest objects
of contemplation - It has most employed
[underline]human ingenuity[/underline]: and many of the Theories
and speculations upon it exhibit brilliant
examples of the most powerful [deletion]gen[/deletion]
efforts of Genius -

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00027|dnp16a25pp|94831619[/page]
The task which I have preposed to my self in
explaining all those various objects is one
which in this Country I beleive has never
been before [underline]undertaken[/underline] and it is one connected
with much labour and with many difficulties -
As yet no elementary treatise has been published
on Geology I have been obliged to form any
part of the arrangement and to collect the
different facts from very distant and very
scattered sources -
It is a subject in which very few only
of its parts will admit of the arrangement
[underline]of language[/underline] of beauty of description of elegance
of expression. I shall spare no exertions to
make it useful and [underline]intelligible[/underline]:

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00028|dnp16a26pp|94831620[/page]
And in mentioning these circumstances
I mean to apologise only for imperfections
that cannot be avoided -
The [underline]History of Geology[/underline] is a subject
that necessarily leads us to consider the state
of the human mind even in the elder
periods of time.
[underline]Man[/underline] in his most [deletion]savvage[/deletion] savage must
have been strongly impressed with the
forms, appearances and changes of the
[underline]Earth and its diversified[/underline] objects -
And some of his earliest reasonings directed
from effects to causes must have been connected
with speculations on unknown times or [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
alterations of matter and on the [underline]wonders of [deletion]Nature[/deletion][/underline][insertion]creation[/insertion]

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00029|dnp16a27pp|94831621[/page]
In all the earliest systems of religions of the
heathen Nations that have come down to the
present times either by history or tradition
certain doctrines are uniformly found relating
to the formation of the [underline]Earth and its early[/underline]
[underline]changes[/underline] -
And most of these doctrines appear to have
been in some manner derived from the grand
account of the [underline]creation[/underline] and of the [underline]deluge[/underline]
delivered in the sacred writings -
The cosmogony of the Hindoes offers a
remarkable instance and is quoted as such
by Sir W[superscript]m[/superscript] Jones from the account of the
formation of the universe supposed to be given
by Manu the Son of Brama to the Indian
Sages.-

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00030|dnp16a28pp|94831622[/page]
[unclear]D[/unclear]
The World, says He was all darkness undiscernible
undistinguishable altogether as in a profound
sleep still the self existing invisible God
making it manifest with five elements and
other glorious forms perfectly dispelled the
gloom.
He desiring to raise up various creatures
by an emanation from his own glory first
created the waters, and impressed them
with a power of motion - by that power
was produced a golden Egg blazing like a
thousand Suns on which was borm Brama
self [deletion]ex[/deletion] existing the greatest parent of all
national beings.

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00031|dnp16a29pp|94831623[/page]
To an unprejudiced enquirer this passage
must appear as a paraphase of the more
simple and more sublime detail of the
inspired writer -
In the beginning God created the heavens
and the Earth and the Earth was without form
and void and darkness was upon the face
of the deep and the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters and God said
let there be light and light was.-
The Early Egyptian [underline]Cosmogony[/underline] according to a
late ingenious writer Cap[superscript]t[/superscript] Wilford is very
similar to that of the Hindous and is probably
derived from the same source; though the
account of it is less distinct -

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00032|dnp16a30pp|94831624[/page]
[unclear]Cre[/unclear] or the supreme being is supposed in
their mythology to be the one Author of
being and the father of Osiris or the
[underline]Sun[/underline] the object of adoration who is imaged
as [deletion]issuing[/deletion] the form of light from an
[underline]Egg the first of created beings[/underline]
Amongst nations disposed to [underline]polytheism[/underline]
the great tradition and primary doctrine
must soon have been blended with a
number of [underline]opinions and dogmas[/underline] arising
from the condition and peculiar [underline]circumstances[/underline]
[underline]of society[/underline]:-

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00033|dnp16a31pp|94831625[/page]
And new reasonings concerning the universe
its productions the elements of matter and
the causes of things must have been
constantly awakened in the mind.-
To common understandings alive to the
impressions of superstition it is easy to conceive
that all natural objects connected with strong
feeling would readily be referred to some
unknown divine power and hence the
different parts of [underline]Nature represented[/underline] in an
extensive mythology -
And facts [underline]prove that[/underline] in nations the most
[underline]distant[/underline] this [deletion]nr[/deletion]has actually taken place
and in a similar manner;-

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00034|dnp16a32pp|94831626[/page]
This [underline]the winds[/underline] have been personified
Fire one of the most beneficial as
well as one of the most powerful material
agents has been worshiped under different
symbols in almost every part of the
ancient world:[deletion](and[/deletion]
And that [underline]power[/underline] supposed to be [underline]individual[/underline]
which raises water from the ocean and
causes it to fall upon the land giving
vigour to the plant and the animal
has been equally adored in India
[deletion]Eygspt[/deletion] Egypt and Greece In India
as Iswara and Leia In Egypt as Isis
and in Greece as that celestial Venus

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00035|dnp16a33pp|94831627[/page]
who is represented as rising from the bosom
of the ocean [deletion]clothed[/deletion] cloathed in loveliness the
the parent of beauty and the preserver
of life -
Long before [underline]men[/underline] had examined the
x
present they endeavoured to reason concerning
the past and to predict [underline]concerning the[/underline]
[underline]future[/underline]
The imagination is always more active
than the reason in an [underline]early state of society[/underline]
The first person who professed to teach others
attempted to combine the characters of the
Poet of the Philosopher of the Priest and
the only profane records of the opinions
of early ages that have been transmitted

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00036|dnp16a34pp|94831628[/page]
to the present time are adorned with the
language of passion and cloaked with
the graces of the fancy.
The Greeks have represented the Bards
as their first instructors -
The names of Cinus of orpheus and of
museus are celebrated by their earliest
[underline]Historians[/underline]: and the Hymns of orpheus if
they be admitted to be [underline]genuine[/underline] contain
some general expressions of facts with
[underline]regard to Nature[/underline] and the powers acting
in Nature, which [underline]are very admirable[/underline]
and which could scarcely be expected
in so early an age.-

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00037|dnp16a35pp|94831629[/page]
this Hymn to jupiter is filled with
beautiful poetry and with some [deletion]compreh [insertion]ension[/insertion][/deletion]
comprehensive truths [underline]concerning the[/underline]
[underline]production[/underline] of things and [underline]the cause[/underline]
[underline]of their[/underline] relations and order
I have made a free translation of it
which [underline]I shall venture to read[/underline].
The original even if its high antiquity
be doubted will at least be found
impressive from its views -

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00038|dnp16a36pp|94831630[/page]
Almighty [person]person_795|jove[/person] the first the last
The present future and the past
Source of all existing things
[underline]From thee[/underline] created being springs
From thee the heavens derive their birth
From thee arose the solid Earth
From thee the radiant solar light
From thee the stars that gild the night
Thine is the morning changeful hue
Thine is the ether bright and blue
Thine is the warmth of summer days
Thine is the [deletion]Air[/deletion] land the Air the seas
Thy substance is our vital breath
Thy [underline]spirit raises life[/underline] from death

In the [unclear]Theogony[/unclear] of Hesiod as has been
observed by the great [person]person_324|Bacon[/person] there is evidently
much allegorical description which may be
supposed to apply to the constitution and [underline]changes[/underline]
[underline]of the Earth[/underline] but so many explanations of the
same fables may be given that any attempt
at accurate decyphering would be wholly
vain -
It would be wandering in a labyrinth
without end not for the sake of discovering truth
but merely with a view of detecting [underline]error[/underline]
The poems of Homer evidently composed at
a time when the dawn of civilization was
opening upon the [underline]human mind[/underline] contain [deletion]infinitely[/deletion]
infinitely more facts relating to Man than
to Nature and however great the extent

to which mythology had been applied before
his time in explaining the phenomenon of
the universe it is chiefly made in the
[underline]Iliad[/underline] and the odyssey the Machinery for
exiting the interest and [underline]awakening[/underline]
[underline]attention [/underline] to the [underline]actions of Heroes and of Men[/underline]
Occasionally indeed the physical attributes
of the Gods occur -
And Jupiter is represented as the power
that acts in the Air, Neptune as
the moving forces of the waters and
[underline]Pluto[/underline]as the principle residing in

Thus in the battle in the [unclear]20 book[/unclear] -

Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls
And Peals on Peals redoubled rend the poles
Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground
The forests wave, the mountains nod [deletion]aronnd[/deletion][insertion]around[/insertion]
From all their summits tremble Idas woods
And from their sources boil her hundred floods
Troys turrets totter on the rocking plain,
And the tossed navies beat the heavy Main
Deep in the dismal regions of the dead
The infernal monarch reared his horned [insertion]head[/insertion]
Sprung from his throne lest Neptunes [insertion]arm should lay[/insertion]
His dark dominions open to the Day.

The first accurate accounts of the general
Philosophical opinions of the Elder Nations
concerning the universe freed from the
mysteries of mythology and from poetic
fables are those delivered to us in the
History of the philosophical schools of Greece.
At the era however of the foundation
of the Grecian Republics science was far
from being indigenous in that happy
Country: and both the legislators and
philosophers were obliged to travel into
foreign lands in quest of information
Egypt as we are instructed by Herodotus
and by various other Authorities was the

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00043|dnp16a41pp|94831635[/page]
great nurse of Grecian Science and the
opinions of the first European Sages are
said to have been modifications of the
doctrine of the Egyptian [underline]Priests[/underline] -
Of [underline]these doctrines[/underline] in their pure and
[underline]esoteric[/underline] form very few documents remain
and by the fertile imaginations of the
Greeks they were soon blended with their
own opinions
Water it is said they considered as the
great and active element the cause of the
changes of the Globe and the reproduction
of life -
[underline]Fire likewise[/underline] they regarded as a principle
And Air as a modification of water and fire

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00044|dnp16a42pp|94831636[/page]
In the [underline]Timeas of Plato[/underline] the opinions
[deletion]the[/deletion] of an Egyptian Sage are detailed as
it is supposed they were delivered to Solon
at Sais -
From them Plato acknowledge that He
borrowed the idea of the Atlantis fable
and they are so very singular and contain
so many opinions different from those
of the Greeks concerning Nature and
the changes [underline]of the Globe[/underline] that I shall
a translation of the most interesting part
You Greeks says the Egyptian
Philosopher to Solon -

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00045|dnp16a43pp|94831637[/page]
You Greeks are always Children nor is
there an experienced man amongst you -
All your knowledge is lately acquired
Neither containing any antient opinion
derived from remote tradition nor any
truth of ages that are long past.
And the reason of this is the multitude
and variety of the destructions of the human
[underline]race which[/underline] have been [underline]and which[/underline] will be
The greatest of these indeed arising from
fire and water, but the lesser from ten
thousand other contingencies.
For the relations subsisting among you

of his [underline]Father and not being able to[/underline]
[underline]keep the track pointed out to him [/underline]
burnt up [underline]the substances[/underline] belonging to
the Earth and perished himself, blasted
by thunder is indeed considered
as fabulous: yet it is in reality true.
For it expresses the mutations of the
bodies revolving in the Heavens above
the earth: and indicates that after
long periods of time a [underline]destruction[/underline]
of terrestrial nature ensues from [underline]the[/underline]
[underline]devastation of fire[/underline].
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear] those who dwell either on [/deletion]
[deletion]Mountains or lofty [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00047|dnp16a45pp|94831639[/page]
Hence those who dwell either on mounta[insertion]ins[/insertion]
or  lofty and dry places perish more
abundantly than such as dwell near
rivers or on the borders of the sea
To us indeed the hill is both salutary
in this respect and in others and it preserves
us from such devastations
Again when the Gods purifying the
Earth by water deluges its surface then
the herdsmen and shepherds inhabiting
the Mountains are preserved while the
people of [underline]your[/underline] cities are hurried away
to the sea by the impetuous inundations
of rivers.-

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00048|dnp16a46pp|94831640[/page]
On the contrary in our region neither
[deletion]how[/deletion] then nor at any other time did
the water [underline]descending from above pour[/underline]
with desolation on the plains but they
naturally rise upwards from the bosom of
the earth:
And from these causes the most
antient traditions are preserved in our
country -
Indeed it may be truly asserted that
in the places where neither intense cold
nor immoderate heat prevails the race
of Mankind is always preserved. though
sometimes the number of individuals is
increased and sometimes diminished -

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00049|dnp16a47pp|94831641[/page]
But what ever has been transacted
either by us or by you or in any other
place; beautiful or grand or wonderful
is to be found in our temples preserved
to the present day -
While on the contrary you and other
nations commit only recent transactions to
writing and the other inventions which
society has employed for transmitting
information
And hence when at stated periods of time
these changes ordained by heaven as if diseases
of nature destroys them among you who survive
are both destitute of literary acquisitions and
the inspiration of the muses -

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00050|dnp16a48pp|94831642[/page]
Hence it happens that you become
again as it were an infant people
and ignorant of the events which
happened in ancient times whether in
foreign lands or in your own [underline]Country[/underline]
Of the Grecian Philosophers Thales the
[underline]Miletian[/underline] is the first whose opinions
concerning the earth we have any
authentic documents -
He is said by Apollodorous to have
flourished about 600 years before [underline]Christ[/underline]
His principle physical doctrine was
that which has been before mentioned
as derived from Egypt that water was

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00051|dnp16a49pp|94831643[/page]
the principle of all things -
And that being set in motion by the
[underline]supreme cause[/underline] , the earth and all the
forms of being proceeded from it -
[underline]Anaximander[/underline] the countryman and disciple
of [underline]Thales, [/underline] as there is every reason to believe
went far beyond his master in the study
of Nature -
He considered an infinite cause as the
creator and mover of matter
He supposed that though the parts of the
world are continually changing the whole
is neverthless [underline]immutable[/underline] -

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00052|dnp16a50pp|94831644[/page]
He developed, if one may believe[deletion]plutarch[/deletion]
plutarch, what is now known to be
the true causes of the winds that is to
say a motion and change of place
in the Air produced in consequence
of the rarefaction of its lower parts
by the solar Heat -
Some of the opinions of Anaximander
concerning the great bodies of the
universe are exceedingly curious
He is said to have advanced that
the Sun is 28 times[deletion]big[/deletion] as great
as the earth In [deletion]his[/deletion] his age such
an opinion was exceedingly

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00053|dnp16a51pp|94831645[/page]
extraordinary but we should give him
more credit for it if He had not said
that the moon was 29 times [underline] as large [/underline] -
He conceived that the sun it self
was not luminous but that its light
[deletion]proceeded[/deletion]proceeded from a hollow circle
surrounding it -
This idea might at first view be
conceived to be very similar to that of
a celebrated modern [underline]Philosopher[/underline]. but
the similarity [underline]will disappear[/underline] when it is
stated that the Greek considered the [deletion]Elip[/deletion]
Eclipses of the Sun as owing to the
closing up of the orifices in the circle
necessary for emitting light -

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00054|dnp16a52pp|94831646[/page]
The doctrines of Anaxemander were taught
after his death by his scholar Anaximenes ,
who made many additions and ventured to
contradict generally the principles of Thales
and to assert that Air and [underline]not water [/underline] is the
chief material element and that water is
capable of being composed from Air adducing
as a proof that by the condensation of Air
rain is [underline]produced[/underline] which when congealed becomes
snow or hail appearing then as it were a
[underline]species of[/underline] Earth -
But the greatest of the Philosophers of
the early school was Anaxagorus who
flourished in about 450 years before Christ

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00055|dnp16a53pp|94831647[/page]
Born at Clazomene. He soon removed to [underline] Athens[/underline]
where He taught Philosophy for thirty years
till He was banished from this celebrated
City from the mere circumstance of his asserting
that the sun [underline]was material[/underline] and a mass of
ignited substance.-
Anaxagorous taught that one supreme
intelligence was the creator and governour of
the world.
And Hence he was honoured with the title of
[unclear]Noss[/unclear] or the Mind and thus Timon speaks
of him in verses quoted by Laertius which
I have thus translated.-
He spoke of one eternal living mind
That all this glorious universe designed
And from compassion made it rise and shine
In order and in harmony divine.-

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00056|dnp16a54pp|94831648[/page]
One of the most novel and the most remarkable
of the doctrines of Anaxagorus was that He
considered all bodies as composed of similar
parts or essences; and that if the ultimate
figure of particles could be obtained they
would be found [underline]precisely similar [/underline] to the original
body which they composed -
This philosopher supported the Idea of
three Elements Earth water and Heat - few
[underline]are worth quoting[/underline]
The most remarkable of them perhaps is
his speculations concerning the Nature of the
heavenly bodies all of which He recorded
as composed of Materials similar to those
of the Earth and he endeavoured to prove

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00057|dnp16a55pp|94831649[/page]
his operation by stating that at different
times stones had fallen from the heavens
[underline]This last idea[/underline] is attributed to him by Aristotle
by Pliny and by Plutarch. [underline]Aristotle [/underline] ridicules
the notion for in those days as well as
in the present times there were sceptics
concerning the bodies beleived to have fallen
from above -
But Plutarch positively asserts on the
authority of Damachus that in the second
year of the 78 olympiad a large body of
fire which emitted many flashes like shooting
stars was seen to fall near the river Egos
in Thrace and that it left in its place
a large and dark [underline]coloured stone[/underline] and that
such [deletion]one[/deletion] an event and that other events

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00058|dnp16a56pp|94831650[/page]
of the same kind would happen was
[underline]foretold[/underline] by Anaxagorus -
The few facts that we are in possession
of with regard to the first school of
Philosophy in Greece proves that as far
as their [underline]means extended[/underline] accurate observation
was a guide to their researches; but
their views were necessarily limited
They were unassisted by experiment
and instead of being rewarded for their
most enlightened opinions they were
constantly in danger of persecution
The people of that period were
wholly unprepared to receive the truths

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11601-000-00059|dnp16a57pp|94831651[/page]
of natural philosophy [underline]which opposed [/underline]
received superstitions -
And in consequence as will be shewn
in the next lecture the infant game
of the science of observation soon faded
and perished and then as if dazzled
by the light afforded them by Nature
soon closed their Eyes and found it more
expedient more profitable and more
conformable to the taste of the Age to
amuse themselves with the visions of
their own Creation -
