concerning the origin of things were similar
to those of Ocellus and Parmenides -
He was a firm believer in the [underline]transmigration[/underline]
[underline]of souls[/underline]; and in two very ridiculous lines
positively declares that he recollected many
of the former states of existance which he
had passed through and amongst them
he mentions those of a plant Bird and
a fish - He believed that he had lived
in the earth the air and the water;
and to experience the effect of a new
element [underline]fire[/underline] it is reported that he
threw himself into the Crater of
Mount Etna -
