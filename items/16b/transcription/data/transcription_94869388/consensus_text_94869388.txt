Formed by the potent solar ray
On the blue bosom of the sea
We while the morning light is pale
[underline]Glide along[/underline] the watered vale
Or in the [underline]miday splendour[/underline] rest
Upon the mountains frozen breast
From us the Children of the main
descend the snow the mist the rain
And [underline]our sweet [/underline]influence shed in dew
Gives to the Earth its verdant hue
And nu[insertion]r[/insertion]tures in the summers showers
Each tender plant each fragrent flower
The representation of the Comedy in the
theatre of Athens appears to have been the
first circumstance which led to the
unpopularity [deletion]of[/deletion] and persecution of [underline]Socrates[/underline]
