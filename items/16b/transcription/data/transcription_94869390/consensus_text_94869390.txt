And in his opinion Concerning the Universe
He adopted the ideas of the pythagoreans.-
[underline]Timeus[/underline] seems to have been his great Authority
and in his dialogue called by the name
of that philosopher. He professes to deliver
[underline]his opinions[/underline]; but He has thrown new
clouds of abstracted metaphysics over doctrines
originally obscure: and in examining the work
the mind is continually perplexed with
fancies of numbers passing into [underline]quantities[/underline]
ideas becoming matter; and the dreams of
the                 forming the universe after the
model of his own intellectual world: and
fashionng the mind of man after the
image of the the Material World.-
