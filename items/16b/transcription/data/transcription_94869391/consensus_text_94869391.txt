The eloquence of Plato even in his
abstracted systems of the universe is of
a high character it may delude and
seduce; but when the beauty of language
is taken away the charm vanishes -
He promises a reality, He presents a dream.
His theories are like brilliant clouds of the
evening may delight and affect the
imagination; but they present nothing
permanent, they cannot be touched they
cannot be retained and they vanish
without leaving in the mind a trace
of their existance
