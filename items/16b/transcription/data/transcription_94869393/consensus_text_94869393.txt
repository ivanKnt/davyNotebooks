This is the most remarkable part of his
doctrine and the only one in which He
appears to have anticipated the Moderns
Aristotle considered matter as susceptible of
any form and hence he supposed that different
bodies were convertible into each other by the
superinduction of new qualities.-
It is on this doctrine of the Philosopher
that the reasonings of the school men concerning
actual and potential existence are founded
Aristotle in advancing it laid the foundation
of those endless quibbles and sophisms which
so much perplexed the minds of men in the
middle ages
