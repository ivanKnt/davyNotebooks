consideres pyrites amber and different species
[deletion]and def[/deletion] of [underline]mineral Coals[/underline] and He speaks
of those last substances as being in use -

however and burn like wood coals -
They are found in Liguria where there is
likewise Amber: And in Elis and in the way
to Olympia in the mountains: and they
are employed by the smiths -
