The Geological Theories of [unclear]Theophrastus[/unclear]
are often very ingenious and always very
candid; he makes an observation which it
is to be wished were more attended to in
modern times "That the same effects may be
produced in Nature by very different causes"
He considered primitive Earths of various
Kinds as the bases of stones and He supposed
chrystals to be formed by solutions of those
earths and a consequent precipitation
He believed in a peculiar force or attractive
power by which the parts cohered together
and He considered the mode of their union
