Cicero who revived the poem of Lucretius
after his death studied with great zeal the
different systems of Philosophy discussed in it.
And in his work on the [underline]nature of the Gods[/underline]
He has examined most of the ancient Theories
of Cosmogony: but without adding any new
opinion of his own -
He seemed aware of the impractibility
of arriving at truth on a subject in
which no accurate data [underline]were known[/underline] and
his philosophical disquisitions appear
rather to have been intended as amusements
of fancy, than as serious exercises of
Reason -
