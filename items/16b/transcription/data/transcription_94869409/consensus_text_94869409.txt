The descriptive part of his book on stones
is partly borrowed from Theophrastus -
but he has added to the simple and philosophical
details of the Greek Author an infinite variety
of unimportant anecdotes of vague incidents and
a number of ridiculous accounts of the
medical virtues of the substances [underline]treated[/underline] of
Thus in describing the [underline]dimond[/underline] after
noticing the form of its chrystals and its extreme
hardness he details an absurd opinion of its
being easily broken by a blow after having
been infused for some time in goats blood
He states there is a great enmity between
the dimond [underline]and the lodestone[/underline]
