disengaged in the interior caverns of the Globe
And inundations as depending in many
cases upon the sudden elevation of land in
[underline]the sea[/underline] -
Pliny flourished in the time of Vespasian
and Titus He lived honoured by those Emperors
and respected by the public:-
He is one of the few Philosophers who
enjoyed riches and reputation in his life time
and his death may be said to have been
glorious and worthy of his Character
He was commander of the Roman fleet at
Mainum. |_In the 79 year of the Christian Era
An eruption of vesuvius took place the first
and perhaps the greatest.
