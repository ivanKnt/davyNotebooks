It had been observed in the earliest exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on
the Voltaic pile that Soda was protruded
from the cloths where they were in contact
with the silver; All the experiments
likewise shewed that - saline matters
were decomposed in the circuit; & that
inflammable matters in general were determined
towards the negative surface;- Thus I found
that Sulphur, [deletion]from[/deletion]& the metals even those supposed
incapable of being revived by nascent Hydrogene
followed the same law - & [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion]Mess Bergelius
& Pontin [deletion]&[/deletion]. shewed that saline solutions
in general; were decomposed according to the
same circumstances as muriate of Soda.
in a series of extensive exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] made to
investigate the laws of these changes,
I found that all compounds whether
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] soluble or insoluble, whether
[deletion]saline or stoney[/deletion]. afforded their acid
Matter at the positive surface &
their alkaline Matter at the negative surface.
