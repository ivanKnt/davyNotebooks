         <p>A pupil of Plato's whose philosophical idealism he came to reject, arguing instead
            for the primacy of observations of natural phenomena. He thus established the divide
            between theory and experiment in science that can still be detected today. Aristotle's
            writings became the main way the natural world was understood from the Middle Ages
            to the seventeenth century, especially in the universities.</p>

         <p>A pupil of Socrates, much of Plato's large corpus of surviving philosophical texts
            are written in the form of Socratic dialogues. He espoused a philosophical idealism
            including the primacy of mathematics and an anti-democratic political philosophy because
            of the execution of Socrates. Plato's writings have been, and are, so influential
            that all subsequent philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato.</p>
