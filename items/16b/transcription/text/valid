[underline]Geology Lecture 2[superscript]d[/superscript][/underline]
The number of Grecian philosophers and
the variety of opinions attributed to them
[underline]even in the[/underline] first ages of civilization
of the people demonstrated in striking
manner the bias of public opinion towards
study and the zeal with which science
and information were sought for and
pursued.
The teachers of those times however in
attempting universal systems formed a
whole of which all the parts were
necessarily imperfect.

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00004|dnp16b02pp|94869359[/page]
And the disciples either following [deletion]implici[insertion]tly[/insertion][/deletion]
implicitly or altering only in a small
degree the dogmas of their masters, were
constantly diffusing Theories in which [underline]truths[/underline]
[underline]and errors speculations and facts[/underline] were
indiscriminately blended -
This was equally the case in all
their departments of human enquiry
if the records of the early doctrines brough
brought down to the present times be
supposed authentic -
Filled with the sacred strength of
genius the first sages seemed uniformly
to have beleived that the human mind
was capable of embracing all objects of knowledge

[page]5|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00005|dnp16b03pp|94869360[/page]
They delivered their opinions with the
same confidence upon Nature and Man
upon the divine and upon the human
intelligence
And they seemed to suppose that the
paths of practical and as well as of
abstracted sciences were to be developed
by the mere powers of the unassisted
understanding -
But though all prone to hasty speculation
in forming connections yet many admitted
of appeal to experience and observation
And it is to this circumstance and to
this alone that we are whatever is

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00006|dnp16b04pp|94869361[/page]
found true or valuable in their reasonings
on [underline]sensible[/underline] objects on Nature and on
the Earth.
That the school of Thales had paid
some attention to natural phaenomena
is evident from the accounts given
in the last lecture.
And one of the fundamental axioms of
the followers of [underline]Pythagoras[/underline] was that
the external [deletion]sign[/deletion] signs of things
were no less necessary to the discovery of
truth than reason and [underline]analogy[/underline] -
The general doctrines of the
Pythagoreans concerning the appearances
of nature had much more influence

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00007|dnp16b05pp|94869362[/page]
on the early progress of science than
any other system and the greatest
instruct[deletion]ion[/deletion][insertion]ors[/insertion] amongst the ancients and
men whose opinions have come down
to the present time most unimpared
and with the greatest glory belonged
to this celebrated sect of Philosophers -
The History of their Illustrious founder
is observed to so great an extent with fable
and the marvellous that it is very difficult
indeed to trace any of the real occurances
of his life even his native place is unknown
seven cities only contended for the honour
of having given birth to [underline]Homer[/underline]; but as
appears from the testimonies of Laertius

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00008|dnp16b06pp|94869363[/page]
Lycus and Josepheus no less than nine
different Nations considered Pythagoras as
their Countryman.
He was however generally supposed to be of
Samos and his school is universally allowed to
have been established about 500 years before
Christ at Crotona.
Like other ancient Philosophers He travelled
in quest of information and it is said that he
derived a considerable part of his knowledge
from the priests of Egypt, He at least
learnt from them the Art of professing
one doctrine to the public and of teaching
another to his friends a refinement which

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00009|dnp16b07pp|94869364[/page]
though it satisfied the people for many years
did not in the end preserve him from [underline]persecution[/underline]
- Pythagoras if one may believe Plutarch thought
much; talked little and wrote nothing.
Laertius mentioned however the titles of some
books supposed to be written by him: but
upon very loose authorities;
Iamblichus and porphyry attribute to him
wonderful power over Nature and the faculty
of predicting future events;-
Their details however are not to be found
in any of the more [underline]ancient writers[/underline] and
appear to be forgeries, and the greatest
wonder faithfully recorded of him is that

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00010|dnp16b08pp|94869365[/page]
he was able to keep his disciples silent
for five years of probation.-
The doctrines of [underline]Pythagoras[/underline] concerning
Nature as recorded by his followers mark in
the strongest manner boldness of conception
extent of knowledge possessing a mind filled
with some of the most important truths of
mathematical Science,
He endeavoured to apply the principles
of number and quantity to the explanation
of the physical forms of Bodies and the laws
of their changes - He considered matter as
composed of certain different primary
elements.

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00011|dnp16b09pp|94869366[/page]
He made their number five and assigned to
each the form of a regular solid.-
The elementary matter of [underline]Earth[/underline] He regarded
as consisting of [underline]cubes[/underline] -
The principles of water He imagined to
have twenty [underline]sides[/underline] -
Air He regarded as consisting of eight sided
figures
Ether of twelve sided figures
[underline]And fire of pyramids -[/underline]
Having discovered the monochord He was
so much delighted with [underline]the invention[/underline] as to
search in every department of science for
analogies to [underline]Harmony[/underline] and hence He conceived
the elements of bodies were united in [underline]proportion[/underline]

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00012|dnp16b10pp|94869367[/page]
which may be expressed by the relations
of numbers upon the musical scale; and
that all the infinite varieties of matter
were deducible from different orderly mixtures
and [underline]combinations[/underline] of the five Geometrical
elements.
This Theory of the composition of the [underline]Globe[/underline]
[underline]though[/underline] founded aupon assumptions which
later experience has demonstrated to be
visionary is nevertheless [deletion]is[/deletion] exceedingly
ingenious and very remarkable on account
of the strong analogy that it bears to
the system of [underline]the moderns[/underline] concerning
Chrystalizations.

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00013|dnp16b11pp|94869368[/page]
Rome de Lisle and the Abbe H in their
late refined speculations upon the forms
of minerals having supposed six primitive
or Geometrical [underline]elements[/underline] capable like
those of the Philosopher of Crotona of
being united in various arrangements and
and of being again resolved into their
original forms -
The few features that are develloped to us
of the understanding of pythagoras in an age
of darkness and of ignorance are at least
sufficient to explain his great influence
upon Philosophy
[deletion]His discoveries even as imperfectly[/deletion]
[deletion]displayed are of a high stamp[/deletion]

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00014|dnp16b12pp|94869369[/page]
His discoveries even as imperfectly displayed
are of a high stamp and it is not
the least admirable trait of his character
that he supported the idea of the roundness
of the earth and its revolution round the
[underline]Sun [/underline] -
The first Pythagorean philosopher whose
works are still in existance is [underline]Ocellus[/underline]
the Lucanian who is supposed to have
flourished about 500 years before Christ
in the beginning of the [deletion]of the[/deletion]
celebrated era of the triumphs of
[underline]Grecian Liberty[/underline]
in the beginning of the [deletion]of the[/deletion]

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00015|dnp16b13pp|94869370[/page]
His treatise [underline]upon the universe[/underline]; there is no
reason to doubt its authenticity; and it is
in the highest degree interesting as being
the earliest Book composed upon a subject of
pure [underline]science [/underline] -
[underline]Ocellus [/underline] like his master considered the
Earth as composed of different regular parts,
which imperceptible by our senses, are in a
continued state of motion and of change -
In this system[deletion]s[/deletion] the solar fire is made the
great agent in producing new arrangements
of the bodies belonging to the Globe -
This substance He regarded as the bond of
union between all the other elements;
which unite earth water Air and other
in the highest degree interesting as being

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00016|dnp16b14pp|94869371[/page]
From the successive union and seperation
of the elements He explains the order
of Nature; [underline]in which[/underline] though the parts are
in continual change the whole remain
one and unalterable.
Heraclitus of Ephesus and Parmenides of 
[unclear]Elii[/unclear] who flourished about the time of Ocellus
possessed a similar doctrine. Heraclitus not
contented with supposing that Heat was the
great active principle held that it was
convertible into all forms of matter that
the pyramid by its modification produced
the other four regular forms of [underline]pythagoras[/underline]
great active principle held that it was

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00017|dnp16b15pp|94869372[/page]
The high importance assigned in the ancient
systems to [underline]fire[/underline] is not indeed to be wondered at
when the general appearances of Nature are
considered.
The Sun the source of the vivifying warmth
belonging to our Globe is likewise the cause
of the most numerous and most delightful of
our sensations those of vision; by means of it
water is raised from the ocean and diffused
[underline]through the Air[/underline]; by means of it vegetation
is produced and the whole of the surface
of the Earth cloathed with verdure and
ornamented with Beauty -
water is raised from the ocean and diffused
[underline]through The Air;[/underline] by means of it vegetation
when the general appearances of Nature are

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00018|dnp16b16pp|94869373[/page]
The contrast of winter with spring of Night
with day of the ice clad mountains and
steril snow plains of the North with
the warm and fertil [deletion]hills[/deletion] [insertion]vallies[/insertion] of the south
must have effected in the strongest degree
the minds of those whose imaginations [deletion]were[/deletion]
are constantly alive and the reasons and
impressions similar to these which have
impelled so many uncultivated Nations
to offer divine honours to the principle
of fire and to exalt it into a God seemed
to have operated upon the early Philosophers
in inducing them to consider it as the most
active and energetic of the Elements and
are constantly alive and the reasons and
the warm and fertile [deletion]xxxxx[/deletion] vallies of the south

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00019|dnp16b17pp|94869374[/page]
as the material agent the most connected
with the changes of things with motion
organization and Life -
A first intelligent cause of the order of the
universe was admited by Pythagoras and
his Early followers but many of them and
particularly Ocellus considered matter as having
constantly existed in form similar to its
present arrangement.
And [deletion]Timaus[/deletion] Timaus the Locrian was
the first Philosopher of the sect who supported
the sublime and sacred doctrine of a
primary Creator -
One of his treatises is at present in existance
It is entitled the soul of the universe

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00020|dnp16b18pp|94869375[/page]
And though obscured with mysticism and
in many parts unintelligible it nevertheless
contains some sublime and striking passages.
Timeus considered all ideas of the forms of
things as prexisting in the supreme mind.
and matter as modelled after those ideas in
order and arrangement in consequence of the
divine will - Earth he supposed to have
been first produced then water then Air
and last of All fire -
And from their mixture in the Harmonious
proportions of numbers he conceived that
the universe was created in visible and

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00021|dnp16b19pp|94869376[/page]
tangible form perfect in its essence and
indestructible as [deletion]in[/deletion] a whole the temple of
the Creator having all its parts adapted
to the great ends of life; and everywhere
filled with animation with sentiment and
with [deletion]life[/deletion] Happiness: -
Timeus is said to have taught Philosophy
in the middle of the fifth century before
the [underline]christian Era[/underline] and he was contemporary with
Empedocles the Sicilian who was likewise
a [underline]zealous pythagorean[/underline]. some fragments
of a poem of Empedocles on Nature are
preserved in Diogines Laertius: from which
it may be discovered that His opinions

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00022|dnp16b20pp|94869377[/page]
concerning the origin of things were similar
to those of Ocellus and Parmenides -
He was a firm believer in the [underline]transmigration[/underline]
[underline]of souls[/underline]; and in two very ridiculous lines
positively declares that he recollected many
of the former states of existance which he
had passed through and amongst them
he mentions those of a plant Bird and
a fish - He believed that he had lived
in the earth the air and the water;
and to experience the effect of a new
element [underline]fire[/underline] it is reported that he
threw himself into the Crater of
Mount Etna -

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00023|dnp16b21pp|94869378[/page]
The Age of the greatest political activity
of the Grecian states was likewise the age
in which philosophy was examined and
extended with the greatest ardour,
And an emulation similar to that which
animated the celebrated [underline]Generals and [deletion]warrio[/deletion][/underline]
[underline]warriors[/underline] of the time influenced the sages
and induced them to exert the full powers
of their mind.-
The pythagorean system though it
possessed a great number of admirers was
not without very powerful opponents and
Zeno of Elea and [deletion]Leucip[/deletion] Leucippus said 
to be of Abdera attacked the fundamental
principles with great zeal -

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00024|dnp16b22pp|94869379[/page]
The physical opinions of Leucippus
[underline]only[/underline] are preserved and they are said to
have been similar to those of his master Zeno
Leucippus according to Diogines Laertius
conceived all things as formed of minute
parts or atoms infinitely various in
their figures and without regularity but
constantly in motion; and endowed with a
power of gravity or attraction inducing
them assume the forms of Material bodies.
From the attractive powers and their
primary motions He supposed the changes
of things to arise:

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00025|dnp16b23pp|94869380[/page]
And on these foundations with the assistance
of the word [underline]necessity or chance[/underline] He established
his general system of which almost all
[underline]the particulars[/underline] are equally absurd with
the [underline]primary principles[/underline]
For he held that the stars were a [deletion]colection[/deletion]
collection of atoms kindled by their motion
[underline]in a vacuum[/underline] and that they are nearer
to us than [underline]the Sun[/underline] which he supposed
to revolve round the [underline]moon[/underline].
He considered the Earth as flat and
the sea as constantly diminishing and
He vainly predicted that at some time
the whole surface would be dry land -

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00026|dnp16b24pp|94869381[/page]
The only immediate follower of any
reputation was likewise of Abdera He
lived about 400 years before Christ and
was reputed to be an observer and an
experimenter -
The general doctrines of this school
very little currency -
The common sense of Men revolted at
such opinions as those which supposed
Harmony capable of arriving without any
cause from confusion and intellegence
as the result of a fortuitous mixture
of senseless particles of matter -

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00027|dnp16b25pp|94869382[/page]
Even in minds uninformed by true [underline]religion[/underline]
the feeling of design and of a Great
and useful order in nature is seldom
[deletion]is[/deletion] absent and however clouded by superstition
it is still cherished: and the light though
dim and feeble is preferred to perfect
darkness.
To enter upon a description of the
minute differences between the disciples
of the various schools would be an
unpleasant as well as [underline]an[/underline] [deletion]us[insertion]e[/insertion]less[/deletion] [underline]useless[/underline]
labour -
From the time of Anagorus: Words
had been multiplying; though few new

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00028|dnp16b26pp|94869383[/page]
[underline]observations[/underline] had been made.
And whilst theories of Cosmogony were
almost infinitely varied no accurate
knowledge concerning the materials
of the Globe had been obtained -
Almost every studient that He could
explain what the Globe was in remote
antiquity and what it would be in
future ages: but no one examined
its present state and the nature of
its different parts -
Every disciple of the pythagorean
School confidently believed that He knew

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00029|dnp16b27pp|94869384[/page]
what matter composed the Sun moon stars
and the vault of heaven; whilst He was
perfectly ignorant of the nature of the
soils and the stones beneath his feet.
It appeared to all the Philosophers more
easy to imagine than to observe and
more amusing to dream than to reason -
Socrates the great Socrates seems to have
been the first person who had the good
sense and the boldness to divide the
systems of his Age.
His profession that [underline]in wisdom He felt[/underline]
this only [underline]that He knew Nothing[/underline] forms
a striking contrast to the arrogant assertions

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00030|dnp16b28pp|94869385[/page]
of some of his contemporaries - 
No theory of Socrates concerning
Nature is delivered down to us
and there is every reason to believe
that this most [underline]excellent man[/underline] saw
all the imperfections of the methods
of the [underline]Ancients[/underline] and the vanity of
[underline]their researches[/underline]
That he was devoted to experimental
is evident from many testimonies
one of the great accusations against
him in his most unjust trial as
quoted by plato in his apology was

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00031|dnp16b29pp|94869386[/page]
[underline]That he examined with unholy curiosity[/underline]
[underline]into things beneath the Earth and in the skies[/underline]
And it is very remarkable that the ridicule
directed against him in the Comedy of
Aristophanes [underline]"the Cloud"[/underline] is chiefly connected
with his researches into the causes of natural
things:
And this production affords us almost [deletion]all[/deletion]
the only remains of his opinions on
Natural philosophy -
He is represented in Aristophanes as attributing
thunder and lightening to material influences
existing in the clouds and not to the
immediate anger of jupiter -

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00032|dnp16b30pp|94869387[/page]
As supposing that they are the causes
of rain of [underline]mist and snow[/underline] [underline]and that[/underline]
[underline]the earth[/underline] owes its fertility to water
concealed in the Air -
- The comic part in consequence chuses
to consider the clouds as the deities of Socrates
and he seems to have given a general
Idea of the Philosophers opinion concerning
them in one of the Choruses in which
they are personified.
I shall read an imitation which
I hope will at least express the principle
sense if not the beauty of the original

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00033|dnp16b31pp|94869388[/page]
Formed by the potent solar ray
On the blue bosom of the sea
We while the morning light is pale
[underline]Glide along[/underline] the watered vale
Or in the [underline]miday splendour[/underline] rest
Upon the mountains frozen breast
From us the Children of the main
descend the snow the mist the rain
And [underline]our sweet [/underline]influence shed in dew
Gives to the Earth its verdant hue
And nu[insertion]r[/insertion]tures in the summers showers
Each tender plant each fragrent flower
The representation of the Comedy in the
theatre of Athens appears to have been the
first circumstance which led to the
unpopularity [deletion]of[/deletion] and persecution of [underline]Socrates[/underline]

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00034|dnp16b32pp|94869389[/page]
He was present when it was first perfomed
and he is said to have stood during the
whole time that the public might see
the object of ridicule of the play -
And his answer when He was asked why
He thus exposed  himself equally exhibits
the dignity of his mind and the mildness
of his character
[underline]I consider my self (says[/underline] the philosopher)
only [underline]as the host of[/underline] a great feast and
I am happy to be able to [deletion]entertain[/deletion] provide
entertainment for [underline]so many people[/underline] -
Plato appears to have attended to the
observations of Nature less than any of his
contempories;
and he is said to have

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00035|dnp16b33pp|94869390[/page]
And in his opinion Concerning the Universe
He adopted the ideas of the pythagoreans.-
[underline]Timeus[/underline] seems to have been his great Authority
and in his dialogue called by the name
of that philosopher. He professes to deliver
[underline]his opinions[/underline]; but He has thrown new
clouds of abstracted metaphysics over doctrines
originally obscure: and in examining the work
the mind is continually perplexed with
fancies of numbers passing into [underline]quantities[/underline]
ideas becoming matter; and the dreams of
the                 forming the universe after the
model of his own intellectual world: and
fashionng the mind of man after the
image of the the Material World.-

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00036|dnp16b34pp|94869391[/page]
The eloquence of Plato even in his
abstracted systems of the universe is of
a high character it may delude and
seduce; but when the beauty of language
is taken away the charm vanishes -
He promises a reality, He presents a dream.
His theories are like brilliant clouds of the
evening may delight and affect the
imagination; but they present nothing
permanent, they cannot be touched they
cannot be retained and they vanish
without leaving in the mind a trace
of their existance 
trace

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00037|dnp16b35pp|94869392[/page]
|_Aristotle though the disciple of Plato
has paid very little attention to his
opinions concerning Nature gifted with
a cooler imagination and a more
comprehensive and more patient understanding
He condescended to reason on things and
to endeavour to explain Causes from their
effects -
The philosopher of Stagyra considered
the universe as composed [underline]by form[/underline] added
to [underline]matter[/underline] and as capable of being resolved
into air Earth [deletion]and[/deletion] water and fire -
He made the distinction between simple
and compound bodies and supported two principles
of motion [underline]gravity[/underline] and a repulsive force
to

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00038|dnp16b36pp|94869393[/page]
This is the most remarkable part of his
doctrine and the only one in which He
appears to have anticipated the Moderns
Aristotle considered matter as susceptible of
any form and hence he supposed that different
bodies were convertible into each other by the
superinduction of new qualities.-
It is on this doctrine of the Philosopher
that the reasonings of the school men concerning
actual and potential existence are founded
Aristotle in advancing it laid the foundation
of those endless quibbles and sophisms which
so much perplexed the minds of men in the
middle ages

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00039|dnp16b37pp|94869394[/page]
And it is on his logic that Thomas Aequinas
had founded some of his ridiculous questions
such as whether a potentially existing Gold
is more valuable than actually existing lead
and whether a possibly existing Angel is
better than an actually existing fly.-
It is said by Pliny that Alexander the
Great employed large sums of money and
a number of Men in procuring subjects in
Natural History for Aristotle; but amongst these 
subjects none of the fossil productions of the
earth are mentioned; and Aristotle in his
view of the Globe seems to have confined
[underline]himself wholly[/underline] either to abstracted speculation

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00040|dnp16b38pp|94869395[/page]
Concerning the [underline]elements[/underline] or to descriptions
of the forms and properties of animated being
-Theophrastus the successor of Aristotle in
the [underline]Athenian school[/underline] is the first [deletion]who[/deletion] of the
Ancients who has any claim to the title of
[underline]Geologist[/underline] or [underline]Mineralogist[/underline].
Theophrastus was a native Lesbos but He left
his country at a very early period: and
became a disciple of Plato -
And [underline]he was[/underline] no less celebrated for his
industry learning and eloquence than for his
generosity and public spirit.
This philosopher was the Author of a great
many important treatises. He wrote on the

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00041|dnp16b39pp|94869396[/page]
Earth the the metals and on stones, the last
only of those three works has come down
to modern times Its value is great and
singular and it is impossible not to regret
the loss of the other disquisitions upon
analogous subjects.-
In the work on [underline]Fossils[/underline] Theophrastus
describes with considerable perspicacity a
great number of the Stones [underline]and gems[/underline]
known [underline]to modern mineralogist[/underline]: and his
classification is often very correct
Thus He divides fossils into three
incombustibles, the infusible the combustible
and the fusible.-

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00042|dnp16b40pp|94869397[/page]
Under the head of incombustible and infusible
fossils he describes the Gems and rock Chrystals
In treating of combustible fossiles He
consideres pyrites amber and different species
[deletion]and def[/deletion] of [underline]mineral Coals[/underline] and He speaks
of those last substances as being in use -
Thus in the 28 section of this work He
says, [underline]Those fossile[/underline] substances called coals that
are broken for use are [underline]earthy[/underline]. They kindle
however and burn like wood coals -
They are found in Liguria where there is
likewise Amber: And in Elis and in the way
to Olympia in the mountains: and they
are employed by the smiths -

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00043|dnp16b41pp|94869398[/page]
He noticed several fossil stones and amongst
them different species of pumice: which He
considers as formed by volcanic fires - He was
well acquainted with a variety [underline]of earths[/underline] with
different species of marble and with the ores
of Quicksliver [deletion]and[/deletion] of lime and of Magnesia
And He mentions a fossil found in the
mines of  - which inflamed when oil
was poured upon it a property which has
been discovered in no other fossil except in
the black wood of Derbyshire so that there

The Geological Theories of [unclear]Theophrastus[/unclear]
are often very ingenious and always very
candid; he makes an observation which it
is to be wished were more attended to in
modern times "That the same effects may be
produced in Nature by very different causes"
He considered primitive Earths of various
Kinds as the bases of stones and He supposed
chrystals to be formed by solutions of those
earths and a consequent precipitation
He believed in a peculiar force or attractive
power by which the parts cohered together
and He considered the mode of their union

No less than the [underline]peculiarity[/underline] of the matter
of which they are formed [underline]as essential[/underline] to
the differences of the properties of the resulting
compounds.
Theophrastus evidently possessed Genius
talent and the faculty of minute
observation: His influence as a teacher
was great; He is said to have had at one time
more than two thousand scholars and yet -
not a single disciple was found to follow
the steps of the illustrious master [underline]in the[/underline]
[underline]study[/underline] of Nature to trust like Him to facts
and to [underline]record only the results[/underline] of [underline]experience[/underline]
[underline]and accurate examination[/underline].-

opinion of his own -
He seemed aware of the impractibility

his philosophical disquisitions appear
rather to have been intended as amusements

But yet even in this happy period, Rome
could not boast of one man devoted to science:
And the philosophy of the Age is develloped
only in the writings of the poets
Virgil as  would appear from several passages
in his works was a Pythagorean - Horace seemed
to have favoured the Epicurean doctrine and

This Illustrious person possessed the highest
degree of industry and an ardour in the
pursuit of knowledge which no difficulties could
repress He considered all the productions of
the Earth as worthy attention; either for their
order their beauty their uses or relations to
Man -
Possessed of such requisites for discovery He was
still deficient in the great characteristics of
a strong mind and a philosophical spirit
Endowed with a simple heart and apparently
incapable of deceiving He believed almost [unclear]whatever[/unclear]

He was nevertheless a minute observer and a
faithful historian but neither an experimental
philosopher nor a man of [underline]Genius[/underline] -
A small part only of the extensive [underline]Natural[/underline]
History of Pliny is devoted to [underline]Geological[/underline]
[underline]considerations[/underline] and to the fossil Production of the Earth

The descriptive part of his book on stones
is partly borrowed from Theophrastus -
but he has added to the simple and philosophical
details of the Greek Author an infinite variety
of unimportant anecdotes of vague incidents and
a number of ridiculous accounts of the
medical virtues of the substances [underline]treated[/underline] of
Thus in describing the [underline]dimond[/underline] after
noticing the form of its chrystals and its extreme
hardness he details an absurd opinion of its
being easily broken by a blow after having
been infused for some time in goats blood
He states there is a great enmity between
the dimond [underline]and the lodestone[/underline]

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00055|dnp16b53pp|94869410[/page]
And that [underline]this gem[/underline] is a remedy for madness
and an antidote against poison.
And he advises all ladies who have it in their
power to wear dimonds as they are a certain
preventative against melancholy and lowness of
spirits -
Pliny gives a minute account of the
oriental gems and states that they are so hard
as not to be scratched by Agate and much
heavier than chrystal He appears a firm
believer in their medical uses; though
He sometimes seems to doubt whether or no
they can be applied to the purposes of
enchantment.
There is a strong analogy between
[unclear]plinias[/unclear] History of the precious stones and
that given in the Greek poem on Gems

ascribed [underline]to orpheus[/underline] which however is
generally believed to have been written
about the age of [underline]Constantius[/underline] -
The Greek poet like the roman philosopher
supposes the greater number of maladies to
be owing to a softness and deficiency of
strength in the organic matter of the body
and therefore concludes that the hardest [underline]substances[/underline]
[underline]in nature[/underline] are those most calculated to restore it
to [underline]health and strength[/underline].-
of the metals Pliny has described Gold, Silver,
Copper, lead, Tin, Iron Quicksilver and antimony
And He was acquainted with the ores of Zinc Bismuth
and Manganese -

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11602-000-00057|dnp16b55pp|94869412[/page]
He has given however no distinct description of
the working of the metals and he seems to have
been wholly unacquainted with the position of
metallic veins and the strata in which they are found
The most accurate though perhaps the least
entertaining part of his book is that in which
[underline]He describes[/underline] the great changes of the Globe;
He was perfectly acquainted with the origin
of Rivers and one of his most beautiful and finished
[underline]descriptions[/underline] is that of the agency of water which
I have translated from the 30 book

For this one principle as it were rules
and commands all the other elements -
It acts upon and dissolves the solid earth -
It weakens and even extinguishes the devouring
energy of fire. It rises into the air in [underline]vapor[/underline]
and forms clouds and mists whence lightning
and thunder whence hail and snow and
rain and the fertilizing dew
Pliny attributes the tides to their
real cause the effects of the sun and moon
Earthquakes He considers as owing to elastic fluids

And inundations as depending in many
cases upon the sudden elevation of land in

Pliny flourished in the time of Vespasian
and Titus He lived honoured by those Emperors
and respected by the public:-
He is one of the few Philosophers who
enjoyed riches and reputation in his life time
and his death may be said to have been
glorious and worthy of his Character
He was commander of the Roman fleet at
Mainum. |_In the 79 year of the Christian Era
An eruption of vesuvius took place the first
and perhaps the greatest.

Animated with the desire of [underline]examining[/underline]
this wonderful phenomena, He landed from
a small vessel on the coast and whilst
engaged in making his observations was
surprised by the streams of ignited matter
flowing rapidly from the mountain
He tried to escape; but all retreat was
impossible and He fell suffocated in
an instant by the sulphurous vapour
emitted from[underline]the lava[/underline] -
With this account of Pliny I shall
conclude the present lecture in which
I have endeavoured to collect from a
variety of sources the little knowledge that

its Elements and its changes
To bring forth truth from the darkness
of antiquity is a much more delightful
task than to detail [underline]errors[/underline]and [underline]absurdities[/underline]
but the [underline]knowledge[/underline] of the present day
will perhaps appear with greater brightness
and [deletion]understanding[/deletion] and destinctness in being
contrasted with the [underline]ignorance[/underline] of Elder periods
In literature in the fine arts in works
of taste and in all combinations that
required only the native process of genius
the ancients perhaps are still our masters
but in Philosophy [unclear]thas[/unclear] systems and their
doctrines relating to nature when compared
