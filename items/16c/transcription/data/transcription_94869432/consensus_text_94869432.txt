absurdities of their doctrines, He had seen
admirable changes produced in bodies and
He knew not the limits of the operation of Nature
By Him the [underline]production[/underline] of Gold and the
transmutation of [underline]Metals[/underline] were considered only
as [underline]objects[/underline] worthy of investigation; but
He never affirmed confidently concerning them.
He had made many important discoveries
and particularly that of one expensive compound
similar to Gunpowder -
And yet he seldom suffered his imagination
to cloud his reason and He was no
enthusiast with regard to the merit of
his inventions.-
