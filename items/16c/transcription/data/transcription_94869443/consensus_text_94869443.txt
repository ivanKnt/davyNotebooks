He was the first person who supposed that
elastic fluid existed different from the
Air of the Atmosphere and [underline]from him[/underline]
we derive the modern [underline]chemical[/underline] name [underline]of Gas[/underline]
He likewise invented another denomination
[underline]Blas[/underline] which is not quite so intelligible -
He considered it as of a much finer
nature than Air; and as being derived
by the Earth and from the sun and stars -
Van Helmont made some very laborious
experiments to prove that water was
capable of being converted into [underline]Earth[/underline]
and He [underline]revived [/underline]the the doctrine of
Thales that it was the general productive
principle.-
