establishing [underline]the Sciences[/underline] upon their
true and immutable foundations.-
Many scientific persons [underline]before Bacon[/underline]
had pursued the method of Experiment
in all its precision, many had dared
to despise the logic and forms of the
ancients, but He was the [underline]first[/underline]
[underline]philosopher[/underline] who laid down plans for
extending knowledge of universal application
who ventured to assert that all the sciences
could be nothing more than expressions
of facts and that the first step towards
the attainment of real discovery was
the humiliating confession of [underline]ignorance[/underline]
