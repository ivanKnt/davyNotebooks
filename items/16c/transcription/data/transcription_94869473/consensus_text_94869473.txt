As a poetical Romance it is highly
interesting and entertaining but as
a philosophical opinion it is wholly
unworthy of [deletion]opinion[/deletion] attention and it
affords one proof amongst many others

which express general truths so as
to make them serve as supports for
hypotheses of human invention so as
to blend them with the visions
and fancies of men - _|
