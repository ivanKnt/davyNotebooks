With regard to the idea that our present
land was formed in the bosom of the
sea by the mere action of water is
is one that may be controverted and
overturned with ease.-
The greatest portion of our high rocks
and elevated mountains are chrystalized
masses containing no organic remains
and not arranged in layers and they
consist of matter wholly incapable of
being consolidated by water such is
granite which forms a considerable
part of the alps which constitutes
the great mountains of Scotland and
the hills and cliffs of Cornwall.-
