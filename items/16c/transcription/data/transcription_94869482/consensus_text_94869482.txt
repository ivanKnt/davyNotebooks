And stratified rocks even which seem
themselves to have been deposited by
water are often blended with rocks of
another description so as rather to indicate
a great inundation and rapid transit
of the ocean over [underline]the land[/underline] than a
gradual and [underline]quite deposition[/underline] of the
solid matter of the earth in the bed of the sea.
It is impossible to doubt that in the
lapse of ages some slight [unclear]dimunition [/unclear]
of our mountains must take place from
the [underline]agency of rivers[/underline] but there are many
causes in Nature which appears
to counteract the effect.
