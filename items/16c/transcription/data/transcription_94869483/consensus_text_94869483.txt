Centuries nearly have passed away and
no material change in the form of the
solid matter of the Globe has taken
place in consequence of this agency.
From the most accurate observation it
appears nearly a hundred years would
be consumed before a single inch of
a Rock like that which this represents
or of Mount Blanch would be lost and
with regard to the ultimate termination
of such effects it is almost ridiculous
to reason seriously -
Man attached to the Globe has a limited
sphere of action limited faculties and
but a short period for the employment
