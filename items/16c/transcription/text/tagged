[misc]misc_677|[underline]Geology Lecture 3 1805[/underline][/misc]
The Science of Nature depends in a
great measure upon artificial inventions for
assisting the faculties of the mind and for
increasing the activity of genius.
And it requires for its advancement a State
of society in which active patronage is
offered; and in which it is assisted no less
by the diffusion of letters than by the
application of industry, riches and power
to its numerous and [deletion]diversified[/deletion]
diversified objects.-

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00004|dnp16c02pp|94869421[/page]
It is not therefore [deletion]necessary[/deletion] extraordinary
that the [underline]spirit[/underline] of observation and of
experiment, which maintained with difficulty
a sickly existance even in the most [underline]splendid[/underline]
and happy eras of [place]place_155|Rome[/place], should have
disappeared altogether at the [unclear]time[/unclear] of Her
decline and degradation when turbulence
at Home, feebleness abroad and indulgence
in the grossest luxury had prepared the
way for the total downfall of the state
[place]place_475|Egypt[/place] recorded as the parent of Science
in the most remote antiquity was destined

[page]5|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00005|dnp16c03pp|94869422[/page]
by a singular occurrence of circumstances
to become her [underline]nurse[/underline] in a later period
And philosophy driven from the West by
persecution by the ravages of Barbarians
and the tumult of savage warfare found
[underline]a transient refuge[/underline] within the walls [underline]of[/underline]
[underline][place]place_1135|Alexandria[/place].[/underline]
Towards the close of the fourth century
at the time when the [misc]misc_538|Goths[/misc] were conquering
the finest provinces of Europe and keeping
the Romans in continual alarm this city
enjoyed a profound peace and afforded
an asylum to Students from all parts
of [underline]the Empire[/underline] -

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00006|dnp16c04pp|94869423[/page]
The School of [place]place_1135|Alexandria[/place] produced several
laborious Geometricians; but the greatest
ornament belonging to it and the most
Illustrious Philosopher was [person]person_1049|Hypatia[/person] daughter
of [person]person_1050|Theon[/person] -
This celebrated lady is said to have
been equally distinguished for Her skill
in Mathematical in general science
and in the knowledge of Nature and
of the Earth.
And that She applied herself to
experiment is evident from one of her
invention the [misc]misc_850|Hydrometer[/misc] the instrument

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00007|dnp16c05pp|94869424[/page]
now in common use for ascertaining
the relative weights of fluids -
[person]person_1049|Hypatia[/person] taught after her fathers death
in her native city.- By the eloquence
and soundness of her doctrines she excited
the highest zeal for moral and intellectual
improvement amongst her disciples.
She was no less admirable for the grace
and loviliness of her person than for
talents and virtue and she shone with
greater lustre being as it were a
single brilliant Star in a night
of clouds and [underline]obscurity[/underline] -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00008|dnp16c06pp|94869425[/page]
Learning flourished at [place]place_1135|Alexandria[/place] for nearly
two hundred years; but literature and metaphysics
seem to have been more attended to than
experimental knowledge -
of the improvement made however we are
almost wholly ignorant.
For the [insertion]same[/insertion] causes which put a stop to
the future progress of science destroyed all
the records of the advancement that had
been made.
The city was conquered by the [misc]misc_273|Saracens[/misc]
and the most magnificent and perfect
library in the world burnt by the
command of [person]person_1051|[underline]omar[/underline][/person]

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00009|dnp16c07pp|94869426[/page]
Philosophy and letters were taken away
from the people and they were obliged
by the force of sword and of fire to
substitute for them the absurdities and
impostures of the [otherwork]otherwork_316|Koran.-[/otherwork]
All was again ignorance and darkness till
the eighth century when a feeble gleam
of light burst forth in [place]place_1212|Arabia[/place].
And the patronage of two celebrated Caliphs
[person]person_136|Al and[/person] [person]person_1052|Al kept alive[/person] for a
short time the spark of inquiry but at
this period there were no permanent materials
for it to act upon.
The spirit of Science and that of
[misc]misc_678|Mahometism[/misc] like the good and evil

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00010|dnp16c08pp|94869427[/page]
principles of Zoraster were incapable of
being reconciled.
Improvement languished in the reign of
the later Sovereigns of [place]place_1311|Baghdad[/place] and it
perished altogether with the Empire
which was one of the first that fell
beneath the rising power of the Turks.
Very few words of importance have been
transmitted to us from the [misc]misc_273|Saracens[/misc], and
the details that we are in possession of
with regard to the short literary history
of this people are principally valuable
on account of their connection about
the time of the crusades with the

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00011|dnp16c09pp|94869428[/page]
establishment of a particular [underline]philosophical[/underline]
sect in Europe which had the greatest
influence upon the progress of Natural
Science of chemistry and of Geology.
[person]person_1054|Gebir[/person] and [person]person_1053|Rhases[/person] of [place]place_1311|Bagdat[/place] are said
to have been the first men who
pursued the applications of Chemistry with the
view of ascertaining the nature of the
bodies belonging to the Earth and for
effecting changes in them -
And they are the philosophers to whom
the earliest Alchemists of the West
ascribe the origin of their Art.
Alchemy as at first professed was considered
as an universal [underline]Science[/underline]

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00012|dnp16c10pp|94869429[/page]
It was regarded not merely as affording
the means of converting other metals into
Gold and as providing remedies for all
Maladies; but as laying open the
great secret of Nature and as explaining
the phenomena of the Earth of the
sea of the Air and of the subterranean
mineral [deletion]kindom[/deletion] kingdom.
[person]person_061|Albertus Magnus[/person] and [person]person_324|Roger Bacon[/person]
who are the first persons recorded as
applying themselves to experiment in
the dark ages seem both to have been
guided by very philosophical views
and to have had as their principle

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00013|dnp16c11pp|94869430[/page]
objects the advancement of Science.
[person]person_324|the elder Bacon[/person] confesses in his great
work that He gained the foundation of
his knowledge from the Arabian writers
upon whom he bestows high and
unqualified praise.
This great man evidently studied
[underline]Nature[/underline] and the production of the Earth
with the views of a philosopher but
his knowledge was so superior as to be
unintelligible in the age in which he
lived. The wonders produced by chemistry
were referred by the people to [deletion]evil[/deletion]
[deletion]spirits[/deletion] the agency of evil spirits

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00014|dnp16c12pp|94869431[/page]
and a very short time after He had
written a book to prove the [underline]nonexistence[/underline]
[underline]of Magic[/underline] He was himself persecuted
as an [underline]enchanter[/underline], and He was imprisoned
in 1278 by the Franciscans for having brought
the order into disrepute by pretending
to [underline]natural wisdom[/underline] and by exercising
[underline]unholy[/underline] and [underline]supernatural powers[/underline]
[person]person_324|Roger Bacon[/person] appears to have
made use of the philosophical and
experimental method of the [misc]misc_273|Saracens[/misc]
without following any of the

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00015|dnp16c13pp|94869432[/page]
absurdities of their doctrines, He had seen
admirable changes produced in bodies and
He knew not the limits of the operation of Nature
By Him the [underline]production[/underline] of Gold and the
transmutation of [underline]Metals[/underline] were considered only
as [underline]objects[/underline] worthy of investigation; but
He never affirmed confidently concerning them.
He had made many important discoveries
and particularly that of [misc]misc_680|one expensive compound[/misc]
similar to Gunpowder -
And yet he seldom suffered his imagination
to cloud his reason and He was no
enthusiast with regard to the merit of
his inventions.-

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00016|dnp16c14pp|94869433[/page]
He possessed the modest and dignified feeling
of Science; but most of the Alchemists who
flourished in the next century were of a very
different complexion. They formed themselves
into a fraternity They professed to be
in possession of great and important [unclear]secrets[/unclear]
They connected a peculiar mysticism
with their philosophical doctrines.
They attached to Alchemy a language
similar to that which had been employed
in the [person]person_085|Platonic[/person] philosophy and they
pretended [deletion]to[/deletion] not only [deletion]to[/deletion] a knowledge
of the materials of the Globe and the

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00017|dnp16c15pp|94869434[/page]
changes of things but likewise to an
[deletion]organization[/deletion] acquaintance with the elemen[insertion]ts[/insertion]
and the spiritual powers by which they
supposed these were governed.-
The Arabians had blended in their
philosophy many brilliant superstitions
concerning the agency of a class of beings
supposed to be superior to Man and
possessed of great knowledge and of
high power.-
And the notion of fa[insertion]i[/insertion]ries and [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc]
which have been depicted with so much
vividness of fancy and loveliness of
description in [otherwork]otherwork_123|the thousand and one[line]nights[/otherwork] seems to have been adopted under a
new form.-

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00018|dnp16c16pp|94869435[/page]
By the adepts of this period [underline]in Europe[/underline] 
who though they altered the denominations
[underline]of the [deletion][unclear]serif[/unclear][/deletion] spiritual[/underline] [underline]Agents created[/underline]
by the fancy of [underline]the orientalists.[/underline] still
attribute to them similar attributes and
similar relations to Man.-
[person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] in his work on the [underline]occult[/underline]
[underline]Sciences[/underline] endeavours to devellope a general
system of the philosophy of the Earth
and He begins by supposing that all
things on the terrestrial Globe are
under the protection of influences residing
in the stars and of Good and evil [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc]
and that true knowledge can be derived
only from a communication with those

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00019|dnp16c17pp|94869436[/page]
spiritual beings.
[person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] considered [underline]fire[/underline] as the great
active principle in Nature and from
its operation upon earth which He regards
as a passive element He conceived the
great appearances of the external world
produced.-
Water and Air He thought were more
capable of being converted into each other
and yet He considered this as a vital
principle which existed in almost all
substances and as essential to their
composition and their nature.-

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00020|dnp16c18pp|94869437[/page]
This last passage is one of the few
philosophical ones in his work[deletion]s[/deletion] the
most worthy of notice: his pages are
generally filled with the grossest absurdities
It is difficult to conjecture from them
whether he is self deluded or whether
he is endeavouring to deceive others
whether his imagination was distempered
or whether he was attempting an
imposture
[person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] was born at [place]place_1312|Cologne[/place] in 1463
after the publication of his system
he was of course considered as a Magician
by the vulgar and a number of idle

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00021|dnp16c19pp|94869438[/page]
tales exist with regard to his History
He asserted that He was in possession of
the [misc]misc_381|Philosophers stone[/misc] yet He was always
miserably poor - He affirmed that He
had spirits under his command who were
capable of conveying him from place
to place and yet he passed the last
years of his life in [insertion]the[/insertion] prison of [place]place_356|Lyons:[/place]
where he was confined not because He
professed Magic but because He had
violently abused [person]person_1055|the Queen Mother of France.[/person]
The general systems of the famous
[person]person_509|[underline]paracelsus[/underline][/person] seem to have differed
very little from that of [person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] -

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00022|dnp16c20pp|94869439[/page]
He supposed the elements under the
influence of the stars and that all
the spaces in the universe void of
matter were filled with peculiar [underline]spiritual[/underline]
[underline]beings.[/underline]
And He has made sure of the very names
which have been so much employed in the
machinery of modern Poetry. Then he regarded
the [deletion]syp[/deletion] Sylphs and Gnomes as belonging
to the Earth and spectres to the air
and salamanders to the fire -
[person]person_509|Paracelsus[/person] introduced [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] and
[chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] into his Theory as principles
composing the metals and He regarded

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00023|dnp16c21pp|94869440[/page]
[underline]Animals[/underline] as chiefly constituted of Air and
vegetables of Earth.
The life of this man who was born in
[underline][place]place_198|Switzerland[/place][/underline] in 1493 was full of the most
extraordinary events. He travelled through
most of the Countries of Europe and Asia
and even passed a considerable time in
[place]place_222|Affrica[/place] seeking wherever he whent
for secrets in Chemistry, and professing
to cure all maladies.-
His enthusiasm almost supplied his want
of genius and confidence in his own
powers
He was appointed to the professor at
Bale but he soon contrived to disgust
the Magistrates and to gain a dismissal

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00024|dnp16c22pp|94869441[/page]
He was fond of living only amongst the lower
order of the people: and from associating
continually with the inferior, He acquired
the most offensive vanity the most insup-
-portable arrogance. He abused the physicians
of his time in the grossest terms.
He substituted chemical preparations for
vegetable medicines. And he publicly burns
the words of [person]person_1056|[underline]Avicenna[/underline][/person] saying that
there were no other masters in medicine
but Nature and himself.-
He passed his last days in wandering
about in [place]place_324|Germany[/place]. and when He was
reproached on account of his way of life

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00025|dnp16c23pp|94869442[/page]
He proudly answered that it was not fit
for a person born to succor the whole of
Mankind to attach himself to any one
spot and that He who was destined to
read the book of Nature ought not to
have his eyes fixed upon the same [underline]leaf[/underline].
[person]person_221|[underline]Van Helmont[/underline][/person] of [place]place_1147|Brussels[/place] like [person]person_509|[underline]paracelsus[/underline][/person]
was a mystic but He combined much
more sound philosophy in his views of
Nature and of the Earth -
He was a diligent experimenter and a
minute observer and some of his [deletion]research[/deletion]
researches led to important results.-

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00026|dnp16c24pp|94869443[/page]
He was the first person who supposed that
[chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical] existed different from the
Air of the Atmosphere and [underline]from him[/underline]
we derive the modern [underline]chemical[/underline] name [underline]of Gas[/underline]
He likewise invented another denomination
[misc]misc_852|[underline]Blas[/underline][/misc] which is not quite so intelligible -
He considered it as of a much finer
nature than Air; and as being derived
by the Earth and from the sun and stars -
[person]person_221|Van Helmont[/person] made some very laborious
experiments to prove that water was
capable of being converted into [underline]Earth[/underline]
and He [underline]revived [/underline]the the doctrine of
[person]person_609|Thales[/person] that it was the general productive
principle.-

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00027|dnp16c25pp|94869444[/page]
The Sixteenth century was the [underline]great[/underline]
[underline]era[/underline] in which the mystical adept flourished.
The famous [misc]misc_410|Rosicrucian[/misc] Society seems
to have been established about this time
by them.
And the history of this Institution is secret
as obscure as that of the kindred Sect of
the modern illuminees.-
It would be of little use and foreign
to the objects of these lectures to enter upon
an examination of all the writings published
on Alchemy in different parts of Europe
by Valentine by Fludd by [person]person_1105|Boemen[/person] and others

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00028|dnp16c26pp|94869445[/page]
And I should not have given any [unclear]sketch[/unclear]
even of the doctrines of the adepts
had not some of their labours been
immediately connected with the progress
of true [underline]chemical[/underline] and [underline]geological[/underline]
[underline]knowledge[/underline].-
They were experimenters with false
views but they nevertheless sometimes
develloped truth.-
They were indefatigable in their
research and they had ascertained
a number of the most curious properties
of bodies without being able to account
philosophically for their effects -

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00029|dnp16c27pp|94869446[/page]
Though visionaries they sometimes acted
according to the dictates of right reason
As persons who walk in their sleep [deletion]perform[/deletion]
sometimes perform in a proper manner
the common occupations of life.-
The facts scattered amongst their absurdities
were valuable in the highest degree to
the philosophical men who came after
them.
And a true and enlightened [underline]science[/underline]
arose by degree and amidst clouds
and obscurity from the [insertion]furnaces[/insertion][deletion]furnaces[/deletion]
of the [underline]Alchemists[/underline].

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00030|dnp16c28pp|94869447[/page]
|_George [person]person_062|Agricola[/person] was the [underline]first person[/underline]
who published [deletion]on[/deletion] practical mineralogy
and on Geological chemistry in the
16 century. His work on the metals
contain a number of important [deletion]facts[/deletion]
truths which are always detailed with
peculiar candour and modesty -
He describes the general [underline]position[/underline] of
the veins in the great mineral
countries of [place]place_324|Germany[/place].
He gives a natural history of ores and
a particular account of the manner
in which the are worked and in [underline]none[/underline]
[underline]of his details [/underline]does He enter upon

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00031|dnp16c29pp|94869448[/page]
wild speculations and He has treated the
professed adepts of his age with a cool
and dignified [deletion]un[/deletion] indifference. -
[person]person_1059|Lazarus Erckern[/person] assay Master General
to the German mines was Co[insertion]n[/insertion]temporary [underline]with[/underline]
[underline][person]person_062|Agricola[/person][/underline]. His work on the art of assaying
has been translated into English by [person]person_1060|Sir[line]John Pettus[/person] and it contains much
valuable matter with regard to metallur-
-gical Chemistry.
Both [person]person_062|Agricola[/person] and [person]person_1059|Erckern[/person] considered
the metals as incapable of being transmuted
into each other and they regarded
them as produced by certain operations of
Nature which cannot be imitated by
artificial means.-

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00032|dnp16c30pp|94869449[/page]
The period in which these two
[underline]mineralogists[/underline]wrote was the great era
of improvement in the general methods
of the natural sciences.-
It was the period in which the
death blow was given to Alchemy by
[person]person_757|Gassendi[/person] and [deletion]Kelp[/deletion] [person]person_363|Kepler[/person] who both
answered for Fludd the last public
defender of the Rosicrusians -
It was the period in which [underline][person]person_283|Gallileo[/person][/underline]
pursued the paths of experimental
enquiry; And in which [person]person_124|the second[line]illustrous Bacon[/person] had the honour of

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00033|dnp16c31pp|94869450[/page]
establishing [underline]the Sciences[/underline] upon their
true and immutable foundations.-
Many scientific persons [person]person_124|[underline]before Bacon[/underline][/person]
had pursued the method of Experiment
in all its precision, many had dared
to despise the logic and forms of the
ancients, but He was the [underline]first[/underline]
[underline]philosopher[/underline] who laid down plans for
extending knowledge of universal application
who ventured to assert that all the sciences
could be nothing more than expressions
of facts and that the first step towards
the attainment of real discovery was
the humiliating confession of [underline]ignorance[/underline]

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00034|dnp16c32pp|94869451[/page]
Bacon was prepared by Nature by
education and by his habit of study for
effecting the great revolution in philosophy
His knowledge was extensive his instances
were copious. His Genius was equally
capable of develloping the lighter and
the more profound relations of things.
He professed a strong feeling but it
was uniformly directed by [underline]reason[/underline] -
He was gifted with a vivid imagination
but it was modified by a most correct
taste - 
The influence of rank and of situation
assisted his views - The public was prepared
to receive them, and he was enabled

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00035|dnp16c33pp|94869452[/page]
to devellope his opinions with full
confidence that they would be adopted
with reverence even in his own time and
that they would carry his memory into
future ages with [underline]great[/underline] and [underline]with[/underline]
unchanging Glory.-
+ The pursuit of the new method of investigat[insertion]ion[/insertion]
in a very short time wholly altered the
face of every department of Natural
Knowledge but their influence was in
no case more distinct that in the advance[insertion]ment[/insertion]
of Geology and chemistry; though much
labour had been bestowed upon these
extensive fields of investigation they
had hitherto as we have seen been little
productive.-

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00036|dnp16c34pp|94869453[/page]
Speculation had been misplaced observation
confined and experiment principally
directed rather towards impossible than
to practicable things.
in the [underline]novel system[/underline] [underline]hypotheses[/underline] was
exploded except as a guide to [underline]actual[/underline]
[deletion]truths[/deletion] [underline]trials[/underline] - Combinations of thoughts
were considered as truths only when
conformable [underline]to Nature[/underline] and not [deletion]merely[/deletion]
when they merely expressed the caprices
of the imagination and those enquiries
only were regarded as valuable which
were made upon the hidden sensible
properties of things and upon the
existing relations of facts.

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00037|dnp16c35pp|94869454[/page]
(One of the first persons who applied [underline]with[/underline]
[underline]zeal[/underline] to the investigation of the Theory of
the Earth after enlightened views and
distinct plans was [underline][person]person_246|Robert Hooke[/person][/underline]
I [deletion]have[/deletion] mentioned in a former lecture that the

But I can with pleasure mention him again
His genius was [deletion]however[/deletion] too powerful
and too active to be limited to [deletion]any[/deletion]
[deletion]the pursuit[/deletion] [insertion]these[deletion]greater objects[/deletion] considerable objects[/insertion] and in the course of his
scientific career he applied his [underline]great[/underline]
[underline]abilities[/underline] to almost all the principal
objects of investigation in [underline]Natural[/underline]
[underline]Science[/underline].

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00038|dnp16c36pp|94869455[/page]

the refinements of Theory in modern times.
Few men have done more than [person]person_246|Hooke[/person]
and few have been more neglected and
one of the principal reasons is that
He was the contemporary of [person]person_036|[underline]Newton[/underline][/person]
whose just Glory and whose splendid
discoveries concerning the great laws
of the universe absorbed the attention
of the philosophers of the age and

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00039|dnp16c37pp|94869456[/page]
and made them almost regardless

[underline]shells and the[/underline] [deletion]and the[/deletion] remains of
[underline]marine[/underline] animals in rocks and in hills
of [underline]considerable elevation[/underline] draws the
conclusions, that these strata must have
been at some period covered by the sea
And after reasoning upon the general
[underline]effects of Earthquakes[/underline] and of Volcanic
explosions He infers that there are
no causes in nature more probable than

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00040|dnp16c38pp|94869457[/page]
these for the elevation of land of rock
and of mountains from the bosom
of the waters.
He brings forward many chemical
instances "to shew" that water is capable
of dissolving and of depositing stoney
matter and that its agency is fully
adequate to the formation of strata.
And He shews that both in modern and
in ancient times several cases have
occurred of Islands and of tracts of Land
rising out of the sea in consequence
of submarine Volcanoes -
The ideas of [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] are conceived with
boldness and develloped with precision,

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00041|dnp16c39pp|94869458[/page]
In many principal parts of Theory He
had anticipated the modern [person]person_085|Platonic[/person]
Philosophers: He seems however to have
restrained his imagination. He has
contented himself with demonstrating a
certain part of the existing order of
Nature without attempting a general
system of the past change of the Globe
and of its future destiny -
Beccher lived at the same period
as [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] like [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] He devoted his life
to Science; but He selected one
department and directed to Geological
[deletion]Gelogi[/deletion] chemistry the whole of the
power of his [deletion]genius[/deletion]mind -

In his book called [otherwork]otherwork_317|subterranean philosophy[/otherwork]
published in latin in 1669
He has given some very beautiful
details with regard to the Mineral
Kingdom and has offered views of
Theory perfectly new - his ideas
concerning combination and decomposit
are of the most accurate nature
his notion of an inflamable principle
formed the foundation of the hypothesis
of Hall - He gave to chemical philosophy
new dominions and new instruments of
investigation and He attempted to form
a [deletion]general[/deletion] Theory in which all the
operations of Nature should be explained

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00043|dnp16c41pp|94869460[/page]
illustrated by experiments of human invention
Beccher with the sound judgment of
a true philosopher assumes a certain
primary order of things resulting from
the creation of the Globe and He applies
only to the solution of the phaenomena
of the change, which have since taken
place
[underline]Water in the mineral kingdom[/underline] and
elastic vapours He considers as the great
agents which have altered the position
of strata and the direction of metalic
veins and from the decomposition of
certain rocks by these natural agents
he supposes that new ones have been
formed of a much [underline]softer nature[/underline] and

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00044|dnp16c42pp|94869461[/page]
fitted to become soils and to support
vegetable Life -
Beccher was born at spire in 1645
He was for some time professor of medicine
at [place]place_1128|Bavaria[/place] but He was driven from
[place]place_324|Germany[/place] by envy and persecution.
[place]place_121|England[/place] became his adopted Country He
was patronized by the great [person]person_103|Boyle[/person] in
consequence of whose liberality He was
enabled to study mineralogy in
[place]place_021|Cornwall[/place] to further his experimental
researches and to produce some of those
works on Natural Science which
will always confer honour on
his name -

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00045|dnp16c43pp|94869462[/page]
Hook and Beccher had contented themselves
with [underline]partial views[/underline];
And the celebrated [person]person_1005|[underline]Leibnitz[/underline][/person] is the first
philosopher who attempted a [underline]general[/underline]
[underline]system[/underline] of Geology -
In his - [otherwork]otherwork_318|[insertion]Protogaea[/insertion][/otherwork] published in 1693 He enters
upon the [underline]great doctrines[/underline] relating to [underline]the Globe[/underline]
the primary creation, [underline]the deluge[/underline] the changes
that have been since produced and that
will be produced in [underline]future ages[/underline] -
He assumes as the foundation of his reasoning
the account of the creation given in the
[underline]sacred writings[/underline];-
And He attempts to shew that the
Globe at its origin must have existed in

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00046|dnp16c44pp|94869463[/page]
a state of igneous fusion in consequence of
which it assumed its [underline]spherical form[/underline];
The heavier substances such as the metals
He supposes to have occupied the centre
and He conceives that the Rocks; which
crystalized at first in regular strata were
afterwards broken and raised into mountains
by explosions taking place from beneath
and the Chasms produced and filled with
metalic veins.-
The water which at first existed as
highly rarified vapour He supposed to have
been by degrees condensed and from its
action in its heated state upon the

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00047|dnp16c45pp|94869464[/page]
Land He conceives that a part of the
surface was decomposed broken down and
converted into a soil on which by the
Almighty [unclear]fiat[/unclear] vegetables and Animals
were made to exist and the whole cloathed
with beauty and rendered [underline]subservient[/underline]
to the purposes of [deletion]life[/deletion] [underline]the last[/underline] created
and most perfect [underline]of beings[/underline]
[person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] supposes that there may have
been two causes for the deluge:-
The elevation of Land in the former bed
of the Ocean in consequence of explosions
from the central ignited mass: and
[underline]the passage of the tail of a Comet[/underline] -

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00048|dnp16c46pp|94869465[/page]
[underline]through the Atmosphere loaded with[/underline]
[underline]aqueous[/underline] vapour -
By the first cause He explains the
passage in [otherwork]otherwork_281|Geneis[/otherwork] "The fountains of the
great deep were broken up and by the
second the other sentence the windows
of heaven were opened and the rain
was upon the Earth for forty days
and forty Nights.-
[person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] supposes that the principal
changes which have taken place since
[underline]the deluge[/underline] have depended either upon
Volcanic fires: or great inundations
from the Ocean and He conceives

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00049|dnp16c47pp|94869466[/page]
that fire and Water are Counterballancing
powers by which an order of things
similar to the present will be maintained
till the great and general conflagration
Such is the doctrine of the [otherwork]otherwork_318|Protogaea[/otherwork]
as found in the excellent edition of the
works of [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] by [person]person_1061|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Dutens.-[/person]
The work it self is in the highest degree
deserving of a minute examination -
It is worthy of the Genius of the Illustrious
Author:-
When facts are stated in it they are
detailed with clearness and accuracy
and where Hypotheses are indulged

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00050|dnp16c48pp|94869467[/page]
in; they mark an imagination fertile
in novelty and pregnant with
bold conceptions.-
That his [underline]reasoning is not always[/underline] convincing
rater depends upon his endeavouring to
resolve problems concerning which there
no data than upon any imperfection
in his methods -
The subject which He has undertaken
[underline]to discuss[/underline] is one almost above the powers
of the human mind.
It required high talents to produce
any philosophical views with regard
to it and the abilities of [deletion]Lebn[/deletion]

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00051|dnp16c49pp|94869468[/page]
[person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] where they have not develloped
actual [underline]truth[/underline] have uniformaly produced
some brilliant semblance to reality in
which the fancy always and sometimes
even the [underline]reason[/underline] can dwell with delight
The [otherwork]otherwork_318|protogea[/otherwork] has been very little known
but many writers appear to have borrowed
from it -
[person]person_519|Whiston[/person] adopted the Idea of a comet
having produced the Deluge: and has
endeavoured to prove it from mathematical
deductions - His treatise is however very
much inferior in precision to that of
the prussian philosopher and contains
no ideas remarkable either for strength or novelty

Another system which appeared about the
same time as that of [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] has excited
infinitely more attention in [place]place_159|Britain[/place]
I mean the [otherwork]otherwork_319|sacred Theory of the [deletion]New[/deletion][/otherwork]
Earth by [person]person_1001|[underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Burnet[/underline][/person]
In this work the Globe is supposed
to have been created without irregularities
[underline]perfectly spherical[/underline] and smooth having
neither Hills Mountains nor Vallies -
The land is supposed to Have been
equally diffused above the Ocean
and to have covered it as a thin

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00053|dnp16c51pp|94869470[/page]
Crust and the deluge is considered as
having been occasioned by the breaking
down of the land into the great abyss
beneath an event which He supposes to
have produced all the varieties of Sea
and Earth that present exist the
formation of Islands and the great
[underline]elevation of Continents[/underline] -
Burnet paints with all the feeling
of an enthusiast the [underline]delightful state[/underline]
of the inhabitants of the Globe before
the deluge in his hypotheses as there
could have been no variety of Seasons
He conceives that they must have
enjoyed a [underline]perpetual Spring[/underline];

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00054|dnp16c52pp|94869471[/page]
that the face of Heaven and the Sun
and the Stars must have been exhibited
to them in unclouded beauty.
And that the whole of the Earth
must have been green with perpetual
vegetation.
Burnet saw none of the errors of his
system - He did not perceive that
without the action of the waters of the
sea upon the atmosphere there could
be no rain no dews no rivers and
consequently no plants and no animal life
His mode of accounting for the moistening
of the Earth by the filtration of water
through the solid matter and its

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00055|dnp16c53pp|94869472[/page]
elevation into the air is [underline]perfectly inadmiss[/underline]-
[underline]ible[/underline] and every one must allow that the
feeling and taste of the [misc]misc_853|Antediluvians[/misc]
must have been very different from ours
If they could derive more pleasure from
the contemplation of a flat surface and
an uniform sky than from the view
of the variety of hill and dale of
mountain and river scenery and
the ever varying appearances of clouds
[person]person_1062|[underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Keil[/underline][/person] in his [otherwork]otherwork_320|examination of the[line][underline]sacred Theory[/underline][/otherwork] has distinctly proved
that it is wholly incompatable with the
general laws of the Globe and not
conformable in the slightest degree to facts -

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00056|dnp16c54pp|94869473[/page]
As a poetical Romance it is highly
interesting and entertaining but as
a philosophical opinion it is wholly
unworthy of [deletion]opinion[/deletion] attention and it
affords one proof amongst many others
of the folly of attempts to wrest the
meaning of the sacred writings
which express general truths so as
to make them serve as supports for
hypotheses of human invention so as
to blend them with the visions
and fancies of men - _|

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00057|dnp16c55pp|94869474[/page]
The last system which I shall mention in
this Lecture is that of [person]person_266|[underline]Buffon[/underline][/person].-
|_One of the most singular and extraordinary
productions of the human mind, beauties and
defects are blended in it and it is complete
with ingenuity and with errors.
|_[person]person_266|Buffons[/person] idea of the primary state of the Globe
is wholly borrowed [person]person_1005|[underline]from Leibnitz[/underline].[/person] He conceives
it to have existed in igneous fusion; but despising
the modern opinion of the Author of the
[otherwork]otherwork_318|Protogaea[/otherwork] that such was its [underline]primary creation[/underline] -
He supposes it to have been produced from
the ruins of another system to have been
carried off from the Sun by the powerful
impulse of a Comet and to have been moved -

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00058|dnp16c56pp|94869475[/page]
into its present orbit by and the
force of gravity -
He fixes the era at which this great event
is supposed to have taken place at a
distance of time quite inconceivable -
And He imagines three [underline]different epochs[/underline]
in [underline]the history[/underline] of the cooling of the
surface [underline]before[/underline] [underline]Marine Animals[/underline] existed
and five epochs before it was fitted for
the residence of Land Animals & of Man -
[person]person_266|Buffon[/person] brings forward two principal
arguments in the support of his htypothesis
and they are now both known to be
founded upon false principles -

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00059|dnp16c57pp|94869476[/page]
His first is that the temperature of the
Earth is found higher the farther we
penetrate beneath the surface
The second is that the surface of the
Earth is composed of matters which are
almost all capable of being [chemical]chemical_509|vitrified[/chemical]
by Heat -
Now it is well ascertained that except
in [underline]volcanic countries[/underline] at a considerable
depth is the mean temperature of [underline]the[/underline]
[underline]Atmosphere[/underline] and that it varies according
to that mean in all the different
climates so that it is evidently produced
not by internal but by external causes
not, by a [deletion]cont[/deletion] central fire but by the solar
rays and the heat of the Air -

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00060|dnp16c58pp|94869477[/page]
With regard to the other propositions
it is certain that the greater number
of [underline]our Rocks[/underline] are wholly incapable of
being fused by any Heat that we
are able to apply to them;
And though it is not improbable in
a temperature such as that of the Sun
they would become liquid; yet we
have no right to make inference merely
for the sake of forming [underline]a Theory[/underline]
For a theory ought in all cases to be
+ not an expression of conjecture but
an arrangement of facts.
The ideas of [person]person_266|Buffon[/person] concerning the
changes of the Globe that are now

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00061|dnp16c59pp|94869478[/page]
taking place and the general order
[underline]of Nature[/underline] are scarcely less bold or less
visionary than his notions concerning
the origin of things -
He conceives that the land and the sea
are continually changing places. that
from the action of rains of Rivers and of
torrents the solid matter of the land is
constantly divided decomposed and deposited
in the Ocean.
In which carried by currents towards
the equator it is again accumulated
in strata and formed by the [unclear]powers[/unclear]
of aqueous consolidation into new Rocks
and new mountains which rise at
length above the waves and offer

[page]62|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00062|dnp16c60pp|94869479[/page]
a due compensation for the destruction
of parts of ancient continents and Islands
This Hypothesis in which the waters
of the Atmosphere are supposed to be
the destroying cause and the water
of the sea the regenerating cause
of [underline]the solid land[/underline] is supported by the
Author with considerable address and
ingenuity -
He endeavours to prove from the
shells and remains of fishes found in
some parts of high mountains that
the present continents must have been
formed in the bed of the ocean -

[page]63|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00063|dnp16c61pp|94869480[/page]
[insertion][unclear]He endeavours to[/unclear][/insertion]He endeavours to shew that some of the Islands
under the equator have been very lately
raised - And He brings forward many
accurate instances which demonstrate
that the sea has gained upon the land
to some extent in many different
parts of Europe.-
I shall not at present enter upon a full
discussion of these opinions for they will
again occupy our attention in the
examination of a much more comprehensive
and [otherwork]otherwork_097|more artfully constructed theory[/otherwork] that
of [person]person_125|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton.[/person]
I shall merely offer a few general
observations upon them.-

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00064|dnp16c62pp|94869481[/page]
With regard to the idea that our present
land was formed in the bosom of the
sea by the mere action of water is
is one that may be controverted and
overturned with ease.-
The greatest portion of our high rocks
and elevated mountains are chrystalized
masses containing no organic remains
and not arranged in layers and they
consist of matter wholly incapable of
being consolidated by water such is
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] which forms a considerable
part of the [place]place_247|Alps[/place] which constitutes
the great mountains of [place]place_235|Scotland[/place] and
the hills and cliffs of [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place].-

[page]65|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00065|dnp16c63pp|94869482[/page]
And stratified rocks even which seem
themselves to have been deposited by
water are often blended with rocks of
another description so as rather to indicate
a great inundation and rapid transit
of the ocean over [underline]the land[/underline] than a
gradual and [underline]quite deposition[/underline] of the
solid matter of the earth in the bed of the sea.
It is impossible to doubt that in the
lapse of ages some slight [unclear]dimunition[/unclear]
of our mountains must take place from
the [underline]agency of rivers[/underline] but there are many
causes in Nature which appears
to counteract the effect.

[page]66|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00066|dnp16c64pp|94869483[/page]
Centuries nearly have passed away and
no material change in the form of the
solid matter of the Globe has taken
place in consequence of this agency.
From the most accurate observation it
appears nearly a hundred years would
be consumed before a single inch of
a Rock like that which this represents
or of [place]place_1315|Mount Blanch[/place] would be lost and
with regard to the ultimate termination
of such effects it is almost ridiculous
to reason seriously -
Man attached to the Globe has a limited
sphere of action limited faculties and
but a short period for the employment

[page]67|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00067|dnp16c65pp|94869484[/page]
of them -
He was not intended to waste his time in
guesses concerning what is to take place
in infinite duration but He was rather
born to reason from the past and the
present concerning his immediate and
future destinies and philosophy as well
as in common life He [deletion]only[/deletion] ought only
to be guided by certainties by distinct
probabilities or by strong analogies -
To conclude after censuring [person]person_266|M. Buffons[/person]
wilder speculations it would be unfair
to deny to him the highest praise for
order of arrangement splendor of description
and brilliancy of stile -

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00068|dnp16c66pp|94869485[/page]
He has adorned a subject of the most
abstracted kind in the refined charms
and elegancies of literature and He
has bestowed on it an interest which
it had never professed before.
His merit in this respect is
transcendent - there is nothing highly
difficult in the task of delineating
[underline]Human character[/underline] in painting the
passions and affections of the mind,
with eloquence and with feeling -
for these belong to all minds, all
climes and all ages and their
effects are [deletion]universal[/deletion] universal -

[page]69|MS-DAVY-11603-000-00069|dnp16c67pp|94869486[/page]
But to cloath [insertion]the[/insertion] dull and dead objects
of a speculative branch of science in
the form of beauty and to infuse into
them animation and life -
This is indeed a work which the strongest
genius only can accomplish; and it
is a work in which [person]person_266|Buffon[/person] has
perfectly [underline]succeeded[/underline].-
