In considering this circumstance Whitehurst<lb/>

common to Scientific Men that they had<lb/>

supposing that they had been raised<lb/>
from the bottom of the ocean by the<lb/>
same fires which He conceived to<lb/>

During the rise of new continents<lb/>
and islands assumed to have taken place<lb/>
it necessarily follows that the waters<lb/>
must have flowed in upon the lands already<lb/>
            <hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

at this period its axis may have gained<lb/>
