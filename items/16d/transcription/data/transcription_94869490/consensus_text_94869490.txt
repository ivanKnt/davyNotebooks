Buffon in his theory of the Globe
supports that the surface is constantly
becoming colder
M de Maillet on the other hand conceives
that it is daily growing warmer
The first attempts to prove that ice
in the course of ages will extend even
to the countries under the trop[deletion]p[/deletion]ics
Whilst the last conceives that in no
very distant period it will disappear
even from the poles
The one Author fears unless the energies
of the Sun are capable of opposing
the laws of nature our cultivated
lands will become snow clad plains
