I have mentioned this hypothesis because
it is the foundation of the idea of the
gradually increasing temperature of the
[underline]Land[/underline]. For M. de Maillet justly conceives
that if water disappears Fire must accumulate
and that the [underline]dry surface[/underline] must soon become
inhabitable.
All his observation of facts however are
partial and his notion of the dissipation
of the moisture of our globe into space
shows a total ignorance of the laws of
[underline]evaporation[/underline] which long before the
time of the publication of his work
had been fully [deletion]develop[/deletion] develloped
by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hally.-
