This excellent Philosopher has proved from
the most accurate data that the fluid
raised from the ocean and the surface of
the Earth in consequence of the solar
heat is condensed by cold in the upper
regions of the air and that from its
deposition clouds are produced and dew
and rain which water the Earth and
support vegetable [deletion]life[/deletion] and animal life
and form rivers that return the
superfluous moisture into the sea
its [underline]parent source[/underline].
