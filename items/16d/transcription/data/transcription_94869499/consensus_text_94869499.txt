about the period when some of the most
brilliant discoveries ever made with regard
to intimate Nature of bodies were brought
to light by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestly and M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bergman.
Whitehurst was evidently [underline]gifted[/underline] with
[underline]an indefatigable spirit of investigation[/underline]
similar to that which actuated those
celebrated men: and his labours though
directed toward objects much more obscure
and more difficultly attainable have
have been highly meritorious and
productive of important results.-
