In considering this circumstance Whitehurst
was led to form the conclusion almost
common to Scientific Men that they had
been covered by the Sea:
And he immediately connected the cause
of the [underline]deluge[/underline] with their [underline]present elevation[/underline]
supposing that they had been raised
from the bottom of the ocean by the
same fires which He conceived to
have produced their irregularities.-
During the rise of new continents
and islands assumed to have taken place
it necessarily follows that the waters
must have flowed in upon the lands already
[underline]existing.[/underline].-
