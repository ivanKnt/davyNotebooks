The lower strata of the air would
in consequence soon become impure
and unfit for the purposes of life -
And on these ideas allowing the
Hypotheses the Antediluvians instead of
being gently warmed by a perpetual
summer would have been chilled by
the frosts of an eternal winter -
Instead of breathing a purer and
more etherial fluid they would have
been exposed to an atmosphere filled
with noxious and suffocating vapours.
