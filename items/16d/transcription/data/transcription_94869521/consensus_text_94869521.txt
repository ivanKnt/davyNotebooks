when He regards this light as different
from [underline]the solar light[/underline] it is impossible
to follow with pleasure the wandering
of his [underline]imagination[/underline] it is impossible
not to express a wish, that He
[underline]had rather[/underline] confined his active and
[underline]powerful Genius[/underline] to observations and
to reasonings upon probabilities
than have suffered it to waste its
strength in vain attempts to penetrate
into mystries which have been wisely
concealed from Man and the Knowledge
of which even if it could be obtained
would be comparatively useless.-
