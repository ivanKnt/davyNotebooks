The masterly experiments of Sir James
Hall have indeed [underline]shewn[/underline] that Basalt
rendered fluid in our furnaces may be
chrystalized by a slow diminution of
[underline]temperature[/underline] and that Limestone may be
[deletion]rendered fluid[/deletion] [insertion]fused [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] under great pressure
without loosing any of the [deletion]fixed air[/deletion]
[deletion]or Carbonic acid[/deletion] [insertion]elastic fluid[/insertion] with which it is combined
But no strong analogies can be applied
from these most interesting facts, to [underline]Granite[/underline]
to the regularly formed gems or to any
of the perfectly aggregated Rocks
