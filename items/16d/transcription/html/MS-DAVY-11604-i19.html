            <p>Regional name for a type of igneous rock found between layers of limestone rock in
               Derbyshire, England. John Whitehurst wrote about it in his 1778 Enquiry into the Original
               State and Formation of the Earth, suggesting that the rock was igneous rather than
               sedimentary.</p>
