[underline][underline]Geology Lecture 4 1805[/underline][/underline]
It has often happened during the
progress of science that two doctrines
immediately opposite have been supposed
with great powers of reasoning and almost
with equal plausibility
Such a circumstance however almost
always marks the infancy of the
study and the imperfection of the
methods of investigation .
It proves that speculation has been
merely employed [deletion]or[/deletion] or partial
facts only examined.

[page]4||dnp16d02pp|94869489[/page]
And the Philosophical enquirer in
opposing supposition to supposition
and error to error will instantly percieve
the insufficiency of either class of
opinions: and will thus preserve
the mind free from doubt from the
prejudice of false systems from mistakes
and confusion.-
This method may be sometimes
applied with [insertion]great[/insertion] success in the examination
of Geological Theories.
It removes the necessity of strict
discussion and it often devellopes
absurdity without the assistance
of[deletion] labour[/deletion] laborious logical deductions

[page]5||dnp16d03pp|94869490[/page]
Buffon in his theory of the Globe
supports that the surface is constantly
becoming colder
M de Maillet on the other hand conceives
that it is daily growing warmer
The first attempts to prove that ice
in the course of ages will extend even
to the countries under the trop[deletion]p[/deletion]ics
Whilst the last conceives that in no
very distant period it will disappear
even from the poles
The one Author fears unless the energies
of the Sun are capable of opposing
the laws of nature our cultivated
lands will become snow clad plains

[page]6||dnp16d04pp|94869491[/page]
And the other dreads their conversion into
burning deserts of sand, incapable of 
supporting vegetable life -
It is scarcely possible to imagine two
hypotheses in more perfect opposition; both
have been defended with ingenuity both
are founded upon mistakes -
The one may be ballanced against the
other there will be scarcely a perceptible
difference in their weight and importance
and they may be safely be given up together.
The [underline]work[/underline] of M. de Maillet on Geology
is called [underline]Telliamed[/underline] which is an anagram
of his name a translation of it appeared

[page]7||dnp16d05pp|94869492[/page]
in English in 1750 -
The Author professes to devellope the
opinions of an indian philosopher whom
he had met at Cairo when the Consul
General of France was in that City.
Though he intended to produce a
philosophical Theory He has given it
in the form of a [underline]Romance[/underline] for the
fables are more numerous than the facts
and it affords much entertainment
but little or no instruction.
M. de Maillet from having observed an
increase of Land on several parts of
the coast of the Mediterranean conceives

[page]8||dnp16d06pp|94869493[/page]
that there must be an uniform law of
diminution of the Sea in consequence
of which the whole surface must at
length become dry land.
His opinion is very similar to that
ancient one of [underline]Leucippus[/underline].
And he farther supposes that the whole
of the Globe in Early ages was covered
with water: and that from the slow
and gradual disappearance of the [underline]Ocean[/underline]
our present islands and continents
have been formed and the existing
order of things produced -

[page]9||dnp16d07pp|94869494[/page]
I have mentioned this hypothesis because
it is the foundation of the idea of the
gradually increasing temperature of the
[underline]Land[/underline]. For M. de Maillet justly conceives
that if water disappears Fire must accumulate
and that the [underline]dry surface[/underline] must soon become
inhabitable.
All his observation of facts however are
partial and his notion of the dissipation
of the moisture of our globe into space
shows a total ignorance of the laws of
[underline]evaporation[/underline] which long before the
time of the publication of his work
had been fully [deletion]develop[/deletion] develloped
by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hally.-

[page]10||dnp16d08pp|94869495[/page]
This excellent Philosopher has proved from
the most accurate data that the fluid
raised from the ocean and the surface of
the Earth in consequence of the solar
heat is condensed by cold in the upper
regions of the air and that from its
deposition clouds are produced and dew
and rain which water the Earth and
support vegetable [deletion]life[/deletion] and animal life
and form rivers that return the
superfluous moisture into the sea
its [underline]parent source[/underline].

[page]11||dnp16d09pp|94869496[/page]
According to this beautiful system the foundations
of which [underline]are distinct truths[/underline] there is a
constant circulation of moisture upon our Globe.
No portion rises above the atmosphere
no portion is lost: and amidst a variety of
combinations and [underline]decompositions[/underline], the equilibrium
is preserved  the quantity is unimpaired: and
there is a constant application of it to the
uses of [underline]living beings[/underline].-
Most of the important errors of the early
Geological systems of the moderns may indeed
be referred to a want of acquaintance in
their Authors with the great facts blonging
to the order of Nature: and to an
ignorance of the real essence of the
[deletion]subterraneans[/deletion] subterranean [underline]Kingdom[/underline].

[page]12||dnp16d10pp|94869497[/page]
|_[underline]Chemistry[/underline] and [underline]minerology[/underline] till the
middle of the last century were merely
in the embryon state without order or
beauty:
And they offer the only true and permanent
foundations on which a given Theory
of the Earth can be erected.
Not even the genius of a becker or a
Hooke not even the minutely enquiring
spirit of a woodward nor the imagination
of a Buffon could supply the want of
and extended system of experimental
Knowledge.
And it was not till chemical
analysis had discovered the real composition
And it was not till chemical
an extended system of experimental
analysis had discovered the real composition

[page]13||dnp16d11pp|94869498[/page]
of mineral bodies and given accuracy
to the [underline]systems[/underline] of Classification,
It was not till this period that the
changes taking place in the surface of
the Globe in the present time could
be accurately ascertained or any true
analogical evidences gained of the
intimate nature of the revolutions which
had occurred in past ages.-
One of the first persons who endeavored
to employ real mineralogical and chemical
knowledge in the [underline]solution[/underline] of the most
remarkable appearances of the surface of the
Globe was the late M[superscript]r[/superscript] Whitehurst.
His enquiry into the state and formation
of the earth was published in 1778,

[page]14||dnp16d12pp|94869499[/page]
about the period when some of the most
brilliant discoveries ever made with regard
to intimate Nature of bodies were brought
to light by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestly and M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bergman.
Whitehurst was evidently [underline]gifted[/underline] with
[underline]an indefatigable spirit of investigation[/underline]
similar to that which actuated those
celebrated men: and his labours though
directed toward objects much more obscure
and more difficultly attainable have
have been highly meritorious and
productive of important results.-

[page]15||dnp16d13pp|94869500[/page]
Whitehurst passed the early part of his life
in Derbyshire.
And it was from an observation of the
many interesting phenomena of the
mineral kingdom which occur upon a
great scale in that County that he was
first induced to direct his attention to
Geology not so much as He himself informs
us with a view of constructing a Theory
as with the hope of obtaining such
a competent knowledge of subterraneous
Geography as might be applicable to
useful purpose and to discoveries in
[underline]Mining[/underline] -

[page]16||dnp16d14pp|94869501[/page]
His attention was however soon arested
by a fact which it was scarcely
possible for an active mind to notice
without indulging in speculation
without reasoning from effects concerning
causes.-
The principal strata in Derbyshire are
Sandstone slate coal and limestone in some cases
they are parallel to the horizon and regular in
their disposition. but in other cases they are
considerably broken and inclined.
In some districts of the [deletion]conty[/deletion]county
a substance is found called by the Miners
toad stone which is in fact a species of
Basalt and where this Rock occurs in

[page]17||dnp16d15pp|94869502[/page]
The greatest quantity, " the stratified masses
are usually found most deranged and
confused in their position.-
[deletion]Sections[/deletion]
Sketches of the sections of the strata will
perhaps illustrate the History and a single
glance of the eye will be more convincing
than the most minute description -
[underline]Instances[/underline]
It was in examining this curious
phaenomena that Whitehurst was led
to form the conclusion of the [underline]connection[/underline] of
the disorder of the strata with the
presence of [underline]the toadstone[/underline] and finding
that this rock was lower than the others
and that no metalic veins existed in it
and that even the veins of the limestone

[page]18||dnp16d16pp|94869503[/page]
when intersected by it appeared on the
opposite [underline]sides[/underline] -
He concluded that the strata were of
prior formation and that this [underline]substance[/underline]
had been interfused amongst them in
a liquid state by some great convulsion
of Nature. which had produced [deletion]chasms[/deletion]
chasms capable of receiving it and
which had broken and dislodged the
Sandstone, [underline]Slate and Limestone[/underline].
The toadstone of Derbyshire and the
lava of Vesuvius and Etna are very
similar in many of their external
properties -

[page]19||dnp16d17pp|94869504[/page]
This resemblance did not escape Whitehurst
and it afforded him new ideas and new analogies
Lava is certainly formed by the action of
Heat upon rock concealed in the very
bosom of the Earth.-
And it immediately occurred to our author
that toadstone must have had a similar origin
and when He had conceived this his explana[insertion]tion[/insertion]
appeared complete: for it was easy to conceive
that the same Volcanic fire which produced
the ignited and liquid mass would be
fully adequate to the derangement of the
strata to the seperation of veins and
to the formation of caverns in the
superincumbent mass.-

[page]20||dnp16d18pp|94869505[/page]
All the facts seemed to combine all were
subservient to one [underline]demonstration[/underline].
Fully satisfied with the truth of his
early speculations with there apparent
conformity to Nature:
Whitehurst did not long suffer his imagination
to rest upon the first aspect of things
how objects of disruption arose new elucidation
of them and partial Theory gradually
led to general Hypotheses.-
Most of the stratified Rocks of Derbyshire
contain shells or the remains of marine
[underline]animals[/underline].-

[page]21||dnp16d19pp|94869506[/page]
In considering this circumstance Whitehurst
was led to form the conclusion almost
common to Scientific Men that they had
been covered by the Sea:
And he immediately connected the cause
of the [underline]deluge[/underline] with their [underline]present elevation[/underline]
supposing that they had been raised
from the bottom of the ocean by the
same fires which He conceived to
have produced their irregularities.-
During the rise of new continents
and islands assumed to have taken place
it necessarily follows that the waters
must have flowed in upon the lands already
[underline]existing.[/underline].-

[page]22||dnp16d20pp|94869507[/page]
And from so great a change in the surface
the Author conceives that an alteration in
the centre of gravity of the earth must
have occurred and that in consequence
at this period its axis may have gained
its present inclination to the plane of
its orbit.
Such appear to have been the progress
of the Mind of the philosopher of Derby
in his investigations.-
Though in his work the results are
stated in a different order. His reasonings
are evidently all deduced from [underline]particular[/underline]
facts.
But in develloping his system He

[page]23||dnp16d21pp|94869508[/page]
commences with the statement of [underline]general[/underline]
[underline]principles[/underline] and He afterwards applies
them to the [underline]phaenomena[/underline].-
It will not be essential in our present
enquiry to follow him minutely through
the mere suppositions and extended parts
of his Theory in which He reasons
concerning the creation and the original
state of the Glove, a few words will
sufficiently explain[underline] his notions[/underline].-
Guided by the Newtonian Laws of Gravitation
He ascertained that conceiving the earth
to have been created as a fluid or soft
mass it must have assumed on becoming
solid the form which at present belong

[page]24||dnp16d22pp|94869509[/page]
belongs to it that of an oblate spheroid
flattened at the poles.-
He supposes it to have been covered
with water and peopled with marine
[underline]animals[/underline] immediately after the creation
and He conjectures that islands were
gradually formed in the great ocean
in consequence of the action of waves
and currents which Islands He considers
as the abodes of the antideluvian race
of Men -
He supposes like Burnet that before
the deluge the Axis of the Earth was
perpendicular to the [deletion]P[/deletion] plane of its orbit

[page]25||dnp16d23pp|94869510[/page]
and consequently that there was no variety
of seasons and that days and [underline]nights were[/underline]
equal upon every part of the surface.-
In his work a plate is given of the
form of the [underline]primitive Islands[/underline] raised
at a gentle elevation from the sea
This design [underline]represents the Section[/underline]
These Islands the fancy of Whitehurst
has pictured as abounding with all
the richest productions of [underline]Nature[/underline] as
equally [insertion]free[/insertion] from excess of Heat or Cold
and as adapted in the best possible
manner for the enjoyment of a life
extended far beyond the present limits

[page]26||dnp16d24pp|94869511[/page]
of human existence and [underline]devoted[/underline] to
[deletion]Peace [/deletion]peace, to social & domestic
[deletion]useful [deletion]usefull[/deletion] and refined pleasures[/deletion]
Happiness & to pure & refined enjoyment.-
[deletion]and to pure and [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] delights[/deletion].-
If any new arguments were wanting to
prove the insufficency of human reason in its
attempts at remote supposition and its inability
to account minutely for the primeval state
of things they might be derived from
This conjectural history of the first period
of the Globe.
Whenever Whitehurst is directed by the
arrangement of facts his ideas are always
accurate and philosophical but when He
enters the field of wild speculation his
opinions are almost as visionary as those
of the Elder Theorists

[page]27||dnp16d25pp|94869512[/page]
His account of the strata of Derbyshire
offers an admirable specimen of acute observation
and plausible induction.
It is on of the earliest and one of the most
perfect of true Geological sketches - On the
contrary, his Theories of primitive Islands
and of the perpendicularity of the axis
of the Earth are mere ingenious dreams.
He endeavours indeed to show their conformi[insertion]ty[/insertion]
to reason, and to sacred History [underline]but without[/underline]
[underline]success[/underline].
[deletion]And even allowing his conjectures[/deletion] if
[deletion]the land had been distributed wholly[/deletion]
[deletion]in Islands over the ocean and if there[/deletion]
[deletion]were no changes of seasons there is reason[/deletion]
[deletion]to believe that the general temperature[/deletion]

[page]28||dnp16d26pp|94869513[/page]
[deletion]of the Globe would be lower than it[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]is at the present time[/underline][/deletion]
For the oblique rays of the Sun in
the period of twelve hours could scarcely
possess any effect upon the poles;
ice in consequence would probably
be continually accumulating there would
be no extensive winds which are produced
only by [insertion]the[/insertion] ascent of columns of Air from
heated tracts of [underline]Land[/underline] of considerable
extent; and which are necessary for
blending the parts of the Atmosphere
together and for equalizating their
temperature.-

[page]29||dnp16d27pp|94869514[/page]
The lower strata of the air would
in consequence soon become impure
and unfit for the purposes of life -
And on these ideas allowing the
Hypotheses the Antediluvians instead of
being gently warmed by a perpetual
summer would have been chilled by
the frosts of an eternal winter -
Instead of breathing a purer and
more etherial fluid they would have
been exposed to an atmosphere filled
with noxious and suffocating vapours.

[page]30||dnp16d28pp|94869515[/page]
Animated Nature would have fallen rapidly
into decay; and there would have been
the established principle of reproduction
[deletion]similar to that which exists in the[/deletion]
[deletion]present intelligent and harmonious order[/deletion]

|_The system of M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc as it first
made its appearance 1779 embraces a [deletion]smaler[/deletion] [insertion]smaller[/insertion]
number of objects than that of Whitehurst
but his discussions are more minute and
his observations more general and extensive
Whitehurst examined with attention
the facts that were presented to him:
but his sphere of observation was
unfortunately limited to a particular
district and He was unacquainted

[page]31||dnp16d29pp|94869516[/page]
with the greatest and most important
of the [underline]mountain chains [/underline]belonging to
the Globe.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc a native of switzerland
from his infancy had been accustomed
to the contemplation of the [deletion]magnificent[/deletion] [insertion]grandest[/insertion]
& most elevated of the Mountain chains.

of Europe -
He studied these great and interesting
masses with attention and was enabled to
compare the Geological phaenomena presented
by them with similar phaenomena in
Germany France [underline]and England.[/underline].-
In his letters to the Queen facts are
recorded with a truly philosophical spirit
and his hypotheses are generally [underline]advanced[/underline].

[page]32||dnp16d30pp|94869517[/page]
with [underline]diffidence [/underline]and [underline]defended [/underline]with moderation
and candour.-
[underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc[/underline] commences his enquiries
concerning Theory at the Mosaic account
of the Creation He assumes a certain
arrangement of things which He calls
primordial and which He considers as
resulting from the immediate will of
the Almighty -
He supposes that the surface of the
Globe at its first formation contained
a number [deletion]and[/deletion] of irregular and
extensive caverns which were equally
extended beneath the bed of the

[page]33||dnp16d31pp|94869518[/page]
Ocean and below the [underline]Islands and[/underline]
[underline]continents[/underline].-
He refers the deluge to the destruction
of these caverns by subterraneous fires
and he supposes that at the time
of this great convulsion of [underline]Nature[/underline]
the primeval [underline]lands[/underline] were broken down
and covered by the Ocean which rushed
into the abyss that they had overspread
and that the present Islands and
continents which before existed in the
water were inconsequence uncovered
so that the places of the land and
sea were altogether changed.-

[page]34||dnp16d32pp|94869519[/page]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc conceives that the Rocks which
contain no organic remains and which
form the bases and the summits of our
highest mountains were parts of the
primordial matter of the Globe -
The stratified Rocks containing shells
He regards as formed at the bottom
of the antediluvian ocean and the
Basaltic Rocks which so often occur
contiguous to the common stratified
Rocks He considers as produced by
marine Volcanoes.-
In his first speculations the
philosopher of Geneva made no

[page]35||dnp16d33pp|94869520[/page]
attempt to explain the minute parts
of cosmogony.
And He entered upon no discussions
concerning the composition of the Chaos
of the laws of its arrangement.
In his [underline]later writings[/underline] he appears
however to have been reduced by too
ardent a desire of Generalization
And when He considers a confused
fluid in which all things were [deletion]dissolved[/deletion]
dissolved as [underline]the first[/underline] form of our [deletion]Globe[/deletion]
Globe and [underline]light[/underline] as the principle
which seperated its parts and gave
to them regularity and order: and

[page]36||dnp16d34pp|94869521[/page]
when He regards this light as different
from [underline]the solar light[/underline] it is impossible
to follow with pleasure the wandering
of his [underline]imagination[/underline] it is impossible
not to express a wish, that He
[underline]had rather[/underline] confined his active and
[underline]powerful Genius[/underline] to observations and
to reasonings upon probabilities
than have suffered it to waste its
strength in vain attempts to penetrate
into mystries which have been wisely
concealed from Man and the Knowledge
of which even if it could be obtained
would be comparatively useless.-

|_The system of the Earth of Wallerius
agrees in many of its points with
that of [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc[/underline] it is less valuable
as containing more Hypotheses and
less of observation:
The learned swedish professor who
followed the steps of the celebrated
Linnaeus in attempting to produce an
accurate [deletion]class[/deletion] classification of minerals
has not been very successful in his
efforts to apply a sound understanding
fitted for the arrangement of facts to
conjecture and analogical conclusions

[page]38||dnp16d36pp|94869523[/page]
He founds an important part of
this Theory upon the same basis as
Whitehurst that [underline]perpendicularity[/underline] of the
axis [underline]of the Earth[/underline] to the plane of
[underline]its orbit before the deluge[/underline]; and
He conceives that the inclination
of the axis was the first cause of
the inundation of the waters which
broke down and destroyed the [underline]land[/underline]
He reasons much more upon the
[underline]primordial[/underline] state of things than upon
their [underline]present arrangement[/underline]and his
ideas concerning the first forms of
Matter are very little connected with

[page]39||dnp16d37pp|94869524[/page]
established phaenomena.-
A very interesting account of this
Theory may be found in M[superscript]r[/superscript] Howards
Letters on the scriptural History of
the Globe: a work which excepting
the hypothetical parts is filled with
much useful and curious information
and which contains some beautiful
views of the alterations of the
Globe at present taking place -

|_A short time after the system of
Wallerius had been [underline]brought forward[/underline]
The Theory of the Earth of D[superscript]r [/superscript] Hutton
made its first appearance [deletion])[/deletion]

[page]40||dnp16d38pp|94869525[/page]
And this period may be almost considered
as forming an era in the History of
Geology.
Few works have ever excited more
attention few works have been more warmly
admired or more vehemently [underline]attacked[/underline]
and it has at least answered the
important [deletion]of[/deletion] end of keeping the
public interest alive to the facts
and discoveries of the Science.-
Many of the Elements of it may be
found in the writings of preceding
Authors in those of Hooke of Buffon
and particularly of [underline]Lazaro More[/underline] who

[page]41||dnp16d39pp|94869526[/page]
supposed all Mountains to have been
formed by Volcanic [deletion]mountains[/deletion] eruptions
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton however in cases when He
has borrowed materials has given to
them a new and more philosophical
arrangement: and He has combined
them in such a manner with the
result of his own observations and
his own reflections as to form a whole
in which all the parts are well
adapted [underline]to each other[/underline] and though it
is easy to doubt of the truth of the
system it is scarcely possible not to

[page]42||dnp16d40pp|94869527[/page]
admire the order and ingenuity with
which it is contrived.-
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton reasoning like Buffon
conceives that the agency of the
atmosphere and of water must
occasion the mountains of the Earth
constantly to diminish and He
supposes that a time must arrive in
the lapse of ages when all the
solid land which constitutes our
present continents and Islands must
be wholly destroyed by the agency
of Rivers and carried into the depths
of [underline]the ocean[/underline] -

[page]43||dnp16d41pp|94869528[/page]
From such a cause He shews that the
order of Nature must be wholly destroyed
if there did not exist another cause Capable
of renovating the land and of opposing
the agency of [underline]water[/underline] -
This cause He considers [underline]as fire[/underline] acting
under the pressure of the sea and
He attempts to prove that in the cycle
of events the solid Earth that we
at present [underline]inhabit[/underline] had been formed by
fusion at the bottom of a former Ocean
and raised from it by igneous explosion
[underline]Instance[/underline]
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton attempts to support his system by
numerous appeals to observation & to experience

[page]44||dnp16d42pp|94869529[/page]
He quotes a variety of [underline]instances[/underline] in
which rocks have been observed to
diminish in which the beds of rivers
have become deeper and in which
the ocean has gained upon [underline]the land[/underline]
He details the history of the elevation
of various Islands in the midst of
the ocean by [underline]submarine volcanoes[/underline]
And assuming the production of
[underline]Basalt by fire,[/underline]
He attempts to shew that there
exists a strong analogy between this

[page]45||dnp16d43pp|94869530[/page]
substance [underline]and Granite[/underline] and that the
mixture [underline]of Basalt with[/underline] the Rocks
containing organic remains bears a
strong analogy to the intersection of
the [underline]primordial[/underline] or primitive Rocks
by [underline]veins[/underline] of Granite.-
|_The two Theories that have been
most opposed to that of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton have
been the invention of Professor [underline]Werner[/underline]
and M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan
In the Geognosy of Werner water is
made the great agent both of decompositi[insertion]on[/insertion]
and [underline]of formation[/underline].-

[page]46||dnp16d44pp|94869531[/page]
Werner conceives that in the beginning
of things all the existing substances
composing the Globe were in a state
of solution by the aqueous fluid.
And He assumes that in consequence
of the law of chemical attraction
and in consequence of the polarity
of the particles; they assumed the
forms that at present belong to them
The Rocks that are called primord[insertion]ial[/insertion]
[underline]or primitive[/underline] and that contain no
organic remains He supposes the first
to have been deposited from the

[page]47||dnp16d45pp|94869532[/page]
[underline]original[/underline] aqueous solution, and he
considers them as the result of
[underline]chrystalization[/underline] and of an arrangement
of Matter in which all attractive
powers were duly opposed to each other.
After [underline]the first[/underline] production of [underline]Rocks[/underline] from the
dissolving [underline]fluid[/underline] He supposes counterballancing
[deletion]opposites[/deletion] [insertion]affinities[/insertion] in consequence of which certain substances
before dissolved were [underline]thrown down[/underline] not in the
chrystalized form but rather in a state of
Mechanical division and from their mixture
with the substances of primitive [underline]formation[/underline]
He supposes a new class of Rocks which He
calls the transitional Rocks to have been formed.

[page]48||dnp16d46pp|94869533[/page]
At the period of the deposition of the
transitional Rocks Werner supposes the
Ocean to have been peopled with living
beings and hence He accounts for the shells
and remains of Marine Animals existing
in them.
The last epoch in his Geology is the
production of the secondary or highly stratified
Masses containing [underline]in almost all their parts[/underline]
[underline]organic remains[/underline] and these He conjectures
to have been produced wholly by the
[underline]Mechanical[/underline] precipitation of the lowest
solid materials which had been suspended
[underline]in the ocean[/underline] and which the former

[page]49||dnp16d47pp|94869534[/page]
depositions had rendered free so as to make

[underline]with the decomposing materials of the animated[/underline]
[underline]beings belonging to the Sea[/underline]
Werner perhaps more than any other
man has had opportunities of observing the
facts of Geology belonging to a particular
district in their most minute and [underline]abstruse[/underline]
[underline]relations[/underline] from his situation as professor
of Mineralogy in the School of Mines at
Friburg the greatest perhaps ever established
He has been enabled to inspect the
most important of the forms in which
the varieties of subterraneous bodies are

[page]50||dnp16d48pp|94869535[/page]
presented to us.-
And yet in theory He has contented
himself with stating what He [insertion]himself[/insertion] even considers
as a mere History of guesses.
He has allowed insurmountable difficulties
in the way of a perfect arrangement and
his cosmogony seems [deletion]rather[/deletion] designed to
satisfy the ardent imagination [underline]of students[/underline]
in Geology and to awaken the [underline]attention[/underline]
of Scholars [insertion]rather[/insertion] than to communicate any
accurate views of Nature or [underline]to satisfy[/underline]
the wishes or desires of the [underline]true Philosopher[/underline]
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan in his Geological essays
has in many cases followed principles
of reasoning similar [underline]to those adopted by[/underline]

[page]51||dnp16d49pp|94869536[/page]
[underline]Werner[/underline]
like the philosopher of Frigburg He has
supposed an universal aqueous solution
of the solid materials of the Globe and
he has accounted for their deposition in
a similar manner:
But He has in all cases endeavoured
to adapt his own particular Theories to
the sacred History of the creation and in
consequence [deletion]and[/deletion] has often exposed himself
to the imputation of [underline]erroneous [/underline]interpretati[insertion]on[/insertion]
Thus when He considers the sublime
passage "God said let their be light and
there was light" as merely expressing
the bursting forth of Volcanic fires

[page]52||dnp16d50pp|94869537[/page]
in the arranging chaotic mass it is
impossible not to suppose him mistaken
And when He conjectures the sentence
which states the the "Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters
merely [deletion]signify[/deletion] to imply that a great
evaporation took place from [underline]the Sea[/underline]
There is no sound reasoner who will
not beleive the meaning [underline]to be forced[/underline]
[underline]and unsatisfactory[/underline].-
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan has done much for Science
As a Chemist his labours are always
valuable, as a recorder of facts his
statements are [underline]estimable[/underline].-

[page]53||dnp16d51pp|94869538[/page]
In censuring his Geological opinions
I censure only what may be considered
as the lighter ebullitions of his fancy
His productions on general philosophy
are often deep and refined and always
interesting and instructive His reputation
has been [underline]well and fully[/underline] merited.
And that he may long continue to enjoy
that reputation must be the wish of
every disinterested friend of true [underline]philosophy[/underline]
|_Controversies between the Theorist who
considered the present state of the Globe
as resulting from the agency of fire;
and those who regard it as the effect
of the power of water, have been carried

[page]54||dnp16d52pp|94869539[/page]
on with great [underline]ardor[/underline].
And the [underline]two systems [/underline][deletion]from[/deletion] have
been named in opposition to each
other, the [underline]plutonic[/underline] and the [underline]neptunian[/underline]
[underline]systems[/underline] from [underline]pluto[/underline] [insertion]the god of subterranean fire [/insertion]and [underline]neptune[/underline]
[deletion]The one supposed by the Greeks[/deletion]
[deletion]to be the titulary God of the subterranean[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]fires[/underline] and the other the deity of the[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]ocean[/underline] and of water[/deletion]
The[deletion]Hypotheses[/deletion][insertion]Theory[/insertion] of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Hutton like that
of Werner and of Kirwan has been principally
founded upon [underline]conjectures [/underline]-
For as yet there have been no
positive proofs that the principal materials
of our Globe are either soluble in water

[page]55||dnp16d53pp|94869540[/page]
or capable of [underline]being fused by fire and[/underline]
deposited in regular forms in consequence
of cooling.-
The masterly experiments of Sir James
Hall have indeed [underline]shewn[/underline] that Basalt
rendered fluid in our furnaces may be
chrystalized by a slow diminution of
[underline]temperature[/underline] and that Limestone may be
[deletion]rendered fluid[/deletion] [insertion]fused [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] under great pressure
without loosing any of the [deletion]fixed air[/deletion]
[deletion]or Carbonic acid[/deletion] [insertion]elastic fluid[/insertion] with which it is combined
But no strong analogies can be applied
from these most interesting facts, to [underline]Granite[/underline]
to the regularly formed gems or to any
of the perfectly aggregated Rocks

[page]56||dnp16d54pp|94869541[/page]
containg no organic remains.-
The general theory is almost as
obscure as before, the early operations
of Nature are unknown
And the laws of the [underline]formation[/underline] of the
[underline]habitable Globe[/underline] are still [insertion]almost[/insertion] as little
understood as those of the production
of the general planetary system
of the Sun and of the fixed stars
We are informed [insertion]by[/insertion] [underline]Clemens[/underline] [insertion]Alexandinus[/insertion] that the
Egyptian Priests [deletion][underline]Alexandrinus[/underline][/deletion] made a
statue of the God Serapis in which
they blended together all the [underline]known[/underline]
[underline]Metals[/underline] all the stones [underline]and all the soil[/underline]

[page]57||dnp16d55pp|94869542[/page]
commonly found in Egypt / and this statue
has been supposed to represent the
primordial state of things.
A useful lesson at least may be derived
from the [underline]narrative[/underline].-
No person uninstructed in the history
supposing the image now existing would
be able to reason from the form concernin[insertion]g[/insertion]
the materials, and no person from viewing
the materials would be able to devellope
[underline]the [deletion]means[/deletion][/underline] by which they [deletion]were designed[/deletion] [insertion]were mingled[/insertion]
or the end for which they were designed.
The powers of [underline]Man are scanty and[/underline]
[underline]definite[/underline] even the origins of certain
well known human [underline]productions[/underline] are
far beyond the power of his investigation

[page]58||dnp16d56pp|94869543[/page]
He is unable satisfactorily to explain
the erection of the pyramids of
Egypt of of the Druidical pillars of
Stonehenge.-
And yet he is sufficiently daring
to endeavour to apply his mind to
the most operations which have
been produced by divine intelligence
to attempt [underline]to explain[/underline] the changes
that have taken place beneath the
foundations of the Earth:
to examine the great laws of the
creation of the systems of the
universe and to reason concerning

[page]59||dnp16d57pp|94869544[/page]
Their origin in that infinite space
which he is wholly unable to [deletion]penetra[insertion]te[/insertion][/deletion]
penetrate or even accurately to imagine.
As I have spoken of the Theories of D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Hutton and M[superscript]r[/superscript] Werner it would be
unjust If I passed over [underline]without noticing[/underline]
the later important Geological
publication.
The elucidations of the Huttonian
Theory by Professor [underline]Playfair:[/underline].-
In this excellent work the ideas of
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton are [underline]develloped[/underline] with precision
[underline]and beauty[/underline] and an arrangement
is given to them infinitely superior
to [underline]that exhibited by the original Author[/underline].-

[page]60||dnp16d58pp|94869545[/page]
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton is obscure and perplexed
from the multitude of facts which
crowded on his mind.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Fairplay gifted with the faculty
[underline]of selection[/underline] has discriminated such
phaenomena only as are calculated to
elucidate [underline]his opinions[/underline] -
He has given [underline]to the plutonian[/underline] Theory
[underline]a new a more[/underline] philosophical and a
more fascinating form.
And whatever may be the fate of the
opinions of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton the work of
the distinguished Professor of Natural

[page]61||dnp16d59pp|94869546[/page]
[deletion]philosophy of Edinburgh considered[/deletion]
philosophy [underline]of Edinburgh[/underline] considered as
a literary production will stand the
ordeal of time and of the most rigid
[underline]criticism[/underline].-
The elegance and accuracy [underline]of his[/underline]
[underline]declamation[/underline] must be always applauded
and the precision and clearness of his
method and of his style will constantly
be subjects of admiration.-
In the investigation of Geology as
in almost all other enquiries to which
the human mind has been ardently
devoted very few speculations have
indeed been formed not possessed of some

[page]62||dnp16d60pp|94869547[/page]
immediate or remote applications to
the real progress of Science.-
The understanding is permanently
guided by experience:
And Brilliant delusions even though
consecrated by the efforts of genius
cannot very long continue to deceive the
public.
Useful truths are often ascertained in
the attempts made to detect imposing
errors:
And the appeal to experiment which
is the last and the only certain test
of the merits of opinion can hardly
fail to lead to discovery.-

[page]63||dnp16d61pp|94869548[/page]
Hypothesis uniformly produces [underline]discussion[/underline]
and the more ingenious and the
more active the talents by which it
was formed the greater is the probabil[insertion]ity[/insertion]
of a minute and serious examination
of facts.-
To explain Nature and the laws
instituted by the Author of Nature
and to apply the phaenomena presented
in the external World to [underline]useful[/underline]
[underline]purposes[/underline] are the great ends of
physical investigation and these ends
can only be obtained by the exertion
of all the faculties of the mind.

[page]64||dnp16d62pp|94869549[/page]
And the imagination the memory
and the reason are perhaps equally
essential to the devellopement of
great and important truths.
