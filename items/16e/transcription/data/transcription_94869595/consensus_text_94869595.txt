[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] cannot even by the Wernerians
[insertion]with any plausibility[/insertion] be called a, [underline]secondary Rock?[/underline]
|_- With regard to D[superscript]r[/superscript] Huttons
opinion;- It is true; but where
[underline]single & extensive insulated[/underline] veins
[underline]occur in large rocks[/underline]; the
look must be considered as [deletion]if[/deletion]
primary in its formation when
[underline]compared with the Vein[/underline]; |_but
in a case where two rocks
composed of very similar materials
merely blend by [underline]ramifications[/underline],
it is not necessary to suppose
them of different periods of
[underline]formation[/underline];- for there are
many causes of [underline]chrystalization[/underline];
