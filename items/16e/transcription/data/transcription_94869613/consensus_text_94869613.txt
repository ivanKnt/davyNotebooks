Rocks not only differ from
[underline]each other[/underline] in their general
[underline]properties[/underline]; but likewise in the
[underline]chemical attractions[/underline] [deletion]with[/deletion] by
which they are united [deletion]together[/deletion]:-
[deletion]Thus alumine &silex attract[/deletion]
& [underline]hence indication of the[/underline]
[deletion]Aluminal[/deletion] compositions of stones
may in most cases be gained
from their external properties.-
- Thus the [insertion]chrystalized[/insertion] stones that [insertion]principally[/insertion] contain
alumine & silex substances that
have a very strong affinity
[underline]for each other[/underline] are alway
very hard & difficult to
be broken & the greater
their hardness, the greater
the [underline]proportion[/underline] of alumine
[underline]that may be expected in them[/underline]
