Almost all the later Hypotheses
in Cosmogony, [deletion]which have been[/deletion]
noticed in the former lectures
have in some manner led to
the acquisition of facts [deletion]th[/deletion] to
the observation of Nature.-
The defenders of then have
sought for phaenomena [deletion]capable[/deletion]
[deletion]of being made[/deletion] subservient to their own
[insertion]particular[/insertion] views. |_The opposers of them
have endeavored to discover
appearance, [deletion]in [unclear]xxxxxxxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
incapable of being reconciled to
the Theory [insertion][deletion][unclear]speculatio[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion]; The real Knowledge
of the [underline]Earth[/underline] has [deletion]consequently[/deletion]

[page]8||dnp16e06pp|94869555[/page]
been extended by the efforts of
[underline]both[/underline]; & practical information has
thus arisen from [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] speculative
research.
- The [underline]objects[/underline] connected with the
devellopement of a [underline]perfect chemical[/underline]

[deletion]be numbered[/deletion] [insertion]innumerable[/insertion];- Time, & varied labour
& the application of great ingenuity
will be necessary for [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] a general [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]elucidation[/insertion] of causes:
[deletion]that[/deletion] The foundations of [underline]the Science[/underline]
[insertion]however[/insertion] are [deletion]nevertheless[/deletion] laid - |_And the
[underline]first principles[/underline] of Geology [insertion]are sufficiently distinct & intelligible.)[/insertion] (Those
[deletion][unclear]Histories[/unclear][/deletion] principles which relate to [deletion]the History[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]description[/underline] of[/deletion] the properties & nature
of the great masses which compose
the known part of the Surface

[page]9||dnp16e07pp|94869556[/page]
[deletion]& of[/deletion] the powers by which they are modified
& the order in which they are
[deletion]altered are sufficiently distinct &[/deletion]
[insertion]maintained[/insertion][deletion] intelligible to be explained according[/deletion]
[deletion]to Philosophical Views[/deletion]
- When the general exterior of the
Earth is considered, the appearances [deletion]that[/deletion]
[deletion]present themselves[/deletion] are numerous &
diversified. Hills & Vales [deletion]appear[/deletion] are
seen green with Vegetation. Mountains
hiding their summits in the clouds,
& and the light blue expanse of [deletion]the[/deletion] Water
contrasted with the dark tints of
land; The View is warm with
beauty & [underline]animation[/underline].-
On penetrating beneath the
surface however [underline]a new[/underline] & altogether
a different order of things is
presented to our attention.- All

[page]10||dnp16e08pp|94869557[/page]
is dark & silent - Soils, Earthy
Strata & rocks occur blended
together without regularity of
form - [underline][deletion]Metallic[/deletion] Veins[/underline] [deletion][unclear]& chrystallized[/unclear][/deletion]
of Metallic ores, & of chrystalized
stones intersect them in different
directions; & by superficial
[underline]examination[/underline] deformity & disorder
only are perceptible in the
subterranean mineral [underline]Kingdom[/underline].-
- |_This effect of confusion however
is but transient when the
[underline]investigating Mind[/underline],- For by Scientific
methods of comparison a distinct
[underline]arrangement is perceived[/underline] even in
[deletion]of[/deletion] those rudest of [insertion]the[/insertion] forms of
matter - An analogy between

[page]11||dnp16e09pp|94869558[/page]
their parts is ascertained; & their utility
& importance in the existing series of
Natural events appear [insertion]great &[/insertion] obvious [deletion]&[/deletion]
[deletion]considerable[/deletion].
I mentioned in a former
lecture that there is a great resemblance
in the Mineral production of extensive districts
from each other.-  Similar Soils &
Earths are usually discovered incumbent
upon similar stoney strata: & the
various Rocks that occur together
in one position are likewise generally
found together in other positions.-
- Thus the higher mountains of
France & of Spain are similar in
their Nature to those of Britain -
Most of the Specimens brought from
America [deletion]are similar in their[/deletion][insertion]present[/insertion] appearances
[deletion]to[/deletion] of the same kind as those found
in Europe.- And all the Rocks

[page]12||dnp16e10pp|94869559[/page]
& stones that have been [insertion]as yet[/insertion] procured
from [underline]New Holland[/underline] [underline]a Country[/underline ]containing
so many novelties in Botany &
Zoology have not [deletion]be[/deletion] any of the
characters of new [deletion][underline][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/underline][/deletion] mineralogical
[underline]species[/underline] & [deletion]are[/deletion] precisely [deletion]similar[/deletion] resemble
[deletion]to[/deletion] those of the old Continent.-
|_It is on this Circumstance 
principally; [deletion]on which[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] our methods
of [underline]classing Substances[/underline] according to
their geological Relations are founded.
It is this circumstance which
gives a simplicity & [underline]an Unity[/underline]
to the arrangements of the Science
& [deletion]enables[/deletion] which enables us to
judge of the position & nature
of great masses from the examination
of a few of their [insertion]minuter[/insertion] parts;

[page]13||dnp16e11pp|94869560[/page]
The distinctions between the primitive
& the secondary Rocks; have been
already often noticed: |_& [insertion]an attention to[/insertion] the
difference of their [deletion]characters[/deletion] [insertion]nature[/insertion] is
of the highest importance in
every part of the study of
Geology.-
All substances that contain
[underline]organic remains[/underline] that [insertion]bear evidence of[/insertion] having been
produced since the [deletion]Globe has[/deletion] existence
[deletion]been peopled with[/deletion] of living beings on
[insertion]the Globe[/insertion] are excluded from the [deletion]class[/deletion] [insertion]series[/insertion] of
[underline]primitive[/underline] masses.- As are likewise
all Strata [deletion]altered[/deletion] fused by Volcanoes, or
deposited from [deletion]the[/deletion] alluvions by
the [underline]late agency of water[/underline].-
- |_The [underline]primitive Rocks[/underline] are 

[page]14||dnp16e12pp|94869561[/page]
the [underline]substances[/underline] which occupy the
lowest part of the Surface of
the Earth penetrated by Human
[underline]labour[/underline]; |_& they [deletion]form[/deletion] [deletion][insertion]occupy[/insertion][/deletion] form the summits
of [deletion][insertion]every[/insertion][/deletion] the [insertion]of [underline]most[/underline] of the[/insertion] [underline]highest eminences[/underline] [deletion]belonging[/deletion]

[deletion][unclear]chains[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]Countries[/underline].-
[deletion]Amongst[/deletion] The great Masses
of [underline]primitive Rocks[/underline], [deletion]there[/deletion] are of
[underline]several species[/underline] which have
character peculiar to themselves
& [insertion]wholly[/insertion] different from those of all
other [underline]substances[/underline].
- [deletion]One of the most common[/deletion]
[deletion]of these species is [underline]Granite[/underline],- the[/deletion]
[deletion]name is derived from a latin[/deletion]
[deletion]word signifying granulated, & when[/deletion]

[page]15||dnp16e13pp|94869562[/page]
These characters it will be necessary for
us particularly to attend to.
They may be considered [insertion]geologically[/insertion] as
[underline]of two kinds[/underline].-
[underline]The first[/underline] [deletion]of[/deletion] are the external
characters of [underline]particular specimens[/underline]
considered as to appearance
weight & hardness -
- The second are the characters
of the Rocks considered as
masses in the natural
[underline]connection consisting[/underline] of general
[underline]form[/underline], of fracture & of [underline]aspect[/underline].-
- |_The characters gained
from minute inspection of

[page]16||dnp16e14pp|94869563[/page]
Single specimens are the
[underline]most accurate[/underline];- But the
general [deletion]aspect & appearances[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]outine[/unclear] & shades of[/insertion]
of Rocks though not uniformly
to be trusted to offer very
useful [underline]indications[/underline].-
- I [underline]shall endeavour[/underline] to
illustrate the first class
of characters by [deletion]of[/deletion] the
[underline]exhibition of [deletion]specimens[/deletion] [insertion]pieces of Rocks[/insertion][/underline].-
And [deletion]the[/deletion] & the second by
[underline]means[/underline] of colored [underline]sketches[/underline].-
|_ - These illustrations will
I fear be the most tedious
part of [underline]the Course[/underline]; for

[page]17||dnp16e15pp|94869564[/page]
accurate knowledge can only
be gained by minute inspection.-
& in a Room so large as
this it is impossible that
all the appearances can
be [underline]distinctly observed[/underline] [deletion]by[/deletion]
the [deletion]audience[/deletion]
I shall however use every
effort to describe the
[underline]properties[/underline] in such a manner
that they may be easily
[deletion]remembered[/deletion] remembered & by
those who are desirous
of acquiring practical information
the specimens may be afterwards
[underline]examined[/underline][underline][insertion]accurately &[/insertion] in  detail.-

[page]18||dnp16e16pp|94869565[/page]
One of the more common
species of the primitive
Rocks is granite -

|_[underline]The [insertion]difference of the[/insertion] colours of Granite[/underline] are principally

[underline]The Lower[/underline] Rocks very much

order & formed by a much later
[deletion]the Neptunians they are called[/deletion]
infiltration of Water -
[deletion][underline]secondary Granite[/underline]:-[/deletion]
- To the Huttonians they
offer a strong argument
in favour of the formation

- The Rock in which a vein
is found [insertion]says D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/insertion] must have been
prior in existence to the Vein
itself - [underline]Therefore the[/underline] Granite
must [underline]have been[/underline] formed after

|_Neither the reasonings adopted

which they [underline]are connected[/underline]; & this

[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] cannot even by the Wernerians
[insertion]with any plausibility[/insertion] be called a, [underline]secondary Rock?[/underline]
|_- With regard to D[superscript]r[/superscript] Huttons
opinion;- It is true; but where
[underline]single & extensive insulated[/underline] veins
[underline]occur in large rocks[/underline]; the
look must be considered as [deletion]if[/deletion]
primary in its formation when

in a case where two rocks

it is not necessary to suppose

[deletion]there is little favourable to[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx them indeed at least[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]in [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
- On the [deletion]general [/deletion]extensive ground
of opinion I confess; that the general

[page]50||dnp16e48pp|94869597[/page]
[insertion]primitive Rocks[/insertion] offer very few [deletion]fac[/deletion] facts favourable
to [underline]either Hypothesis[/underline] -  For
as I have [underline]already said[/underline] -

fusible by fire nor soluble
in Water -  [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] As  yet

Quartz has been[deletion]fused[/deletion][insertion]rendered fluid [/insertion] by

- There is indeed another
strong argument against the
[underline]primitive Rocks[/underline] having been
formed by the fire from the
Remains of former continents
& [underline]islands[/underline].  |_Coal or Carbonaceous
Matter is one of the substances
[underline]very abundant [/underline] upon the [deletion][/deletion]

the [insertion]Neptunian[/insertion] Geognosy [insertion]or that[/insertion] of Werner &

- [deletion]Though[/deletion] In the present state
of our Knowledge we are wholly

the agencies to which their

[page]62||dnp16e60pp|94869609[/page]
general uses in the Oeconomy of
[underline]Nature[/underline].-
-The[deletion]ir[/deletion] appearance [insertion]of primitive Rocks[/insertion] are almost
infinitely diversified; & get their
[deletion]cir[/deletion] constituent parts are comparatively

- By the refined methods of
Chemistry [deletion]they hardest[/deletion] even the
hardest stones are capable of
[underline]being brought into solution[/underline], &
their elements separated from

- This fluid contains the
[unclear]matter[/unclear] of Quartz Rock
dissolved in an [underline]alkaline lixivium[/underline]
And by means of an acid
the [deletion]matter of the Rock[/deletion][insertion]earth that it contains[/insertion]
may be separated in a finely

[page]63||dnp16e61pp|94869610[/page]
[underline]divided state[/underline] -
By other analogous Methods

And by such experimental processes
[underline]it is demonstrated that[/underline] all most
the varieties of the primitive
Rocks that have been described
[underline]consist [/underline][deletion]most[/deletion] [insertion]chiefly[/insertion] of different
[underline]combinations[/underline] of four [insertion]elementary[[/insertion]deletion]primitive[/deletion]
[unclear]earhts[/unclear] called Silex, Alumine,
[underline]Zinc & Magnesia[/underline] & a small

[page]64||dnp16e62pp|94869611[/page]
quantity of iron combined with oxygene
[underline]in pure Air:-[/underline]
Alumine in its pure
& chrystalized form exists in
the sapphire - Silicious
earth in Rock crystal.-
And [insertion]caustic[/insertion] [underline]Magnesia[/underline] & Lime as
they are usually offered to our
attention are the [deletion]primitive[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]undecompounded[/unclear][/insertion]
[underline]substances[/underline] [deletion]called by[/deletion] known
by chemists under these
denominations.
- In feld spar; the Silicious
earth is [underline]combined[/underline] with small
quantities of the other primitive
earths & when colored it
usually owes its tint to the
[underline]combined oxide of iron[/underline]:-

[page]65||dnp16e63pp|94869612[/page]
- Mica [insertion]principally[/insertion] contains silicious
Earth & aluminous earth with
a little magnesia & oxide of
iron in its [underline]coloring matter[/underline] -
- In [underline]Hornblende & Shoerl[/underline]
the quantity of [underline]Iron is greater[/underline]
- In serpantine there is a
considerable proportion of
[underline]Magnesia[/underline] united to the other
earths -
- But [insertion]white[/insertion] Limestone consists
of [underline]pure Lime[/underline] united to
an elastic fluid called Carbonic
acid or fixed air whence
its effervescence when acted on
by an acid; & the colored Limestones
[underline]owe[/underline] their tints to oxide of Iron.
[deletion][underline]The[/underline][/deletion]
- The [underline]elementary earths[/underline]
that form the constituent parts of

[page]66||dnp16e64pp|94869613[/page]
Rocks not only differ from
[underline]each other[/underline] in their general
[underline]properties[/underline]; but likewise in the
[underline]chemical attractions[/underline] [deletion]with[/deletion] by
which they are united [deletion]together[/deletion]:-
[deletion]Thus alumine &silex attract[/deletion]
& [underline]hence indication of the[/underline]
[deletion]Aluminal[/deletion] compositions of stones
may in most cases be gained
from their external properties.-
- Thus the [insertion]chrystalized[/insertion] stones that [insertion]principally[/insertion] contain
alumine & silex substances that
have a very strong affinity
[underline]for each other[/underline] are alway
very hard & difficult to
be broken & the greater
their hardness, the greater
the [underline]proportion[/underline] of alumine
[underline]that may be expected in them[/underline]

[page]67||dnp16e65pp|94869614[/page]
- The stones that contain Magnesia
[insertion]with alumine & Silex[/insertion] on the contrary [underline]are [insertion]equally[/insertion] soft[/underline]
And Magnesia has no attraction
for [underline]Silex[/underline] & only a slight
one [underline]for alumine[/underline].-
And [underline]Limestone[/underline] which is the softest
of all the primitive Rocks
contains Lime united by a
weak power of combination
to an elastic fluid.-

concerning their essence, is as yet

minute facts concerning their
origin.-
- The primitive Rocks & mountains

[underline]described[/underline], [underline]often occur[/underline] in [deletion]extensive[/deletion]
[underline]chains[/underline] which extend for
many hundred Miles: |_&
their Geographical position is
of considerable importance
in [underline]the general [/underline]order
of Natural events.-
- The Heat of the [deletion]Atmosphere[/deletion][insertion]Air[/insertion]
is derived from the agency of
the rays of the Sun upon the

[page]70||dnp16e68pp|94869617[/page]
surface of the earth & it
diminishes in proportion to
the height, so [underline]that[/underline] the
[deletion]strata of elastic fluid[/deletion]
[underline]Atmosphere[/underline] at three or
four miles high is intensely
[underline]cold[/underline] - Hence the temperature
of [underline]mountains[/underline] is always much
lower than heat of
[underline]Plains;[/underline] [deletion]And Hence they[/deletion]
[deletion]precipitate the moisture contained[/deletion]
[deletion]in the warmer currents[/deletion]
[deletion]of Air that happen to[/deletion]
[deletion]be wafted by the winds[/deletion]
[deletion]against their sides -[/deletion] 
[deletion]This is one of the principal[/deletion]
[deletion]Sources of the streams that[/deletion]

[underline]Summer[/underline] currents of cold
Air [deletion]can[/deletion] are continually flowing

they influence the course [insertion][deletion] of currents of Air[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]of the[/dletion]

the principal - [underline]mountains[/underline] occur
in the North & North East
part[underline]of the island[/underline]: |_& our

-[underline]North America[/underline] as is well

[page]74||dnp16e72pp|94869621[/page]
is much colder in Winter &
hotter in Summer than the
parts of Europe under the
same parallels of[underline]latitude[/underline],
|_And this seems in great
measure to be owing to
the inferiority of the mountains
