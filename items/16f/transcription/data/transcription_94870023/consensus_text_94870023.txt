These illustrations will I fear be the most
tedious [underline]of the course[/underline] for accurate
Knowledge can only be gained by minute
inspection and in a Room so large as this
it is impossible that all the appearances
can be [underline]distinctly observed[/underline].-
I shall however use every effort to describe
the properties in such a manner that
they may be easily remembered and by
those who are desirous of acquiring
practical [deletion]knowledge[/deletion] information the
specimens may be afterwards examined
accurately [underline]and in detail[/underline].-
