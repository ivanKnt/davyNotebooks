Sienite is another of the primitive Rocks
derives its name from Syene in Egypt
when examined in small masses it appears
very similar [underline]to granite[/underline] one of its
ingredients is the same the [underline]feld spar[/underline]; but it
contains neither Quartz nor mica but
[underline]Hornblende[/underline].-
The aspect of [underline]Scientite[/underline] when presented
in great masses [underline]in Nature[/underline] [underline]is very peculiar[/underline]
It neither occurs stratified nor seperated [underline]in[/underline]
blocks but it presents a number of irregular
fractures and [underline]pointed craigs[/underline]and its colour
is generally Grey or Yellow
Both Granite and Sientite are composed
of distinct chrystals of [underline]feld spar[/underline] [underline]imbeded[/underline]
