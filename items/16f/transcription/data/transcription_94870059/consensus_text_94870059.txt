This sketch -
[deletion]The attempt has [/deletion]been made to delineate
[deletion]the aspect of serpentine in this[/deletion] group
of [deletion]Rocks N[superscript]o[/superscript]5 - Instance[/deletion]
Serpentine is one of the primitive
Rocks which contains the greatest number
of perforations and of [deletion]orifices[/deletion][insertion]caves[/insertion]
And when it occurs upon a great scale
its appearances are in the highest degree
picturesque
In the large masses of serpentine [deletion]which[/deletion]
as they exist in Nature
[deletion]form the cliffs of Cape Lizard in Cornwall[/deletion]
nothing can exceed the variety of the
colours and the smoothness and polish of
the surface Red dark green [underline]brown and [/underline]
[underline]yellow[/underline] all appear sometimes distinct &
sometimes softening into each [underline]other[/underline] -
