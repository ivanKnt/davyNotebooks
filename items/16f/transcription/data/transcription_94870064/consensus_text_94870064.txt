This Quartz mountain is of a [underline]pure white[/underline]
and when it is first considered at a
distance it appears amongst the other
mountains as if cloathed in perpetual
[underline]snows[/underline] -
The curved lines of the strata that
compose it are very beautiful and when
illuminated by the sun the white
light from it produces the highest effect
of brilliancy and splendour
It was once doubted whether any
Limestone existed free from [underline]shells[/underline] - but
the most accurate researches have lately
demonstrated that there are undoubted
primitive Rocks of this substance found
contiguous to the other primitive [underline]Rocks[/underline],
