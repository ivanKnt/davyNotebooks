but Serpentine and granular Limestone
seldom occur either incumbent upon
or alternating [underline]with granite[/underline].-
Thus in Cornwall which is most
distinctly a primitive [underline]Country[/underline]
[underline]The Granite[/underline] and micaceous and
[underline]silicious shist[/underline] meet and form the
principal Rocky basis of [underline]the land -[/underline]
The Limestone occurs only in alternation
with or upon the shist and the [underline]Serpentine[/underline]
[underline]district[/underline] is bounded on one side by
[underline]micaceous shists[/underline] and on the other side
by Sientite -
