There is a similar arrangement
in other great [underline]mountain chains[/underline] -
Thus in the highest eminence of
the alps which is represented in this
sketch - The principle Rocks are
Sienite Granite and micaceous shist -
and Granite forms the great basis
of [underline]Mont Blanc[/underline] -
A number of Geological descriptions
which demonstrate the same facts
may be found in writings of
M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc and of De Saussure but
it will be unnecessary for me to
multiply the instances as they are in
[underline]most cases analagous[/underline] -
