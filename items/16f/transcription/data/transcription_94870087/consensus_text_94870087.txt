The different primitive Rocks have very
different modes of junction and of transition
into each other.-
In some cases the parts of their union
one in [underline]right lines[/underline] a circumstance which
often occurs in the meeting of silicious
shist and Granite and porphyry -
Instance
Serpentine Sientite and [underline]micaceous shist[/underline]
sometimes pass into each other by very
[underline]gentle gradations[/underline]
And where granular Limestone is placed
upon micaceous shist near the point
of junction it uniformly contains larger
or smaller proportions [underline]of mica[/underline] -
