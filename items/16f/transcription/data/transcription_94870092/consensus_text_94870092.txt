Granite and micaceous shist sometimes have
their parts mixed at the point of junction
and in other cases they inosculate sending
forth distinct ramifications of Veins.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
This fact occurs on a considerable scale at
St Michaels Mount in [underline]Cornwall[/underline];- The great
body of the mountain is [underline]of Granite[/underline]; but at
its base a stratum of the shist [underline]occurs[/underline]:
and this layer of Granite may be traced
to a considerable extent running into the
shist. [underline]whilst. ramifications[/underline] of the shist
in many [underline]places penetrate[/underline] into the [underline]Granite[/underline]
Those in[insertion]oscu[/insertion]lations of Granite and shist
which occur abundantly in different
parts of the world have been subjects of
[deletion]great disputes[/deletion]
