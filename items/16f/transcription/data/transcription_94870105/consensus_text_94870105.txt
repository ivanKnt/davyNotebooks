strongest Heat of our furnaces assisted by
the most powerful [underline]effects of Air[/underline]:
And it is therefore scarcely possible to
believe that mountains of [underline]this stone[/underline] more 
than a mile in perpendicular height
and many miles in circumference can
have been rendered fluid by subterraneous
Heat excited without the [underline]access of Air[/underline]
and supposed to act even immediately
[underline]beneath the water of the Ocean[/underline].
There is indeed another strong argumen
[underline]against the primitive[/underline] Rocks having been
formed by fire from the remains of
former Continents and [underline]islands[/underline].
