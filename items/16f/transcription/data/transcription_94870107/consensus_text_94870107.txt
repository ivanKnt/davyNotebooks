Coal or carbonaceous matter is one of the
substances [underline]very abundant[/underline] upon the
[underline]surface[/underline] and in its pure form it is
an element incapable of [underline]being produced[/underline]
and not in the slightest degree [underline]volatile[/underline]
[underline]by Heat[/underline]
And it ought therefore (assuming the
probability of the theory of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton)
to be found in or amongst the groupes
of primitive [underline]substances[/underline], with granite
with micaceous shist and with the
serpentine and granular Limestone
but this [underline]in[/underline] fact [underline]is not the case[/underline],
And in almost all the mountain chains
scarcely any vestiges of Coaly matter occurs
