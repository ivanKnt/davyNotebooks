past [underline]and the future[/underline]
If [underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/underline] and [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Werner[/underline] had
contented themselves with explaining
[underline]those operations[/underline] by which our Globe
is constantly preserved as a habitable
World in the series of events at present
[underline]taking place[/underline], they would have deserved
a much higher praise than that of
having been the founders of ingenious
Hypotheses
But when in attempting to explain
appearances they attribute [underline]to agents[/underline]
powers which they have never been
observed to exert, or refer to effects to causes
the operation of which they are ignorant
