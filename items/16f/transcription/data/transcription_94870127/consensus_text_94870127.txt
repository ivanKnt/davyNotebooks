By other analogous methods which were
exhibited in [underline]the Autumnal course of Lectures[/underline]
[underline]on chemical analysis[/underline]; may the constituent
principles of other Rocks be separated
[underline]from each other[/underline] and obtained in a [underline]form[/underline]
[underline]of purity[/underline]
And by such experimental processes it
[underline]is demonstrated that[/underline] almost the varieties
of the primitive Rocks that have been
described consist chiefly of different [insertion][underline]combinations[/underline][/insertion]
of four elementary earths, called Silex
Alumine [underline]Lime and Magnesia[/underline] and a
small quantity of Iron combined
with oxygene [underline]or pure Air[/underline].-
