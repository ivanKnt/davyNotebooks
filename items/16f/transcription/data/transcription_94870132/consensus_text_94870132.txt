In [underline]Hornblende and Shoerl[/underline] the quantity of
[underline]iron is greater[/underline]
In serpentine there is a considerable
proportion of [underline]magnesia[/underline] united to the other
earths -
But white Limestone consists of [underline]pure Lime[/underline]
united to an elastic fluid called carbonic acid
or fixed air whence its effervescence when
acted on by an acid and the coloured
Limestone owe their tints to oxide of iron
The [underline]elementary earths[/underline] that form the
constituent parts of Rocks not only differ
from [underline]each other[/underline] in their general [underline]properties[/underline]
but likewise in their [underline]chemical attractions[/underline]
by which they are united.-
