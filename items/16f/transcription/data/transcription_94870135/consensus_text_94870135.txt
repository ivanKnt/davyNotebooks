And [underline]hence indications[/underline] of the composition
of Stone may in most cases be gained from
their external properties -
Thus the chrystalized stones that principaly
contain alumine and silex substances that
have a very strong affinity [underline]for each other[/underline]
are always very hard and difficult to
[underline]be broken[/underline]
And the greater their hardness the
greater the proportion of alumine -
The stones that contain magnesia with
alumine and silex on the contrary are
usually soft -
And magnesia has no attraction for Silex
and only a slight one for alumine -
