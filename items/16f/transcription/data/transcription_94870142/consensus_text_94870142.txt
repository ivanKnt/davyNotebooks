And their Geographical position is of
considerable importance in [underline]the general[/underline]
order of Natural events -
The Heat of the air is derived from
the agency of the rays of the Sun
upon the surface of the earth and it
diminishes in proportion to the height
so that the Atmosphere at three or
four miles high is intensely [underline]cold[/underline] -
Hence the temperature of mountains
is always much lower than that of
plains -
And in all climates of the Globe
when they are above 15 thousand feet
