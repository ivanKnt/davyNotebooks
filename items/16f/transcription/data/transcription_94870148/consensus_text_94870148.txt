high their tops are covered with perpetual
[underline]Snow[/underline] -
And the height of the point of congelation
[underline]diminishes[/underline] in a regular progression from
the equator [underline]towards the poles[/underline] so that in
our latitude it is about five thousand
feet [underline]Ben Nevis[/underline] being [underline]very little within[/underline]
the limits of constant [underline]ice[/underline] -
It is in consequence of this [underline]circumstance[/underline]
that mountain chains affect in a high
degree the temperature of the climate
in which they exist -
In the summer currents of cold air are
continually flowing down [underline]their sides[/underline]
which mitigate the burning heat of the
season
