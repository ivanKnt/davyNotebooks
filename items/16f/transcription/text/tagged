[underline][misc]misc_691|Geology Lecture 5[superscript]th[/superscript][/misc][/underline]
[misc]misc_689|Almost all the later Hypotheses is[/misc]
Cosmogony noticed in the former lectures
have in some manner led to the
acquisition of facts and to the
[underline]observation[/underline] of [underline]Nature[/underline] ._
The defenders of them have sought
for phaenomena subservient to their
own particular views.
The opposers of them have endeavoured
to discover appearances incapable
of being reconciled to the Theory

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00008|dnp16f06pp|94870004[/page]
The real knowledge of the Earth has been
extended by the effects of both and practical
information has thus arisen from speculative
research.-
The objects connected with the
devellopement of a perfect chemical
Theory of the Globe are almost innumerable
Time and varied labour and the applicati[insertion]on[/insertion]
of great ingenuity will be necessary
for a general elucidation of causes
The foundations of the science however
are laid -
And the first principles [insertion]of Geology[/insertion] are sufficiently
distinct and intelligible.

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00009|dnp16f07pp|94870007[/page]
Those principles which relate to the
[underline]properties of Nature[/underline] of the great masses
which compose the known part of the
surface the powers by which they are
modified and the order in which they
are maintained
When the general exterior of the
Earth is considered the appearances are
numerous and diversified. Hills and
Vales are seen green with vegetation.
Mountains hiding their summits in
the clouds and the light blue expanse
of water contrasted with the dark tints
of land: The view is warm with
beauty and [underline]animation[/underline].-

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00010|dnp16f08pp|94870009[/page]
On penetrating [insertion]beneath[/insertion] the surface however
a new and altogether [underline]different[/underline] order
of things is presented to our attention
All is dark and silent -
Soils Earthy strata and Rocks are
blended together without regularity of
form - Veins of metalic ores and of
chrystalized stones intersect them in
different directions and by superficial
[underline]examination[/underline] deformity and disorder
only are perceptible in the subterranean
mineral [underline]Kingdom[/underline] -

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00011|dnp16f09pp|94870011[/page]
This effect of confusion however is but
transient upon the [underline]investigating mind.[/underline]
For by Scientific methods of comparison
a distinct [underline]arrangement[/underline] is [underline]perceived[/underline]
even in those rudest [deletion]forms[/deletion] of the forms
of matter -
An analogy between their parts is
ascertained and their utility and
importance in the existing series of
Natural events appear great and
obvious.-
I mentioned in a former lecture that there
is a great resemblance in the mineral production
of extensive districts situated at distances
from each other.-

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00012|dnp16f10pp|94870013[/page]
Similar soils and earths are usually
discovered incumbent upon similar stoney
strata and the various Rocks that occur
together in one position are likewise generally
found together in other positions.-
Thus the higher mountains of France
and [insertion]of[/insertion] [place]place_164|Spain[/place] are similar in their nature
to those of [place]place_159|Britain[/place]. Most of the specimens
brought from [place]place_878|America[/place] present appearances
of the same kind as those [deletion]brought[/deletion] [insertion]found[/insertion] [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion]
Europe -
And all the Rocks and stones that have
been as yet procured from [place]place_685|[underline]New Holland[/underline][/place]
a country containing so many novelties
[deletion]in Botany and Zoology have not[/deletion]

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00013|dnp16f11pp|94870016[/page]
in Botany and Zoology have not any of
the characters of new mineralogical species
and precisely resemble those of the old
continent.-
It is on this circumstance principally that
our method of [underline]classing substances[/underline] according to
their Geological Relations are founded.
It is this circumstance which gives a
simplicity and [underline]an unity[/underline] to the arrangement
of the Science and which enables us to
judge of the position and nature
great masses from the examination of a
few of their [underline]minuter parts.-[/underline]

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00014|dnp16f12pp|94870018[/page]
The distinction between the primitive and
the secondary Rocks have been already
often noticed and an attention to the
difference of their nature is of the highest
importance in every part of the study of
Geology.-
All substances that contain organic remains
that bear evidence of having been produced
since the existence of living beings on
the Globe are excluded from the series
of [underline]primitive[/underline] masses.-
As are likewise all strata fused by
volcanoes [deletion]fires[/deletion] or deposited from by
[underline]the agency of Water[/underline].-

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00015|dnp16f13pp|94870020[/page]
[deletion]The primitive Rocks are[/deletion]
[underline]The primitive Rocks are[/underline] [underline]the substances[/underline]
which occupy the lowest part of the surface
of the Earth penetrated by human [underline]labour.[/underline]
And the form the summits of most of the
[underline]highest eminences of mountainous Countries[/underline]
The great masses of [underline]primitive Rocks[/underline] are of
[underline]several species[/underline] which have characters peculiar
to themselves and wholly different from those
of all other [underline]substances[/underline].-
These characters it will be necessary for
us particularly to attend to
They may be considered Geologically as two
Kinds.
The first are the external characters of
[underline]particular specimens[/underline] considered as to appearance
weight and hardness -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00016|dnp16f14pp|94870021[/page]
The second are the characters of the Rocks
considered as masses in the natural
[underline]connection[/underline] consisting of general [underline]form[/underline]
of fracture and of [underline]aspect[/underline].-
The characters gained from minute
inspection of single specimens are the
[underline]most accurate[/underline];-
But the general outline and shades of
Rocks though not uniformly to be trusted
to offer very  useful [underline]indications[/underline].-
I [underline]shall endeavour[/underline] to illustrate [underline]the[/underline]
[underline]first [/underline]class of characters by the exhibition
of pieces of Rocks.
And the second by means of Coloured
Sketches -

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00017|dnp16f15pp|94870023[/page]
These illustrations will I fear be the most
tedious [underline]of the course[/underline] for accurate
Knowledge can only be gained by minute
inspection and in a Room so large as this
it is impossible that all the appearances
can be [underline]distinctly observed[/underline].-
I shall however use every effort to describe
the properties in such a manner that
they may be easily remembered and by
those who are desirous of acquiring
practical [deletion]knowledge[/deletion] information the
specimens may be afterwards examined
accurately [underline]and in detail[/underline].-

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00018|dnp16f16pp|94870024[/page]
One of the most common [deletion]spesies[/deletion] species of
the primitive Rocks is [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical].
The word signifies granulated and when
[underline]superfically examined[/underline] the stone appears
as a number of small fragments [underline]cemented[/underline]
[underline]together[/underline]
It is however in fact composed of three
[underline]bodies[/underline] confusedly [underline]chrystalized together[/underline].
And they are named [underline][chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical][/underline] [underline][chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical][/underline] and
[chemical]chemical_101|[underline]Mica[/underline][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical] - feld-spar - [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical]
[underline]hardness[/underline] [underline]chrystalization[/underline] [underline]lustre[/underline]
The difference of the colours of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
are principally owing to the [underline][chemical]chemical_104|feld spar[/chemical][/underline]
[underline]and [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical][/underline]
The [chemical]chemical_104|feld spar[/chemical] is found of shades of

[deletion][deletion]Rocks[/deletion] in [deletion]the Island of [place]place_571|Mull[/place] where[/deletion] the blocks[/deletion]
[deletion]are comparatively small.-/[/deletion]
[deletion]In this picture which has been before[/deletion]
[deletion]exhibited - The lower Rocks very much inclined[/deletion] 
[deletion]to the horizon may be conceived to represent[/deletion]
[deletion]the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] in layers or [unclear]Gnesis[/unclear].[/deletion]
[deletion]All the other Rocks represent the substance[/deletion]
[deletion]in [underline]blocks[/underline] which are distinct and placed on[/deletion]
[deletion]each other. And their distinctness is[/deletion]
[deletion]exceedingly evident in the Rock [deletion]pe[/deletion] represented[/deletion]
[deletion]by this mass.[/deletion]
[deletion]It is called the [place]place_1055|Logan Rock[/place]. And it is[/deletion]
[deletion]an insulated body of nearly 40 feet in{/deletion]
[deletion]circumference and so exactly poised upon[/deletion]

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00020|dnp16f18pp|94870027[/page]
[deletion]the point of another rock that it can be[/deletion]
[deletion]easily moved to and fro by the hands[/deletion]
[deletion]Though the united efforts of 100 men would[/deletion]
[deletion]be wholly insufficient to [underline]move it[/underline] -[/deletion]
The aspect of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] is well expressed
in every part of [underline]this view[/underline] No Rock is
grander in form or more sublime in
[underline]structure[/underline] -
And placed at the last extremity of our
Land it seems well adapted from its
magnitude solidity and strength to resist
the force of the waves of the [place]place_056|Atlantic[/place]
and to prevent the encroachments of
the ocean upon the Land.-

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00021|dnp16f19pp|94870030[/page]
[chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical] is another of the primitive Rocks
derives its name from [place]place_1317|Syene[/place] in [place]place_475|Egypt[/place]
when examined in small masses it appears
very similar [underline]to [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline] one of its
ingredients is the same the [underline][chemical]chemical_104|feld spar[/chemical][/underline]; but it
contains neither [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical] nor [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical] but
[underline][chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical][/underline].-
The aspect of [underline]Scientite[/underline] when presented
in great masses [underline]in Nature[/underline] [underline]is very peculiar[/underline]
It neither occurs stratified nor seperated [underline]in[/underline]
blocks but it presents a number of irregular
fractures and [underline]pointed craigs[/underline]and its colour
is generally Grey or Yellow
Both [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] and Sientite are composed
of distinct chrystals of [underline][chemical]chemical_104|feld spar[/chemical][/underline] [underline]imbeded[/underline]

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00022|dnp16f20pp|94870042[/page]
in a mass of [unclear][chemical]chemical_407|[underline]Hornstone[/underline][/chemical][/unclear] [underline]or of [chemical]chemical_124|jasper[/chemical][/underline]
Porphyry is found of a great variety of
colours: - of the most beautiful. Kind is
[deletion]red [/deletion]the [chemical]chemical_125|Red Porphyry[/chemical] of this there is a large
pillar in the British Museum
The aspect presented by the porphyry in some
measures resembles that of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]; but
the blocks are smaller and the surface
is almost [insertion]always[/insertion] smooth.
The masses of Porphyry are rarely
large and hence insulated Rocks or cliffs
of it seldom present much Majesty of
form or variety of appearance but;

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00023|dnp16f21pp|94870048[/page]
when blended with wood and river scenery
As it is in several vallies near [place]place_995|Ben Nevis[/place]
in [place]place_235|Scotland[/place] the appearance is exceedingly
beautiful and its high tints increase
the effects of green of vegetation and
The full light of [underline]the water[/underline].-
[underline]Another primitive Rock [/underline]which occurs
almost as frequently [underline]as [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline] and
much more frequently than either
porphyry or Sientite is [underline][chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical][/underline] -
It consists [underline]principally of [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical][/underline] whence
its name but is likewise contains [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical]
In its appearance it is one of the most
splendid of Rocks.
[deletion]It occurs generally in [unclear]irregular layers[/unclear][/deletion]

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00024|dnp16f22pp|94870051[/page]
It occurs generally in irregular layers
which have the appearance of leaves
[underline]Instance[/underline]
There are two other species of primitive
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] for the name has been applied to
several stones arranged [underline]in layers[/underline] -
These are Rocks of a [underline]simple constitution[/underline]
They are both opaque and similar as
to aspect; but the one is so hard as not
to be cut [underline]with a knife[/underline] and the
other [underline]is exceedingly soft[/underline].
Instance
The hard is named primitive [underline][chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical][/underline]
[underline][chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] [/underline]and the other argillaceous [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical].
All the primitive [chemical]chemical_120|Shists[/chemical] in the exterior
of their forms present considerable

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00025|dnp16f23pp|94870054[/page]
[underline]irregularities [/underline]and their layers break in
points in consequence of which when the
Masses are large their outline is often very
[underline]bold and impressive[/underline]
Serpentine is one of the primitive
Rocks which occurs least frequently in
Nature -
It is simple in its constitution and
is one of the most singular of mineral
productions.-
It is smooth to the touch is scarcely scratched
with the knife and has a peculiar lustre
Its colors are generally [underline]mixed[/underline] and
principally red and green which are
diffused in streaks similar to those on
the skin of the serpent whence its name
It is simple in its constitution and
Diffused into streaks similar to those on

By the ancient it was called [misc]misc_685|Ophite[/misc] and 
was much used in ornamental works
pliny who has given a detailed account of
this stone attributes to it many [underline]wonderful [/underline]
[underline]virtues [/underline]-
Such as that of healing the bites of serpents
and He recomended a piece of it worn suspended
from the neck as an effectual guard against
every [underline]species of enchantment[/underline] -
|_Serpentine at a considerable distance
is easily distinguished by its aspect from
all other Rocks -
It occurs in masses which generally
approach to the square figure and often
present a number of small and
irregular chasms -

[deletion]The attempt has [/deletion]been made to delineate
[deletion]the aspect of serpentine in this[/deletion] group
of [deletion]Rocks N[superscript]o[/superscript]5 - Instance[/deletion]
Serpentine is one of the primitive
Rocks which contains the greatest number
of perforations and of [deletion]orifices[/deletion][insertion]caves[/insertion]
And when it occurs upon a great scale
its appearances are in the highest degree
picturesque
In the large masses of serpentine [deletion]which[/deletion]
as they exist in Nature
[deletion]form the cliffs of Cape Lizard in [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place][/deletion]
nothing can exceed the variety of the
colours and the smoothness and polish of
the surface Red dark green [underline]brown and [/underline]
[underline]yellow[/underline] all appear sometimes distinct &
sometimes softening into each [underline]other[/underline] -

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00028|dnp16f26pp|94870061[/page]
The white foam of the wave becomes
a cause of contrast:
And if [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] is the most sublime of
the primitive Rocks in its form Serpentine
may [deletion]be[/deletion]with propriety be said to
possess the highest character [underline]of[/underline] [underline]Beauty[/underline].
[underline][chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical] Rock[/underline] forming immense masses
occurs in some primitive [underline]districts[/underline] -
It is granular in its fracture and
sometimes mixed with [underline]small quantities[/underline]
of [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical].
In its aspect it appears in layers
or in imperfect blocks having a four
sided form.-

This [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical] mountain is of a [underline]pure white[/underline]
and when it is first considered at a
distance it appears amongst the other
mountains as if cloathed in perpetual
[underline]snows[/underline] -
The curved lines of the strata that
compose it are very beautiful and when
illuminated by the sun the white
light from it produces the highest effect
of brilliancy and splendour
It was once doubted whether any
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] existed free from [underline]shells[/underline] - but
the most accurate researches have lately
demonstrated that there are undoubted
primitive Rocks of this substance found
contiguous to the other primitive [underline]Rocks[/underline],

Primitive marble differs from common
marble not only in being free from organic
remains but likewise in [underline]its fracture[/underline]:
which is soft and grained or like that
of [underline]loaf sugar[/underline] - & it is composed of
minute chrystals of [chemical]chemical_406|Calcareous Spar[/chemical] -
- Cal: Spar -

The aspect of white [underline]primitive [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical][/underline]
is somewhat similar to that of [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical]
Rock but its [deletion]lustre[/deletion][insertion]lustre[/insertion] is less considerable

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00031|dnp16f29pp|94870069[/page]
It is almost always arranged in strata
it seldom presents a rough outline
Its forms are curved and its declivities 
gentle.-
These are the principal Rocks that
form the solid foundations of the
surface at the Earth there are many
varieties of them: and there are some
other stoney substances that occur
mixed with them; but I have thought
it necessary in this lecture to attend
only [insertion]to[/insertion] the nature of the great principal
Masses and to endeavour to fix your
attention upon their decided characters

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00032|dnp16f30pp|94870071[/page]
On a future [underline]occasion[/underline] I shall fully
examine the other primitive substances
the stones that exist blended with the
primitive Rocks either in beds or [underline]veins[/underline]
the metalic ores that they contain and
their indications
The [underline]primitive Rocks[/underline] in their
position with regard to each other
seldom occur precisely in the [underline]same[/underline]
[underline]arrangement[/underline]
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] is the Rock usually found
at the greatest depth and it is generally
connected with [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical] with
[chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical] or with [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical]
Serpentine [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] and granular
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] often accompany each other:

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00033|dnp16f31pp|94870073[/page]
but Serpentine and granular [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
seldom occur either incumbent upon
or alternating [underline]with [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline].-
Thus in [place]place_021|Cornwall[/place] which is most
distinctly a primitive [underline]Country[/underline]
[underline]The [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline] and [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous[/chemical] and
[underline][chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical][/underline] meet and form the
principal Rocky basis of [underline]the land -[/underline]
The [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] occurs only in alternation
with or upon the [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] and the [underline]Serpentine[/underline]
[underline]district[/underline] is bounded on one side by
[underline]micaceous [chemical]chemical_120|Shists[/chemical][/underline] and on the other side
by Sientite -

[place]place_235|Scotland[/place] are usually found low and
at the bottom of Hills of [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous[line]shist[/chemical] or [chemical]chemical_097|[underline]Sienite[/underline][/chemical] -

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00035|dnp16f33pp|94870080[/page]
There is a similar arrangement
in other great [underline]mountain chains[/underline] -
Thus in the highest eminence of
the [place]place_247|Alps[/place] which is represented in this
sketch - The principle Rocks are
[chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical] -
and [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] forms the great basis
of [underline]Mont Blanc[/underline] -
A number of Geological descriptions
which demonstrate the same facts
may be found in writings of
[person]person_520|M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Luc[/person] and of De [otherwork]otherwork_310|Saussure[/otherwork] but
it will be unnecessary for me to
multiply the instances as they are in
[underline]most cases analagous[/underline] -

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00036|dnp16f34pp|94870083[/page]
All the details of M. de [otherwork]otherwork_310|Saussure[/otherwork] upon
the [place]place_247|Alps[/place] are however in the highest
degree worthy [underline]of being perused[/underline] on
account of their relation to the
structure of the Globe.-
This excellent man constantly studied [underline]Nature[/underline]
with the views of a true [underline]Philosopher[/underline].-
He seldom indulged [underline]in speculation[/underline] - His Theories
are few and founded wholly upon his
own observations.
And his [deletion]narratives[/deletion] narratives are composed
with a simple and unaffected eloquence
which proves that he taught [insertion]sought[/insertion] rather
to communicate knowledge than to excite
admiration.-

The different primitive Rocks have very
different modes of junction and of transition
into each other.-
In some cases the parts of their union
one in [underline]right lines[/underline] a circumstance which
often occurs in the meeting of [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] and porphyry -
Instance
Serpentine Sientite and [underline][chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical][/underline]
sometimes pass into each other by very
[underline]gentle gradations[/underline]
And where granular [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] is placed
upon [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical] near the point
of junction it uniformly contains larger
or smaller proportions [underline]of [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical][/underline] -

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00038|dnp16f36pp|94870092[/page]
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical] sometimes have
their parts mixed at the point of junction
and in other cases they [misc]misc_686|inosculate[/misc] sending
forth distinct ramifications of Veins.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
This fact occurs on a considerable scale at
St [place]place_013|Michaels Mount[/place] in [place]place_021|[underline]Cornwall[/underline][/place];- The great
body of the mountain is [underline]of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline]; but at
its base a stratum of the [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] [underline]occurs[/underline]:
and this layer of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] may be traced
to a considerable extent running into the
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical]. [underline]whilst. ramifications[/underline] of the [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical]
in many [underline]places penetrate[/underline] into the [underline][chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline]
Those in[insertion]oscu[/insertion]lations of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical]
which occur abundantly in different
parts of the world have been subjects of
[deletion]great disputes[/deletion] 

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00039|dnp16f37pp|94870095[/page]
great [underline]disputes[/underline] amongst the various [underline]Theorists[/underline]
[person]person_267|Werner[/person] and most of his disciples considering
them as [underline]veins of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline] attempts to show
that they are [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] of a different kind
from that which forms the first of the
Rocks deposited by chrystalization and
that they are of secondary order and
formed by a much later infiltration of Water
To the [person]person_125|Huttonians[/person] they offer a strong
argument in favour of the formation of
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] by [underline]ingenous fusion[/underline].-
The Rock in which a Vein is found
says [person]person_125|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/person] must have been prior in
existence to the vein itself therefore the
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] must have been formed after the
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical],-

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00040|dnp16f38pp|94870097[/page]
And as the chasm in the [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] has
been completely filled [underline]by the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical][/underline]
this substance must have been fluid
And their exist no agent but fire adequate
to its fusion and to its projection [underline]into[/underline]
the [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical]
Neither the reasonings adopted in
the one theory or in the other will I
conceive carry conviction to the cool
[deletion]observer[/deletion] [underline]and unprejudiced observer[/underline].
The [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] veins (if they be allowed
the name) are almost always similar
in their appearance to the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
Rock with which they are [underline]connected[/underline]:

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00041|dnp16f39pp|94870100[/page]
and this cannot even by the [person]person_267|Wernerians[/person]
be [underline]called with any plausibility a secondary[/underline]
[underline]Rock[/underline]:
With regard to D[superscript]r[/superscript] Huttons oppinion It is
true that where [underline]single and extensive[/underline] [deletion]veins[/deletion]
[underline]inculated veins occur in large Rocks[/underline]:
the Rock must be considered as primary
in its formation when [underline]compared with the[/underline]
[underline]vein[/underline]:
But in a case when two Rocks composed
of very similar materials merely blend by
[underline]ramification[/underline] it is not necessary to suppose
them of different periods of [underline]formation[/underline].-
For there are many cases of [underline]Chystaliza-[/underline]
[underline]-tion[/underline] in which different salts that solidify

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00042|dnp16f40pp|94870102[/page]
at the same time form their solution
[misc]misc_686|inosculate[/misc] with each other and produce
effects not dissimilar to those observed in
the mixture of the primitive Rocks -
On the extensive ground of opinion I
confess that the general structure
and appearances of the primitive
Rocks offer very few facts favourable
to [underline]either Hypothesis[/underline].-
For as I have [underline]already said[/underline] their
principal materials are neither fusible
by fire nor soluble in water - 
As yet no particle of pure [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical]
has been rendered fluid by the

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00043|dnp16f41pp|94870105[/page]
strongest Heat of our furnaces assisted by
the most powerful [underline]effects of Air[/underline]:
And it is therefore scarcely possible to
believe that mountains of [underline]this stone[/underline] more 
than a mile in perpendicular height
and many miles in circumference can
have been rendered fluid by subterraneous
Heat excited without the [underline]access of Air[/underline]
and supposed to act even immediately
[underline]beneath the water of the Ocean[/underline].
There is indeed another strong argumen
[underline]against the primitive[/underline] Rocks having been
formed by fire from the remains of
former Continents and [underline]islands[/underline].

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00044|dnp16f42pp|94870107[/page]
Coal or carbonaceous matter is one of the
substances [underline]very abundant[/underline] upon the
[underline]surface[/underline] and in its pure form it is
an element incapable of [underline]being produced[/underline]
and not in the slightest degree [underline]volatile[/underline]
[underline]by Heat[/underline]
And it ought therefore (assuming the
probability of the theory of [person]person_125|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/person])
to be found in or amongst the groupes
of primitive [underline]substances[/underline], with [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
with [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous shist[/chemical] and with the
serpentine and granular [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
but this [underline]in[/underline] fact [underline]is not the case[/underline],
And in almost all the mountain chains
scarcely any vestiges of Coaly matter occurs

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00045|dnp16f43pp|94870109[/page]
And in no part do they exhibit any
marks of having been produced from
the rivers of a former system containing
organized beings and fitted for the
purposes of life.-
If the [person]person_125|Huttonian[/person] or [person]person_085|Platonic[/person] Theory of
the formation of primitive Rocks be founded

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00046|dnp16f44pp|94870112[/page]
And they make the same agent [underline]at once[/underline]
the dissolving menstruum and the
chrystalizing power.-
Wherever natural causes can be fairly
investigated it is the business of Philosophy
to endeavour to [underline]trace them[/underline]:

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00047|dnp16f45pp|94870114[/page]
And where we can perceive no certain indications
of a prior arrangement there it is reasonable
for us to rest there it is reasonable for us
to fix the foundations of [underline]our Science[/underline].
When [person]person_036|Newton[/person] applied his powerful genius
to the development of the laws of the
planetary system;
He did not begin his researches by endeavouring
to develop how they received their present
forms or how they were endowed with
powers of motion
with true sagacity He left those
questions untouched and instead of
indulging in conjectures and of expressing
himself to the censure of being a Vague
[underline]Theorist [/underline] -

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00048|dnp16f46pp|94870116[/page]
He was contented with the arrangement of
known phenomena and the explanation
of nature by analogy compared with facts
And in consequence He had the Glory
of having discovered some of the most
extensive and most sublime of physical
truths -
[underline]Such an example[/underline] may be [underline]successfully[/underline]
imitated in all researches
In the study of the chemical History
of the Earth [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the first object of enquiry
ought to be [underline]the present-state of things[/underline]
When this is accurately understood
[underline]just deductions[/underline] of reason will
necessarily arise with regard to the

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00049|dnp16f47pp|94870119[/page]
past [underline]and the future[/underline]
If [person]person_125|[underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/underline][/person] and [person]person_267|[underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Werner[/underline][/person] had
contented themselves with explaining
[underline]those operations[/underline] by which our Globe
is constantly preserved as a habitable
World in the series of events at present
[underline]taking place[/underline], they would have deserved
a much higher praise than that of
having been the founders of ingenious
Hypotheses
But when in attempting to explain
appearances they attribute [underline]to agents[/underline]
powers which they have never been
observed to exert, or refer to effects to causes
the operation of which they are ignorant

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00050|dnp16f48pp|94870122[/page]
of their suppositions so not merit the
name of Science: -
Such speculations however brilliant will
pass away [underline]and be forgotten[/underline];
Whilst the facts that have been connected
with them will remain and become
the parts of the more permanent Theory
and of one more conformable to the
true [underline]order of Nature[/underline].-
In the present state of our knowledge
we are wholly unable to explain the
origin of primitive Rocks -
But many [underline]interesting and attainable[/underline]
objects are presented to us in the study
of [underline]their composition[/underline] of the agencies

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00051|dnp16f49pp|94870125[/page]
to which their present state is owing
and of their general uses in the Oeconomy
of [underline]Nature[/underline].-
The appearance of primitive Rocks are
almost infinitely diversified and yet their constituent
parts are comparatively few.-
By the refined methods of Chemistry even
the hardest stones are capable of [underline]being brought[/underline]
[underline]into solution[/underline] and their elements separated
from each other.-
This fluid contains the matter of [chemical]chemical_102|Quartz[/chemical]
Rock dissolved in an [underline]alkaline lixivum[/underline]
And by means of an acid the earth that
it contains may be seperated in a finely
[underline]divided state[/underline] -

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00052|dnp16f50pp|94870127[/page]
By other analogous methods which were
exhibited in [underline]the Autumnal course of Lectures[/underline]
[underline]on chemical analysis[/underline]; may the constituent
principles of other Rocks be separated
[underline]from each other[/underline] and obtained in a [underline]form[/underline]
[underline]of purity[/underline]
And by such experimental processes it
[underline]is demonstrated that[/underline] almost the varieties
of the primitive Rocks that have been
described consist chiefly of different [insertion][underline]combinations[/underline][/insertion]
of four elementary earths, called [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] [underline][chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical][/underline] and a
small quantity of Iron combined
with [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] [underline]or pure Air[/underline].-

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00053|dnp16f51pp|94870130[/page]
[chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] in its pure [deletion]state[/deletion] and chrystalized
form exists in the Sapphire - [chemical]chemical_111|silicious earth[/chemical]
in [chemical]chemical_102|Rock chrystal[/chemical] - 
And caustic [underline][chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical][/underline]and and [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] as they
are usually offered to our attention are the
undecompounded [underline]substances[/underline] known by chemists
under these denominations.-
In [chemical]chemical_104|feld spar[/chemical] the [chemical]chemical_111|silicious earth[/chemical] is combine[insertion]d [/insertion]
with small quantities of the other primitive
earths and when coloured it owes its tint
to the the [underline]combined [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical][/underline] -
[chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical] principally contains [chemical]chemical_111|silicious earth[/chemical]
and aluminous earth with a little [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical]
and [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] is its[underline]colouring colouring nature[/underline]

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00054|dnp16f52pp|94870132[/page]
In [underline][chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_290|shoerl[/chemical][/underline] the quantity of
[underline]iron is greater[/underline]
In serpentine there is a considerable
proportion of [chemical]chemical_011|[underline]Magnesia[/underline][/chemical] united to the other
earths -
But white [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] consists of [underline]pure [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical][/underline]
united to an [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical] called [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
or fixed air whence its effervescence when
acted on by an acid and the coloured
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] owe their tints to [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical]
The [underline]elementary earths[/underline] that form the
constituent parts of Rocks not only differ
from [underline]each other[/underline] in their general [underline]properties[/underline]
but likewise in their [underline]chemical attractions[/underline]
by which they are united.-

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00055|dnp16f53pp|94870135[/page]
And [underline]hence indications[/underline] of the composition
of Stone may in most cases be gained from
their external properties -
Thus the chrystalized stones that principaly
contain [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] substances that
have a very strong affinity [underline]for each other[/underline]
are always very hard and difficult to
[underline]be broken[/underline]
And the greater their hardness the
greater the proportion of [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] -
The stones that contain [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] with
[chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] on the contrary are
usually soft -
And [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] has no attraction for [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical]
and only a slight one for [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] -

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00056|dnp16f54pp|94870138[/page]
And [chemical]chemical_090|[underline]limestone[/underline][/chemical] which is [deletion]soft[/deletion] the softest
of all the primitive Rocks contains [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
united by a weak power of combination
to an [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical] -
At this time I can only mention these
objects information concerning them may
[underline]be found[/underline] in most of the elementary books
of chemistry -
They are connected with Geology but
are not proper subjects for extensive
discussion in a Geological [underline]course[/underline]
The powers of decomposition in
the possession of [underline]chemistry[/underline] [underline]are very[/underline]
[underline]extensive[/underline] but those of composition are
[underline]exceedingly limited[/underline]

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00057|dnp16f55pp|94870140[/page]
As yet none of the arrangements of the primitive
materials of the Globe have been united by
[underline]human invention[/underline].
We recognize the laws of [underline]attraction[/underline] by which
they exist but we are wholly incapable of
[underline]explaining[/underline] the manner in which their
[underline]principles combine[/underline].
And this part of the enquiry concerning
their essence is as yet hidden under the
same veil that conceals the minute facts
concerning their origin.-
[deletion]The primitive Rocks and mountains[/deletion]
[deletion]the structure of which has been [underline]described[/underline][/deletion]
often occurs in [deletion]chasms[/deletion] [underline]chasms[/underline] which extend
for many hundred miles;-

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00058|dnp16f56pp|94870142[/page]
And their Geographical position is of
considerable importance in [underline]the general[/underline]
order of Natural events -
The Heat of the air is derived from
the agency of the rays of the Sun
upon the surface of the earth and it
diminishes in proportion to the height
so that the Atmosphere at three or
four miles high is intensely [underline]cold[/underline] -
Hence the temperature of mountains
is always much lower than that of
plains -
And in all climates of the Globe
when they are above 15 thousand feet

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00059|dnp16f57pp|94870148[/page]
high their tops are covered with perpetual
[underline]Snow[/underline] -
And the height of the point of congelation
[underline]diminishes[/underline] in a regular progression from
the equator [underline]towards the poles[/underline] so that in
our latitude it is about five thousand
feet [place]place_995|[underline]Ben Nevis[/underline][/place] being [underline]very little within[/underline]
the limits of constant [underline]ice[/underline] -
It is in consequence of this [underline]circumstance[/underline]
that mountain chains affect in a high
degree the temperature of the climate
in which they exist -
In the summer currents of cold air are
continually flowing down [underline]their sides[/underline]
which mitigate the burning heat of the
season

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00060|dnp16f58pp|94870151[/page]
In winter they influence the course of
of the winds so as in many cases to
[deletion]protect[/deletion] protect the plains from their
effects -
In [place]place_159|Britain[/place] for instance the principal
[underline]mountains[/underline] occur in the North and
North East part [underline]of the Island[/underline].
And our hottest winds in summer and
our coldest winds [underline]in winter[/underline] blow from
those quarters so that their situation
is well adapted to diminish the heat
in the one case and to break the force
of the cold blast in the [underline]other case[/underline] -
North [place]place_878|America[/place] as is well know is

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00061|dnp16f59pp|94870154[/page]
much colder in winter and hotter in
summer than the parts of Europe under
the same parallels of [underline]Latitude[/underline]
And this seems in great measure to be
owing to the inferiority of its mountains
which are few in number and none
of which can be compared in height to
the [place]place_998|Pyrenees[/place] or the Norwegian [place]place_247|Alps[/place]
and much less to the [place]place_1320|Alps of [underline]Switzerland[/underline][/place]
In South [place]place_878|America[/place] the [underline]great chain of[/underline]
[underline]the [place]place_177|Andes[/place][/underline] though [underline]partly under[/underline] the Equator
[underline]considerably[/underline] tends to diminish the
temperature of the climate and to
render it [underline]habitable[/underline]:

[page]62|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00062|dnp16f60pp|94870157[/page]
[underline]And upon[/underline] a smaller scale it may be
said that the most fertile of the trophical
islands and those the most [underline]luxuriant[/underline]
[underline]in vegetation[/underline] are such as present
the most mountainous aspect.-
The effects of Mountains upon the temperature
of climates are extensive and they possess
other agencies perhaps still more importa[insertion]nt[/insertion]
In consequence of their low temperature
They are constantly precipitating
moisture from the Air or arresting
the Clouds in their progress or from
the thawing of Snow upon them
they are sources of springs and
rivers -

[page]63|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00063|dnp16f61pp|94870160[/page]
And the streams proceeding from them
which at their origin flow only over
bare Rocks and water only moss or the
become in their progress the cause
of the fertility of the rich Valleys
and produce the verdure of the cultivated
[underline]plain.-[/underline]
Even those strata which have no elevation
and which are buried beneath[underline]the Surface[/underline]
act in preserving the consistency of the
[underline]soil[/underline] and they prevent water and
and the matter capable of being [deletion]organiz[/deletion]
organized from penetrating to too
great a depth in [underline]the earth[/underline] where
they would be placed out of the

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11606-000-00064|dnp16f62pp|94870163[/page]
reach of plants and deprived of the
influence of the Atmosphere and
of light -
By the irregularities in the exterior
of the Earth the whole quantity of
surface is considerably [underline]increased [/underline].
And those parts of it which are not
covered with living beings are still
in some measure subservient to
their existence and to their
enjoyment -
