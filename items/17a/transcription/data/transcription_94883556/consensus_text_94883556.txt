Chalk is a secondary substance of the same
composition as Limestone and it differs
from it principally in form of its
[underline]aggregation[/underline] -
It consists of a number of particles [deletion]loosly[/deletion]
losely [underline]adhering to each other[/underline] and not [underline]united[/underline]
[underline]by chemical attraction[/underline] -
Instance
The different Limestone and calcareous Rocks
often occur in different strata in the same
district and they are no less distinguished
by external character than by their
containing different organic [underline]remains[/underline]
