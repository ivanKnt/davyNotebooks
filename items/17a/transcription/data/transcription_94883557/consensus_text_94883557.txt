Thus the shells found in the light grey
and yellow strata of pure [underline]Limestone[/underline]
are very different from those [deletion]she[/deletion] in the
magnesian limestone and the magnesian
limestone containing organic substances
very different from those found in [underline]Chalk[/underline]
Instance
Most of [underline]these shells[/underline] and remains are in
some measure to those of speices at present
existing but in no case I believe perfectly
[underline]identical[/underline] which proves either that there
has been a great change in the generation
of the beings that produced them.
