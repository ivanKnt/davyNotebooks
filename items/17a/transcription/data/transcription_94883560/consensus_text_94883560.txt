has the [underline]appearance[/underline] of [underline]a shell is wholly[/underline]
[underline]Limestone[/underline] will not produce a similar
effect -
The general aspect of secondary limestone
is smooth and regular and its tints are
often rich and varied but unless a section
of it is presented it seldom exhibits much

Its strata are generally disposed in
horizontal layers but they now and then
occur inclined and in a few [deletion]cases[/deletion] cases
curved or bent - in the form of Arches
Under these appearances [underline]Limestone[/underline] exhibits
a strength and boldness of character
