The entire skeleton of a crocodile was
lately discovered in the calcareous sandstone
between Bristol and Bath.
In this work published in 1726 there is
an account of a skeleton found in a sandstone
Rock supposed to be a human skeleton
The paper is entitled an account of the
remains of a man who had witnessed the
deluge but the examination of the [underline]pla[insertion]te[/insertion] [deletion]ce[/deletion][/underline]
will I believe induce every impartial
enquirer to [underline]doubt[/underline] if the bones were human.
To me they seem to resemble much more
the remains of a fish than of a man
or at least it must be allowed that the
Antediluvians if they had such skeletons
