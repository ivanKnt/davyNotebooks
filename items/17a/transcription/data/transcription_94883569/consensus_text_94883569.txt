shewn in the next lecture a strong
indication of [underline]its origin.[/underline]
[underline]Coal[/underline] generally occurs in thin layers or
seams which seldom extend to any considerable
depth - Its appearance in masses is too
well known to need [underline]any elucidations[/underline]
and it and it cannot be mistaken for
any other secondary stratum -
The last great class of the secondary masses
that I shall notice in [underline]this lecture[/underline] is [underline]Win[/underline]
[underline]or Basalt.[/underline] .
These names are applied to very [underline]different[/underline]
[underline]substances[/underline]; but in their philosophical meaning
they ought always to signify stones consisting
principally of [underline]Hornblende and feldspar[/underline]
