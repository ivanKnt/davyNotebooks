Large masses of Basalt often occur containing
no organic remains but in a few instances
vegetable coal is found in it, and now
and then the impressions of [underline]fishes[/underline].
Basalt is distinguished from all other
rocks by the variety of its aspect and by
the singularity and beauty of its arrangement.
It sometimes occurs in layers between
the [underline]other secondary Rocks[/underline] but in this case
it is usually split perpendicularly so
as to form distinct parts of irregular
shapes - [underline]Instance[/underline]
