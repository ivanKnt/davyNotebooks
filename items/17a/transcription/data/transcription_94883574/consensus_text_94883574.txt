Besides the great series of columns there are
several smaler [underline]rows[/underline] round the mouth of
the cave placed one above the other and
the hollows in the [underline]lower[/underline] columns are
fitted to receive the proportions of the upper
[underline]columns[/underline] -
this is a [underline]part[/underline] of one of the small series
of [underline]columns[/underline] which I brought from Staffa
x [underline]last summer[/underline] - I had the satisfaction of
passing a day upon the Island, my expectations
were raised to the highest pitch with regard
to [underline]Fingals Cave[/underline] by the [underline]descriptions[/underline] of
Sir Jos Banks Dr Van Troil and the Hon[superscript]ur[/superscript]
M[superscript]rs[/superscript] yet the scene exalted the highest
sentiment of admiration.
