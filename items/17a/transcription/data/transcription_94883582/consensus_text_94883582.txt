[underline]Instance[/underline]
The Chalk strata are generally distinct
and insulated and seldom alternate with
[underline]any of the other rocks[/underline]
[underline]The strata[/underline] of the secondary rocks in
no case blend or pass into each other by [underline]mixture [/underline]
[underline]or transition[/underline] but they are often wholly separated
by [underline]thin layers[/underline] of soft clay or sand and
this is particularly the case in Derbyshire
Instance
When shist or limestone meet; they are
merely loosely attached to each other; but -
sand stone found upon limestone often
adheres to it with considerable tenacity
but there is never any mixture of their [underline]parts[/underline]
