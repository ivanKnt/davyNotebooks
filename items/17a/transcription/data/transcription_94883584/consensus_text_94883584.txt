[deletion]a[/deletion] on as it has been called Basaltic tafa

the two Classes of Rocks and gives an
excellent idea of the general form of
the [underline]Island[/underline]
Instance
The influence of the great arrangement
of the secondary mountains in the [underline]general[/underline]
[underline]oeconomy of Nature[/underline] is in some respects
similar to that of [underline]the primitive[/underline]
[underline]mountains[/underline]
