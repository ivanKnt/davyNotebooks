Lucretius [deletion]appears[/deletion] [insertion]seems[/insertion] to allude to it in
his second book when he speaks of the
various forms of shells -
And [underline]ovid[/underline] in the fifteenth book of
metamorphoses expresses the notion distinctly
in some lines of which I shall read
a translation
Remains that to the [underline]waters owe their birth[/underline]
Ocean in [underline]Rocks[/underline] beneath the [underline]solid earth[/underline]
Where our Green land their varied face display
Once in proud triumph flowed the [underline]azure sea[/underline]
And in the [deletion]cange[/deletion] [insertion]change[/insertion] of things and lapse of time
The conquering waves have gained [underline]another clime[/underline]
And where another land its verdure spread
So how the moving oceans troubled fled.
