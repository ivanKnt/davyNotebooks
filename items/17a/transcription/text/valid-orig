[underline]Xenophanes[/underline] who lived nearly 520 years before
Christ and who was the founder of the Eleatic
Sect in Greece has noticed that shells and
bones of fishes are imbedded in some of
the marble quarries of Sicily: and He
endeavours to shew from this fact that
an Island must have been covered by the Sea
Herodotus likewise notices [underline]this appearance[/underline]
and states that shells are contained
in considerable quantities in the
mountains of Egypt
And from the general saltness of the
soil brackish taste of the water and

Strabo in his Geography has described some of
the opinions of different philosophers with
regard to the shells and marine relics found
in the interior of various Continents and
Islands.
And Pliny has given an account of the
[underline]properties[/underline] of many of these singluar
substances in his Natural History, but as
usual he has blended his details with a
considerable portion of the [underline]marvellous[/underline]
He has described [unclear]faful[/unclear] oyster shells which
he tells us are certain cures for lameness
and for Blindness
He mentions the shell called the Corni [unclear]stromonis[/unclear]
and the Glass but he considers them

Thus for Plott in his history of
[underline]Oxfordshire[/underline] attributes all the apparent
animal and vegetable remains found
in that County [underline]to a[/underline] [underline]energy [/underline][underline]constantly[/underline]
acting in the bosom of the Earth
and evolving new forms. -
And Sir Thomas Brown supposed that [underline]all[/underline]
[underline]stones arose from seeds[/underline] in the same
manner as plants He even attributed
to them a kind of imperfect vegetative
life the idea of their being in many
cases primary or permanent substances
and endeavoured to deny the notion as a

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00011|dnp17a09pp|94883538[/page]
popular prejudice -
The statement is the more singular as it
occurs in a work written professedly against
vulgar errors and which in other parts often
displays much strength of thought and acuteness
of opinion.-
- combated the idea of the [underline]plastic power[/underline]
but He advanced a notion not much more
correct namely that organic fossils were formed
[underline]either from[/underline] the spawn of [underline]fishes or[/underline] from
organized seeds raised with vapours from the Sea
and conveyed by rain through crevices into
the [underline]depths of the earth[/underline]

It is within the last thirty years that
accurate methods of classing different secondary
strata of the surface; have been develloped
by [underline]Walleruis[/underline], de Luc, Werner Dolomieu and
other celebrated men and that the intimate
natures of the various organic and stoney
substances they contain have been ascertained
by the labours and ingenuity of Pott, Bergman
Scheel, [underline]Klaproth[/underline] and other excellent Chemists
in different parts of Europe and that after
processes which have been constantly approaching,
nearer to [underline]perfection[/underline] - 
[underline]- The secondary Rocks and strata[/underline] differ
from the [underline]primitive[/underline] in a number of
respects -.

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00015|dnp17a13pp|94883542[/page]
[deletion]respects[/deletion]
They are usually arranged in beds [underline]which[/underline]
though often composed in their present forms
[underline]generally exhibit evidences of having[/underline] been
[underline]originally deposited in[/underline] Horizontal [underline]layers[/underline]-
Their elevation is in general much less
considerable than that of the primitive as they
seldom rise more than 3000 feet above the level
of the sea and I believe never exceed 6000
feet - .
The highest secondary mountain in Britain
is Ingleborough in Yorkshire which is more
than 3500 feet above the waters in the
[underline]Irish Channel[/underline]

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00016|dnp17a14pp|94883543[/page]
And the greatest elevation of Rocks containing
organic remains [underline]in the Alps[/underline] is about
7300 feet, and M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc found a
petrified [underline]Cornu Ammonis[/underline] at this height
[underline]in Mount Grenier[/underline].
The Hills containing secondary strata
are always less abrupt in their forms
and more rounded and regular in their
outlines than those composed of primitive
Rocks.
A very good idea of the difference of
[deletion]these[/deletion] [insertion]their[/insertion] aspects may be formed from the
examination of a view of Country

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00017|dnp17a15pp|94883544[/page]
[page]18|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00018|dnp17a16pp|94883545[/page]
All the secondary mountains, the interior
of which has been fully investigated
are found to rest upon the primitive
[deletion]appears[/deletion] rocks and the mode of their union
appears very different [underline]in different cases[/underline]. -
- In some instances when secondary
[underline]Limestone[/underline] occurs incumbent upon silicious
shist the two Rocks are merely closely
cemented together without any blending
of their parts -
And this happens in many points of
the union of the primitive rocks of
the North of Devonshire with the strata

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00019|dnp17a17pp|94883546[/page]
containing organic remains that form
the whole of Somersetshire and a part
south Devon and one of the most
interesting of the Geological facts of this
kind occurs in a cliff a few miles to
the west of [underline]Minehead[/underline] _
Instance
when soft primitive rocks as micaceous
however is contiguous to secondary Rocks
parts of it are sometimes found embedded
[underline]in them[/underline] .
Thus mica and Quartz often appear
mixed with shell Limestone near the
point of junction : -

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00020|dnp17a18pp|94883547[/page]
And when compact marble containing
organic remains is found upon granular
marble there is often an intimate
blending of the two Rocks about the
point of union This last circumstance
is said to occur sometimes in the Laxen
mines ;
Upon these [underline]general facts[/underline] of the
[underline]intermixture[/underline] of the primitive [underline]and[/underline]
[underline]secondary[/underline] substances Werner has
endeavoured to establish a distinct
class of strata under the name of
[underline]transition Rocks[/underline] . -

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00021|dnp17a19pp|94883548[/page]
These facts however occur so seldom and
in general in masses of so small a
magnitude as to render the distinction
[underline]almost unnecessary[/underline] ;
And it is more than probable that
the acute mineralogist of Freighburg
would not have adopted it himself had
not it not been connected with his
peculiar theory of the aqueous origin
off all mountains -
In which as the primitive Rocks
were supposed the [underline]result[/underline] of chrystalization
and the [underline]secondary[/underline] rocks of mechanical
deposition it was necessary to suppose

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00022|dnp17a20pp|94883549[/page]
an intermediate series produced from their
[underline]joint effects[/underline]
The secondary strata laid in their various
positions upon the primitive Rocks occupy
by far the largest portion of the solid
surface in which our soils are [underline]immediately[/underline]
[underline]incumbent[/underline] -
Their properties their Nature and
their arrangement are objects in the
highest degree worthy of a mintue
investigation -
In many of their parts they abound
[underline]with metalic veins[/underline] - They are the beds in
which mineral coal occurs: and They
contain a number of substances subservient

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00023|dnp17a21pp|94883550[/page]
to the uses and comforts [underline]of Man[/underline] -
To the enquirer concerning Natural causes
they are perhaps still more interesting
than the masses of primitive origin -
They are monuments of the great
change that the Globe has [underline]undergone[/underline] .x
- They exhibit indubitable evidences of
a former order of things and of a great
destruction and renovation of living [underline]beings[/underline].
The facts that they present are obscure
but they bear [underline]many analogies[/underline] to existing
phaenomena -
The connection between their causes
and effects is mysterious; but apparently

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00024|dnp17a22pp|94883551[/page]
within the reach of our faculties and
it is displayed in characters which can
be decyphered only with difficulty;
but which express sublime truths.
I shall devote the remainder of
the time allotted to this sitting to the
description of some of the most important
of the secondary strata and to the
discussion of their general arrangement.
I had an intention of entering upon
the enquiry concerning their [underline]origin[/underline]
and the great revolution in Nature
by which they were formed. -

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00025|dnp17a23pp|94883552[/page]
but upon farther consideration I am
inclined to beleive that this subject
will be best examined after the general
facts have been stated in detail -
It is very comprehensive and important
to be well understood it ought to be
fully develloped and it will most
properly form the subject of the
next Lecture -
The secondary strata differ in their
arrangement and position in different
countries but there [underline]is an analogy[/underline] in
their composition and in their [underline]proportion[/underline]

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00026|dnp17a24pp|94883553[/page]
which demonstrates that they are in
all [underline]cases congenerous[/underline] of one family
and produced by similar operations.
Compact Limestone or shell [underline]marble[/underline]
is one of the most common of the [underline]secondary[/underline]
[underline]Rocks[/underline] even when it is examined in
the smalest masses its character appears
perfectly distinct from those of primitive
marble and though its composition is
nearly the same its texture is wholly
different.
It presents either a smooth surface
when broken or a fracture exhibiting
a number of small plates and has

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00027|dnp17a25pp|94883554[/page]
no appearance of being composed of distinct
chrystals.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Secondary marble is of many kinds and
though its principle constituent parts are
uniformly lime and carbonic Acid yet
it often contains [deletion]an[/deletion] other earthy matter
[underline]particularly magnesia[/underline]
The purest limestone are those which
most rapidly [underline]dissolve[/underline] in acids and leave
the smalest quantity of insoluble matter
That limestone [underline]contains magnesia[/underline]
is very difficultly soluble.

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00028|dnp17a26pp|94883555[/page]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The pure limestone is that best fitted
for the purpose of manure and for improv[insertion]ing[/insertion]
lands but the [underline]magnesian Limestone[/underline] in its
calcined state is pernicious to vegetation
though it makes an excellent cement
which becomes solid [underline]and hard under water.[/underline]
|_ The brown and impure Limestone
that contains much Iron and other foreign
matter are likewise generally much more
proper for calcination and application
to the purpose of [underline]building[/underline] than the
white and [underline]semitransparent marbled -[/underline]

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00029|dnp17a27pp|94883556[/page]
Chalk is a secondary substance of the same
composition as Limestone and it differs
from it principally in form of its
[underline]aggregation[/underline] -
It consists of a number of particles [deletion]loosly[/deletion]
losely [underline]adhering to each other[/underline] and not [underline]united[/underline]
[underline]by chemical attraction[/underline] -
Instance
The different Limestone and calcareous Rocks
often occur in different strata in the same
district and they are no less distinguished
by external character than by their
containing different organic [underline]remains[/underline]

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00030|dnp17a28pp|94883557[/page]
Thus the shells found in the light grey
and yellow strata of pure [underline]Limestone[/underline]
are very different from those [deletion]she[/deletion] in the
magnesian limestone and the magnesian
limestone containing organic substances
very different from those found in [underline]Chalk[/underline]
Instance
Most of [underline]these shells[/underline] and remains are in
some measure to those of speices at present
existing but in no case I believe perfectly
[underline]identical[/underline] which proves either that there
has been a great change in the generation
of the beings that produced them.

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00031|dnp17a29pp|94883558[/page]
In [underline]some instances[/underline] the form only of the
organic substances remains and it is filled
up with new stoney matter -
In [underline]other instances[/underline] the yellow and
[underline]glittering compound[/underline] of sulphur [underline]and Iron[/underline]
[underline]called pyrites[/underline]is found to have taken the
place of the original organic matter -
and in some few instances the unaltered
parts of the shells are found -
The remains of the [underline]Nautilus[/underline] exhibit
this fact it retains its lusture and its
beauty and its composition remains
unaltered may be demonstrated by
a very simple experiment -

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00032|dnp17a30pp|94883559[/page]
Mr Hatchet [underline]has shewn[/underline] that the shells of
living Animals contain a [deletion]gell[/deletion] gelatinous
[underline]matter[/underline] which when dissolved in water or
an acid renders turbid the solution of
galls -
A portion of this shell has been dissolved
in a little [deletion]di[/deletion] diluted muriatic acid merely
sufficient to neutralize the lime -
when a solution of Galls is mixed with
it a cloud will be distinct which could
not have happened if the shell had [deletion]merely[/deletion]
been merely lime and carbonic [underline]acid[/underline]
for a solution containing an equal
weight of this [underline]fossil which though[/underline] it

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00033|dnp17a31pp|94883560[/page]
has the [underline]appearance[/underline] of [underline]a shell is wholly[/underline]
[underline]Limestone[/underline] will not produce a similar
effect -
The general aspect of secondary limestone
is smooth and regular and its tints are
often rich and varied but unless a section
of it is presented it seldom exhibits much
[underline]raggedness of outline.[/underline]
Its strata are generally disposed in
horizontal layers but they now and then
occur inclined and in a few [deletion]cases[/deletion] cases
curved or bent - in the form of Arches
Under these appearances [underline]Limestone[/underline] exhibits
a strength and boldness of character

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00034|dnp17a32pp|94883561[/page]
scarcely inferior to those of the primitive
rocks -
and the effects of the mixture of the
regular with the disorderd strata and
the relations [underline]of the curved lines[/underline] to
one an other are well [underline]calculated[/underline] to
awaken the strong emotions [underline]connected[/underline]
with [underline]the perception[/underline] of [underline]natural beauty[/underline]
-[underline]Secondary[/underline] shist like shell limestone is
found in almost all districts that
contain organic [underline]remains[/underline] -
It varies however considerably both in
its [underline]texture[/underline] and [underline]arrangement[/underline]

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00035|dnp17a33pp|94883562[/page]
The hard shist is principally composed
of [underline]silicious matter[/underline] but its colouring
substance is iron its hue is generally
dusky [underline]blue or black[/underline] it does not effervesce
with acids and is difficultly [underline]scratched with[/underline]
[underline]a nife -[/underline] -
The [underline]soft shist[/underline] is much more scaly and less
firm in its texture and has no character
of chrystilization its colour varies from pale
grey to deep [underline]black[/underline] -
The lighter specimens are coloured with
Iron and the darker generally contain
coaly matter -
In the hard shist very few organic
substances are found but [deletion]the[/deletion] soft

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00036|dnp17a34pp|94883563[/page]
shist often contains the remains of
fishes and almost always the [underline]impressions[/underline]
of [underline]plants[/underline] in which carbonaceous [underline]matter[/underline]
[underline]is evident.[/underline]
Those vegetable impressions vary in
their nature in different strata but
the most common speices are similar
[underline]to ferns[/underline].
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The soft shist is almost always
disposed in horizontal layers its height
is seldom considerable nor its appearance
striking.
but [underline]the hard shist[/underline] exhibits a much more
interesting aspect and it often occurs in
irregular [underline]diffused beds[/underline] some of which

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00037|dnp17a35pp|94883564[/page]
are [underline]perpendicular[/underline]as if raised from their
original position and others of [underline]which are[/underline]
curved in a manner [underline]similar[/underline] to limestone.
[underline]Instance[/underline] [underline]lumsden[/underline]
The Cliffs represented in this picture are
nearly 300 feet high and in some places
quite perpendicular their masses are large
and their considerable and their outline
is broken from decomposition.
Sandstone is a [underline]secondary[/underline] Rock
very various in its texture and composition
but it uniformly consists of particles of sand
or gravel cemented together either by
[underline]calcareous[/underline] or silicious [underline]matter[/underline].

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00038|dnp17a36pp|94883565[/page]
It is seldom very firm when calcareous it
effervesces with acids and when silicious
it scratches glass -
Instance
When pebbles are imbedded in stones of this
kind they are called plumb pudden stones
or breccy
It is one of the substances most abundant
in organic remains and often contains the
impressions of entire fishes various shells
and the parts of the land and of marine
plants - Instance
In some few instances the remains of
Quadrupeds are found in this [underline]Rock[/underline] .-

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00039|dnp17a37pp|94883566[/page]
The entire skeleton of a crocodile was
lately discovered in the calcareous sandstone
between Bristol and Bath.
In this work published in 1726 there is
an account of a skeleton found in a sandstone
Rock supposed to be a human skeleton
The paper is entitled an account of the
remains of a man who had witnessed the
deluge but the examination of the [underline]pla[insertion]te[/insertion] [deletion]ce[/deletion][/underline]
will I believe induce every impartial
enquirer to [underline]doubt[/underline] if the bones were human.
To me they seem to resemble much more
the remains of a fish than of a man
or at least it must be allowed that the
Antediluvians if they had such skeletons

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00040|dnp17a38pp|94883567[/page]
must have been very different from
the present inhabitants of the [underline]Globe[/underline]
Sandstone Rocks are much more regular
in the arrangement of their layers
than any other class of secondary
substances - They are almost uniformaly
[underline]disposed parallel to the horizon[/underline]
And their aspect is generally smooth and
uniform -
Instance
[underline]Pit coal[/underline] is always found [underline]in secondary[/underline]
[underline]countries[/underline]. Its basis is the same substance
as charcoal but it is usually impregnated
with [underline]bitumen[/underline] which is the part of the Coal
that fuses and occasion coking and that
[underline]emits[/underline] the vapour which produces flame

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00041|dnp17a39pp|94883568[/page]
Coals differ very much according as they contain
different proportions of fixed coaly matter and
of [underline]Bitumen[/underline]. And they are often adulterated
by Earths and [underline]by the compounds of[/underline] sulphur
[underline]and iron,[/underline] which I have already mentioned
under the name of pyrites -
The best coal is that which burns with a
bright flame and the fumes of which do not
blacken silver held over them and which
leave but a small quantity of Earthy
[underline]residuum[/underline] -
Coals often contain vegetable impressions and
sometimes the remains [underline]of animals.[/underline]
And in [underline]certain states[/underline] it is found possessing
[underline]the texture[/underline] of [underline]wood[/underline] which is as will be

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00042|dnp17a40pp|94883569[/page]
shewn in the next lecture a strong
indication of [underline]its origin.[/underline]
[underline]Coal[/underline] generally occurs in thin layers or
seams which seldom extend to any considerable
depth - Its appearance in masses is too
well known to need [underline]any elucidations[/underline]
and it and it cannot be mistaken for
any other secondary stratum -
The last great class of the secondary masses
that I shall notice in [underline]this lecture[/underline] is [underline]Win[/underline]
[underline]or Basalt.[/underline] .
These names are applied to very [underline]different[/underline]
[underline]substances[/underline]; but in their philosophical meaning
they ought always to signify stones consisting
principally of [underline]Hornblende and feldspar[/underline]

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00043|dnp17a41pp|94883570[/page]
not so [underline]perfectly chrystalized[/underline] as in Sientite [underline]but[/underline]
[underline]in other respects[/underline] the same [underline] as the constituent[/underline]
parts [underline]of this primitive rock.[/underline]
In this specimen of Win or Basalt the
black spots are Hornblende the white the [underline]feldspar[/underline]
Here the distinct chrystals are large but the
gradations in size may be traced till no
visible form can be perceived as in this
stone which is a piece of compact [underline]Basalt[/underline]
from another part of the same Rock.
Basalt is fusible at a white heat is
always sufficiently hard to cut glass and does
not effervesce with Acids, and contains more
than half its weight of silicious earth -

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00044|dnp17a42pp|94883571[/page]
Large masses of Basalt often occur containing
no organic remains but in a few instances
vegetable coal is found in it, and now
and then the impressions of [underline]fishes[/underline].
Basalt is distinguished from all other
rocks by the variety of its aspect and by
the singularity and beauty of its arrangement.
It sometimes occurs in layers between
the [underline]other secondary Rocks[/underline] but in this case
it is usually split perpendicularly so
as to form distinct parts of irregular
shapes - [underline]Instance[/underline]

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00045|dnp17a43pp|94883572[/page]
At other times it is arranged in [underline]columnar[/underline]
masses which are connected as series of regular
pillars and this is the most interesting
and impressive form in which it appears -
the Island of Staffa on the western coast
of Scotland presents one of the most magnificent
views of this kind that has ever been
observed in nature - -
The Coasts of Staffa are about three
miles in circumference and all their upper
parts are composed of ranges of [underline]Basaltic[/underline]
[underline]pillars[/underline] differing in their size and height
but all in [underline]regular forms.[/underline]

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00046|dnp17a44pp|94883573[/page]
- In Fingals Cave in the south west
part of [underline]the Island[/underline] [underline]The Columns extend[/underline]
to the height of 50 feet they are principally
six sided and some of them 3 feet
[underline]in diameter[/underline] -
This picture will represent this
wonderful natural excavation.
It is between 3 & 400 feet in length
and from the surface of the waves to
the top of the Cliff is nearly [underline]200 feet.[/underline]
The pillars are for the most part
six [underline]sided[/underline] but some few occur with
five sides [underline]and some with seven[/underline] -

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00047|dnp17a45pp|94883574[/page]
Besides the great series of columns there are
several smaler [underline]rows[/underline] round the mouth of
the cave placed one above the other and
the hollows in the [underline]lower[/underline] columns are
fitted to receive the proportions of the upper
[underline]columns[/underline] -
this is a [underline]part[/underline] of one of the small series
of [underline]columns[/underline] which I brought from Staffa
x [underline]last summer[/underline] - I had the satisfaction of
passing a day upon the Island, my expectations
were raised to the highest pitch with regard
to [underline]Fingals Cave[/underline] by the [underline]descriptions[/underline] of
Sir Jos Banks Dr Van Troil and the Hon[superscript]ur[/superscript]

With all the regularity of a work of
artificial [underline]production[/underline] It combines a
boldness and a variety which it is in vain
to seek for in human labours nothing
can be more simple or more grand than
the combinations by which it is formed; -
And on this circumstance its strength
and duration depend. -
A few perpendicular and solid pillars
support the [deletion]weight[/deletion] whole of the weighty
mass above and yet they are so
constructed as to resist the waves of the
western ocean by which they are constantly
surrounded and to the [underline]whole force of which[/underline] they

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00049|dnp17a47pp|94883576[/page]
[underline]are constantly[/underline] exposed.
The [underline]Giant's Causeway[/underline] on the coast of [underline]Antrim[/underline]
in [underline]Ireland[/underline] is a Basaltic arrangement
almost as remarkable as that of Staffa
many series of great columns occur
one above the other and they are for
most part articulated or composed of points.
This is a print of [underline]the Giants Causeway[/underline]
It exhibits the great extent and general
arrangements of the Basaltic [underline]rocks[/underline] which
in this part of the Island form the principle
Cliffs of the Coast -
The Basalt of [underline]Antrim[/underline] is similar in its
texture and [underline]composition[/underline] to that of [underline]Staffa[/underline]

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00050|dnp17a48pp|94883577[/page]
But in [underline]the Basalt of Egg[/underline] an Island
to the North of [underline]Staffa pitchstone[/underline] occurs
in the rock mixed with the feldspar
and [underline]Hornblende [/underline]and the Columns in
general have fewer sides -
These columns however in the high
Basaltic mountains of the Island called
Egg are piled together with astonishing
[underline]grandeur[/underline] and they form a precipice
of several hundred feet [underline]in height[/underline]-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The [underline]Basaltic rocks[/underline] alternate with [underline]other[/underline]
[underline]rocks[/underline] in the general scene the whole

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00051|dnp17a49pp|94883578[/page]
picturesque effect is consequently [underline]increased[/underline]
and that delightful emotion of surprise
is awakened in the mind which always
results from a perception of apparent
Art amidst the rude forms in Nature
or of [underline]Nature[/underline] amidst the refinements [underline]of Art[/underline]
The relations of the positions of the different
secondary Rocks that have [underline]been described[/underline] are
almost as diversified as those of [underline]primitive[/underline]
[underline]rocks[/underline] and vary in [underline]particular districts[/underline]
Limestone is the secondary rock generally
discovered at the [underline]greatest depth[/underline] and shist
or sandstone are usually found placed
immediately upon it;

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00052|dnp17a50pp|94883579[/page]
Coal is sometimes discovered upon limestone
but hardly ever under it;
And the strata commonly above coal are
[deletion]coa[/deletion] sand stone and loose [underline]shist[/underline] and
it sometimes occurs beneath Basalt -
Instance
In Derbyshire where the surface has been
penetrated to more than 1500 feet upon
3 regular strata only have [underline]been found[/underline]
of these the first is sandstone the second
brown limestone the third shist the
fourth coal the fifth standstone the sixth
black limestone and the seventh
[underline]grey shell limestone[/underline] -

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00053|dnp17a51pp|94883580[/page]
The Basalt in Derbyshire or the toad stone
as it is regularly called by the miners
forms no regular stratum but occurs in
masses or veins amidst the strata -
Instance
In Durham and Northumberland and
through the great extent of Alstone Moor
in [underline]Cumberland[/underline] the secondary strata
[underline]that [deletion]occur[/deletion] occur[/underline] are heaped on one the
[underline]other in parallel[/underline] layers are more
numerous perhaps than in [underline]any other[/underline]
district.
In Tees [underline]dale[/underline] within 1200 feet in depth
121 Strata occur and which are limestone

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00054|dnp17a52pp|94883581[/page]
sand stone soft shist, hard shist, Basalt
and coal various in thickness and
occurring in an irregular order. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
the extent of the strata may be judged
of from the appearance in the painting
of the fall of the Tees which has been
[underline]already shewn. -[/underline]
The rocks which [underline]are represented[/underline] here
form a part of the general layers
of the Country they are not more than
100 feet high taking the bed of the
river as a level and yet they contain
no less than 7 distinct layers of rock

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00055|dnp17a53pp|94883582[/page]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The Chalk strata are generally distinct
and insulated and seldom alternate with
[underline]any of the other rocks[/underline]
[underline]The strata[/underline] of the secondary rocks in
no case blend or pass into each other by [underline]mixture [/underline]
[underline]or transition[/underline] but they are often wholly separated
by [underline]thin layers[/underline] of soft clay or sand and
this is particularly the case in Derbyshire
Instance
When shist or limestone meet; they are
merely loosely attached to each other; but -
sand stone found upon limestone often
adheres to it with considerable tenacity
but there is never any mixture of their [underline]parts[/underline]

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00056|dnp17a54pp|94883583[/page]
When Basalt is found upon sandstone
or upon [underline]Pudden stone[/underline] which is very
often the case they are always firmly
united. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
In Staffa the Basaltic pillars rests
upon a species of imperfect [underline]Brec[/underline] [deletion]consting[/deletion]
consisting of sand pebbles and fragments
of Basalt united by silicious cement
[underline]containing much Iron[/underline].
And the bases of the columns are
fixed as it were cemented into the
irregular mass beneath -

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00057|dnp17a55pp|94883584[/page]
The junction of Basalt with [underline]Breccia[/underline]
[deletion]a[/deletion] on as it has been called Basaltic tafa
in staffa is well exhibited in two pictures
which as well as the other picture of
Basaltic Rocks were designed by [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Welstem[/underline]
and it perfectly represents the union of
the two Classes of Rocks and gives an
excellent idea of the general form of
the [underline]Island[/underline]
Instance
The influence of the great arrangement
of the secondary mountains in the [underline]general[/underline]
[underline]oeconomy of Nature[/underline] is in some respects
similar to that of [underline]the primitive[/underline]
[underline]mountains[/underline]

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00058|dnp17a56pp|94883585[/page]
They increase the extent of surface
and they are subservient to the
equalization of the temperature of
the climate in which they exist =
more easy of decomposition than the
[underline]primitive[/underline] Rocks they more readily become
the abode of [underline]vegetables[/underline] |_ they supply
the waste of land taking peace in the
vallies and plains -
And from the mixture of their parts
brought into a state of minute division
by the agency of moisture and the
Atmosphere a soil is provided the

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11701-000-00059|dnp17a57pp|94883586[/page]
the best adapted for the nourishment of
plants. -
All the parts of the softer secondary
strata are in a certain degree permeable
to water and in consequence of their
power of retaining this fluid so as to
suffer it gradually to percolate through
them, they remain saturated with it
in all seasons and are the principle
sources of those streams which flow in
the heats of [underline]summer[/underline] and the dryest
[underline]weather[/underline] and which are absolutely [underline]essential[/underline]
[underline]to the[/underline] existence of [underline]Vegetables and[/underline]
[underline]animals[/underline]
