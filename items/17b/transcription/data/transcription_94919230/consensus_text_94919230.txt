None of the facts concerning the formation
of the secondary rocks can be immediately Known
All our reasoning upon them must be
inductive.
They must be founded upon the knowledge
of the properties of the substances that
compose the strata and of the agents by
which these substances are capable of
being modified
And where [underline]causes[/underline] can be plausibly
develloped it must be from the examinati[insertion]on[/insertion]
of existing operations that produce
appearances similar to those which
are the objects of enquiry
