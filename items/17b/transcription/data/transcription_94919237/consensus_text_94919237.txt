appearance of being produced by a
deposition from water and the effect
is very little compatable with the idea
of [underline]igneous fusion[/underline] of the materials of
the strata.-
The strongest argument that has been
produced for the [underline]agency of fire[/underline] is derived
from the fact of the curvature of some
of the calcareous strata
This it has been said almost proves
that they were in a [underline]soft state[/underline] and
that they were elevated at the time
of their formation by some force
acting from beneath -
