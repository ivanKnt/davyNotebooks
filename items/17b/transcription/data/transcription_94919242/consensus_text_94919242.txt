I particularly recolect one in a
quarry [underline]near Edinburgh[/underline] in which
pieces of win of very different shapes
occured in the rock and win is
fusible at a heat which would
scarcely affect [underline]the sandstone.[/underline]
As silicious sandstone is found both
above and below shell [underline]Limestone[/underline] it
is scarcely possible to doubt but
that some of the same causes must
have operated in the production
of both these classes of [underline]stones[/underline]
