Where wood has been buried in the Earth
in late times |_ from the action of
water and of air it always undergoes
a change which brings it to a state
similar to that of Pit Coal -
[underline]At Bovey in devonshire[/underline] a whole forest
is found buried under different strata of
clay and gravel and the trees though
Carbonaceous and black have their ligeneous
form and contain a substance apparently
intermediate between bitumen and
[deletion]resin[/deletion] as has been shewn by [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatchet[/underline]
