of the coal strata. -
|_ Vegetable matter in its first state
of fermentation [underline]appears as heat[/underline] -
In another and more advanced [underline]state[/underline]
it is the same substance as Bovey
coal - and when the Bitumen is
completely formed it is [underline]the true fossil[/underline]
[underline]coal[/underline] in which the ligneous texture
is sometimes evident and sometimes
destroyed -
In a Quarry near Glasgow vegetable
matter is found in almost all its
different states of conversion -
Near the surface it is but little
decomposed and here it occurs in a very
imperfect sandstone apparently of late formation
