In the western Islands of [underline]Scotland[/underline] and
in the coast of Antrim all the great

which exhibit no marks of the agency of
fire -
At the giants Causeway the [deletion]Baslat[/deletion]
[underline]the Basalt[/underline] is said to alternate with
[underline]sandstone[/underline] and at Staffa as appears from
from the sketch and as I mentioned in the
last lecture it is placed upon a [underline]Breccia[/underline]
which contains, immediately below the
pillars fragments of a stone equally
fusible with [underline]Basalt[/underline] -
