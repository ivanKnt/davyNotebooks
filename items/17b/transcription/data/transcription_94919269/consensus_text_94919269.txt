[underline]That the various strata[/underline] filled with
organic remains were covered by the
sea at the time of [underline]their production[/underline]
This is the ancient Theory which [underline]will[/underline]
[underline]not be[/underline] disputed though many modifications
of [underline]it may be formed:[/underline]
And various arguments must be stated
before it can be decided whether the strata
were formed by slow operations or by
rapid changes whether they were the
works of days or of ages and whether
the present land was anciently the bed
of the Ocean or whether the secondary
rocks were formed upon it by a
great influx of waters.-
