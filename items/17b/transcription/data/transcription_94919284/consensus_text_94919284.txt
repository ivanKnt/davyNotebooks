instances is perhaps to indulge too
much in the spirit of speculation
What ever may be the cause assigned
for this great event it must be
considered as one independent of the

the usual changes of the Sea and

nothing analogous occurs and it
must be referred to some power operating
in a novel manner in our Systems
As yet we are not perfectly able
to explain the existing oeconomy
