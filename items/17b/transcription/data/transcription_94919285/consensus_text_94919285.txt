of things and our Theories of past
changes must be more incomplete
the more these changes are remote
Placed as it were [underline]mere atoms[/underline] upon
[underline]a point of space[/underline] we perceive only
a few objects and a few of their
relations and to these we are [deletion]oblidged[/deletion]
obliged to refer in all our reasonings
whilst in the universal series of
occurances influences may have
acted and may be still acting of
which we have no conception
Yet [underline]nevertheless[/underline] it is proper that
we [underline]should reason[/underline] from [underline]the present[/underline]
