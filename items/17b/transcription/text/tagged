Whenever any circumstance occur which mark
distinct periods or a succession of events in
Nature they uniformly supply means of
investigation and enable us to reason concerning
the relations of their causes.-
In considering the secondary strata filled
with organic remains and containing the
vestages of many beings analogous to living
generations it is scarcely possible to
avoid speculation.-

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00008|dnp17b06pp|94919228[/page]
And even the most sober and cool understanding
is almost irresistably led to form ideas
concerning the state of things existing at
their origin and concerning the powerful
material agents subservient to those great
Natural events, the occurrences of which
is demonstrated by their arrangement and
wonderful appearances-
The subject is one of high interest:
but it ought to be pursued with considerable
caution men possessing very brilliant talents
have differed essentially upon it. Hypotheses

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00009|dnp17b07pp|94919229[/page]
have been multiplied with regard to it
and much ingenuity and labour have been
employed upon the disscussion
In accounting for the present order of
things, we are enabled constantly to appeal
[underline]to the[/underline] [underline]senses[/underline] to combine [underline]observation[/underline] and
experiment: but in attempting to explain
the past change in [underline]Nature[/underline]; if we are in
possession of no distinct History, analogy is
our only guide.
Inferences must be made from the known
concerning the unknown facts. And the
mind if unable to obtain certainty must
rest satisfied with strong probability.-

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00010|dnp17b08pp|94919230[/page]
None of the facts concerning the formation
of the secondary rocks can be immediately Known
All our reasoning upon them must be
inductive.
They must be founded upon the knowledge
of the properties of the substances that
compose the strata and of the agents by
which these substances are capable of
being modified
And where [underline]causes[/underline] can be plausibly
develloped it must be from the examinati[insertion]on[/insertion]
of existing operations that produce
appearances similar to those which
are the objects of enquiry

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00011|dnp17b09pp|94919231[/page]
Amongst the secondary Rocks, [chemical]chemical_090|[underline]limestone[/underline][/chemical]
is that which occupies the most important
place: and it is the [underline]stratified substance[/underline]
perhaps the most interesting in its
relations to general theory. -
[underline]All [chemical]chemical_184|Shell Limestone[/chemical][/underline] when minutely
examined exhibit a texture which proves
that their constituent parts at the time
they were deposited upon the organic
remains were in a state of [underline]liquidity or[/underline]
[underline]solution[/underline] -
[deletion]This inference it is not possible to[/deletion]
[deletion]doubt the interior[/deletion]

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00012|dnp17b10pp|94919232[/page]
This inference it is not possible [underline]to doubt[/underline] -
The interior of the shells in marble are almost
always filled [underline]with chrystals[/underline] chrystals likewise
abound in various parts of [deletion]the[/deletion] these stones
as their formation must have been subsequent
to that of the organic bodies they include
and it implies a previous state of
[underline]chemical division [/underline] -
This a principle fact admitted in
all the Theories of Geology, but explained
in different manners -
The only two Agents which act
upon a great scale in Nature in [underline]producing[/underline]

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00013|dnp17b11pp|94919233[/page]
fluidity or solution are [underline]Fire[/underline] and [underline]Water[/underline]
and these being the only powers which
could have operated in the production
of the secondary strata at least to known
to us are the only powers concerning the
agencies of which we have a right to
conjecture. -
It has long been known that [chemical]chemical_090|[underline]limestone[/underline][/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical] [underline]is soluble[/underline] to a small
extent in water. Almost all our common
pumps and river water contain it
and it is more soluble in water
impregnated with [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] or[deletion]f[/deletion] fixed
Air [underline]than[/underline] in pure [underline]water[/underline].

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00014|dnp17b12pp|94919234[/page]
It has likewise been shown by some late
[underline]experiments[/underline] that this [underline]substance[/underline] is capable
of being fused by Heat.
When [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] is ignited in our fires
the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] which forms almost half
of its weight flies off and the pure
[chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] is wholly infusible.
But when [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] Heated strongly in
close vessels from which the [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical]
cannot escape the compound is readily
softened and becomes fluid at a white heat
This is a beautiful discovery of [person]person_164|Sir James[line]Hall[/person], I have had the pleasure of examining
his specimens and of witnessing his

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00015|dnp17b13pp|94919235[/page]
method and I have seen pieces of compact
stone even containing chrystals which
had been formed by heat under [underline]pressure[/underline]
[underline]from coarsely powdered[/underline] chalk. -
As both the [underline]great Agents[/underline] of Nature
are capable of rendering the constituent
parts of [chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical] [underline]fluid[/underline] we
must be guided by the appearances in
endeavouring to decide which was most
probably concerned in the production
of the secondary [chemical]chemical_090|[underline]limestone[/underline][/chemical] -
The shells contained in [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
preserve their perfect forms and some
have their texture unaltered. -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00016|dnp17b14pp|94919236[/page]
Now it is difficult to conceive that
this could have happened if they had
been surrounded by melted matter for
they must themselves have been brought
into fusion and consequently ought
to be found of the same texture and
compactness as the stone in which they
are [underline]imbedded[/underline] or at least they ought
to have been in some measure altered
in their form or composition.-
The greater number of shell
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] are disposed in alternate
layers; and these have every

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00017|dnp17b15pp|94919237[/page]
appearance of being produced by a
deposition from water and the effect
is very little compatable with the idea
of [underline]igneous fusion[/underline] of the materials of
the strata.-
The strongest argument that has been
produced for the [underline]agency of fire[/underline] is derived
from the fact of the curvature of some
of the calcareous strata
This it has been said almost proves
that they were in a [underline]soft state[/underline] and
that they were elevated at the time
of their formation by some force
acting from beneath -

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00018|dnp17b16pp|94919238[/page]
Instance
These are [insertion]the[/insertion] sketches of the [underline]arched strata[/underline]
you saw them in the former lecture
To me they seem unconnected with any
effect of heat and they may easily be
accounted for [underline]by supposing[/underline] an arched
form in the surface upon which the
first layer was [underline]deposited[/underline]
There are [underline]analogous instances[/underline] which
occur every day. This is a piece of
[chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical] having all the properties
of [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] which was formed in
the boiler of [underline]a steam[/underline] engine supplied
with the water of the [place]place_825|Thames[/place] -

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00019|dnp17b17pp|94919239[/page]
When magnified it appears wholly composed
of curved layers -
And this sketch represents a section of it
enlarged about five hundred times -
The same general conclusions may be
applied with regard to [underline]calcareous sand[/underline]
[underline]stone[/underline]: which consists of particles that
had [underline]not been in solution[/underline] cemented
by [chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical] which had been
in solution so as to assume a chrystaline
form-
On the subject of [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_088|[underline]sandstone[/underline][/chemical]
a new order of facts must be brought
forward.-

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00020|dnp17b18pp|94919240[/page]
The constituent parts of this substance
are infusible by any heat that has
been as yet applied in our artificial
processes; But [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] sand is soluble
under certain circumstances . -
Thus the boiling water which spouts
from the Giezer in [place]place_237|Iceland[/place] was found
by [person]person_231|Dr Black[/person] impregnated with [chemical]chemical_111|silicious earth[/chemical]
And [chemical]chemical_111|silicious earth[/chemical] appears to be capable
of being dissolved by the fluids of plants
for I have detected it deposited in consider[insertion]able[/insertion]
quantities in the interior of various
Grasses and [underline]in the rattan[/underline] -

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00021|dnp17b19pp|94919241[/page]
And [person]person_611|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Macie[/person] found large nodules of
[chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] concretions within the points
of the Bamboo. -
That [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] cannot owe its
compactness or its chrystalized texture
to the agency of fire even allowing it
capable of being fused is I think
evident from many appearances -
Thus there are often found embeded in
[underline][chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] sandstones[/underline] fragments of very
fusible rocks not apparently altered & nor
rounded in their forms this I have
seen in several Instances;

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00022|dnp17b20pp|94919242[/page]
I particularly recolect one in a
quarry [underline]near [place]place_284|Edinburgh[/place][/underline] in which
pieces of win of very different shapes
occured in the rock and win is
fusible at a heat which would
scarcely affect [underline]the [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical].[/underline]
As [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] is found both
above and below shell [chemical]chemical_090|[underline]limestone[/underline][/chemical] it
is scarcely possible to doubt but
that some of the same causes must
have operated in the production
of both these classes of [underline]stones[/underline]

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00023|dnp17b21pp|94919243[/page]
And consequently the only probable
agent to which we can refer the
solution of the [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] matter is water
either heated or under some peculiar
circumstances of [underline]combination[/underline] - 
The different species of shistous Rocks
present no chrystalized texture, and some
of them are capable of being fused
and most of them are hardened by fire.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
There is consequently very little reason
to suppose that this agent was concerned
in [underline]their production[/underline].
And their origin may with a much
higher degree of [underline]probability[/underline] be [underline]referred[/underline]

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00024|dnp17b22pp|94919244[/page]
to a deposition of [underline]minute solid particles[/underline]
of argillaceous and [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] matter
which had been mechanically suspended
in water and of which the present
adhesion is owing to Bitumenous
[underline]matter or [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical][/underline]
Chalk which [underline]consists[/underline] of particles of
[chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical] merely in a state
of mechanical adhesion must as there
is every reason to [deletion]believe[/deletion] beleive
like [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] have been produced by the
deposition of [underline]solid matter[/underline] finely divided
and [underline]suspended in a fluid[/underline] -

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00025|dnp17b23pp|94919245[/page]
With regard to the strata of [chemical]chemical_106|Flint[/chemical] which
generally alternate with chalk it is very
difficult to assign any satisfactory cause for
[underline]their formation[/underline] -
That they could not have been produced
by fusion is evident for if their constituent
parts are at all capable of being rendered
liquid by Heat it can only be by a degree
much more intense than we are able to
produce; and such a heat acting under
pressure must [deletion]have[/deletion] necessarily have likewise
fused The calcareous matter surrounding them
It very often happens that perfect
impressions of the [misc]misc_344|Echinces[/misc] are found filled
with [chemical]chemical_106|Flint[/chemical] whilst the exterior is chrystalize[insertion]d[/insertion]
[chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical]

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00026|dnp17b24pp|94919246[/page]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Now it is scarcely possible to conceive that
this could have taken place unless
the [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] matter had been [underline]carried[/underline]
through the orifices of the shell and
deposited in the cavity by a fluid
and gradually acting menstruum -
On the subject of the origin of [underline]Coal[/underline]
there have been [underline]various opinions[/underline]
But the vegetable and animal
impressions that it contains as I
mentioned in the last lecture ought
to lead us without much minute
discussion to the theory of its production -

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00027|dnp17b25pp|94919247[/page]
Where wood has been buried in the Earth
in late times |_ from the action of
water and of air it always undergoes
a change which brings it to a state
similar to that of Pit Coal -
[underline]At Bovey in [place]place_162|Devonshire[/place][/underline] a whole forest
is found buried under different strata of
clay and gravel and the trees though
Carbonaceous and black have their [misc]misc_873|ligneous[/misc]
form and contain a substance apparently
intermediate between [chemical]chemical_175|Bitumen[/chemical] and
[deletion]resin[/deletion] as has been shewn by [underline][person]person_149|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatchet[/person][/underline]

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00028|dnp17b26pp|94919248[/page]
A similar species of Coal is found in
[place]place_161|Sussex[/place] and in [place]place_237|Iceland[/place] where it is named
Surtabrand and the pieces appear flattened
[deletion]probably[/deletion] from the pressure of [insertion]the[/insertion] superincumbent
mass during the time of the conversion
of the [underline]wood[/underline] into [underline]Coaly matter[/underline] _|
Vegetable and animal substance may
however likewise be converted into a
body resembling Pit Coal by Heat under
pressure [person]person_164|Sir James Hall[/person] has shewn
This making use of the same means as
those employed in his experiments upon
[chemical]chemical_090|[underline]limestone[/underline][/chemical] -

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00029|dnp17b27pp|94919249[/page]
He has proved that by a strong heat
applied to different animal matter and
different species of wood in close vessels
a substance is produced black and glossy
and having properties different from
those of common [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] as it burns
with a dense flame giving out [underline]volatile[/underline]
matter -
Sir James has adduced his experiments
as proof of the [otherwork]otherwork_097|Huttonian Theory[/otherwork] of the
igneous origin of pit coal; his arguments
are in the highest degree ingenious and
if the insulated facts only were to be
considered very forcible and convincing .-

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00030|dnp17b28pp|94919250[/page]
But when the usual [underline]strata[/underline] above
and below coal are examined it is
scarcely possible for the impartial
observer to suppose that they had been
subjected [underline]to heat[/underline] -
They are principally loose [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical]
and loose [chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] bearing every mark
of having been deposited from a state
of mechanical [underline]suspension in water[/underline] -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The agency of water and the natural
process of decomposition to which all
organized matter is liable this seems
fully adequate to explain the appearances

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00031|dnp17b29pp|94919251[/page]
of the coal strata. -
|_ Vegetable matter in its first state
of fermentation [underline]appears as heat[/underline] -
In another and more advanced [underline]state[/underline]
it is the same substance as [place]place_692|Bovey[line]coal[/place] - and when the [chemical]chemical_175|Bitumen[/chemical] is
completely formed it is [underline]the true fossil[/underline]
[underline]coal[/underline] in which the [misc]misc_873|ligneous[/misc] texture
is sometimes evident and sometimes
destroyed -
In a Quarry near [place]place_887|Glasgow[/place] vegetable
matter is found in almost all its
different states of conversion -
Near the surface it is but little
decomposed and here it occurs in a very
imperfect [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] apparently of late formation

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00032|dnp17b30pp|94919252[/page]
In a lower stratum about ten feet
below it has the appearance of wood
slightly charred; and in the compact
and white [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] which is used
for building it occurs [deletion]apparently[/deletion]
converted into Bituminous Coal -_|
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The last subject of particular theory
which it will be necessary to discuss
is perhaps the most [underline]difficult[/underline] and
the most connected with the operation
of unknown powers. I mean the
formation of [underline][chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] Rocks[/underline]. -

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00033|dnp17b31pp|94919253[/page]
For a long while all [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] was
considered as a volcanic production;
but since it has been found alternating
with other rocks deposited in regular
layers this generalization has been
given up by a number of Philosophers
and a more limited Theory adopted
[chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] as was shewn in the course
of the last lecture to be a chrystalized
substance consisting of [chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical] and
feld spar-
Its elements are not soluble in
common water but they are capable
of being rendered fluid by Heat though
after fusion they have never yet been

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00034|dnp17b32pp|94919254[/page]
made to assume their original [underline]form[/underline] -
It is not possible therefore to account
for the origin of the Rock satisfactorily
from any certainly known [underline]facts[/underline].-
And we must be [underline]contented with presumtive[/underline]
[underline]evidence from the[/underline] particular appearances
which [underline]it presents and the[/underline] circumstances under
which [underline]it is found[/underline] -
All the [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] Rocks of great extent
as [underline]yet examined[/underline] have been discovered upon
common secondary Rocks containing organic
remains -
And these layers of [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] extending over
many square [underline]miles[/underline] often occur between

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00035|dnp17b33pp|94919255[/page]
strata of [underline][chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] and of [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical][/underline] of the
common kind and having nothing peculiar
in their aspect. -
The same [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] strata which occur
in [underline][place]place_373|Teesdale[/place][/underline] and which are represented in
this sketch extend into the north into [place]place_306|Alstone[/place]
more: and they have been traced more than
thirty miles and they are uniform[deletion]a[/deletion]ly found
between the same shistous strata; and the
[chemical]chemical_120|Shist[/chemical] below them and incumbent upon them
contains organic [underline]remains[/underline] and is exceedingly
soft though when acted upon by a Heat
much below that necessary for fusing
[chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] it becomes very [underline]hard Instance[/underline]

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00036|dnp17b34pp|94919256[/page]
and at the white Heat it is itself capable
of being rendered fluid.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
So that it is impossible to suppose that
this [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] stratum was ever in igneous
fusion - 
The same reasoning may be applied in
accounting for the arrangement in the
other layers of [underline][chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] Rocks[/underline] found
in the same district. I have examined
three of the lower strata and to me they
have uniform[deletion]a[/deletion]ly appeared to exhibit
analagous facts. -

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00037|dnp17b35pp|94919257[/page]
In the western Islands of [place]place_235|[underline]Scotland[/underline][/place] and
in the coast of [place]place_301|Antrim[/place] all the great
and Majestic arrangements of [chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical]
are uniformly incumbent [underline]upon[/underline] Rocks
which exhibit no marks of the agency of
fire -
At the [place]place_126|Giants Causeway[/place] the [deletion]Baslat[/deletion]
[underline]the [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical][/underline] is said to alternate with
[chemical]chemical_088|[underline]sandstone[/underline][/chemical] and at [place]place_1193|Staffa[/place] as appears from
from the sketch and as I mentioned in the
last lecture it is placed upon a [underline][chemical]chemical_170|Breccia[/chemical][/underline]
which contains, immediately below the
pillars fragments of a stone equally
fusible with [chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical] -

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00038|dnp17b36pp|94919258[/page]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] Rocks in the [underline]neighbourhood of[/underline]
[underline][place]place_284|Edinburgh[/place][/underline] are all almost fixed upon sand
[underline]stone [chemical]chemical_120|Schist[/chemical] or [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical][/underline]: but their arrangement
is much more disturbed than in most other
[underline]cases[/underline] -
In the [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] mountains called Arthurs
Seat [underline]several layers[/underline] of irregularly disposed
[chemical]chemical_223|columnar basalt[/chemical] are formed Alternating
with [chemical]chemical_088|[underline]sandstone[/underline][/chemical].
And at the point of junction the
[chemical]chemical_088|[underline]sandstone[/underline][/chemical] is of a different texture considerably
harder and of a red colour. -
This fact was adduced by [person]person_125|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/person]
as a demonstration of the igneous

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00039|dnp17b37pp|94919259[/page]
origin of [chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical] He supposed that
the materials of it being projected in
a fluid state amongst the strata of
[chemical]chemical_088|[underline]sandstone[/underline][/chemical] had hardened them at the
[underline]point of contact[/underline] and given them a new
texture
I have paid particular attention to this
appearance I exhibited a specimen of the
junction of the [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical] in
the last lecture -
This is a piece of the general
[underline]layer of [chemical]chemical_088|Sandstone[/chemical][/underline] in its softest state
I have exposed a part of this layer
to a Heat sufficient to fuse [chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical] :
but I do not find that it in any
[underline]considerable degree[/underline] -

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00040|dnp17b38pp|94919260[/page]
And in examining the hard mass in
contact with the [chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical] and in
comparing it with the soft mass
below it I find that their difference
does not depend upon a different
consolidation of the same matter; but
upon a real difference [underline]of compaction[/underline]
for the hard substance contains much
more [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] matter than the soft one
Some of the pillars of the Great
[chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] Arrangments often occur in a
bent form and curved and this has
been brought forward as an argument
for their having been fluid. but the

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00041|dnp17b39pp|94919261[/page]
same explanation may be given of this
phaenomena of the curvature of strata
The columnar forms generally speaking
indeed offers no evidences in favour of
the igneous fusion.
It is said that some of the lavas of [place]place_184|Etna[/place]
where they have flowed into the sea are
found in the state of pillars but these
are rare instances;
Similar effects takes place much more
commonly during the drying of masses
which have been consolidated by the
agency of water -
Thus the common form of starch is
produced at the time of its drying and
if pure [insertion]Clay[/insertion] be made and spread upon a
[underline][/underline]

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00042|dnp17b40pp|94919262[/page]
large surface it always splits at the
time of the evaporation of the moisture
[underline]into pieces[/underline] many of which have regular
forms -
All the facts seem to render it probable
that the [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] rocks usually found
in alternation with the common secondary
Rocks cannot be of igneous origin;
But the proposition [underline]of the[/underline] improbability
of the formation of this substance
by fire must not be [underline]advanced[/underline]; -
In many secondary and primitive
countries veins or dikes of [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]
[underline]are found[/underline] which have many characters

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00043|dnp17b41pp|94919263[/page]
similar to those of lava and which
often appear to have produced similar
effects -
At Cockfield in [place]place_1029|Durham[/place] the coal strata
are intersected by a vein of [chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical]
and where this substance comes in
contact with the inflamable matter
its effects are precisely similar to
those which would be produced by
fire -
The [chemical]chemical_175|Bitumen[/chemical] of the Coal is driven
off and the coal appears as coke
In [place]place_1359|Northumberland[/place] and in [place]place_085|Derbyshire[/place]
there are analogous [underline]instances[/underline]. -

[underline]Instance[/underline]
I have had but few opportunities of examining
the kind of [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] which fills [deletion]these dikes[/deletion]
[underline]these dikes[/underline] but in the specimens that
I have seen it has appeared of a much
finer grain than the common [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]
and approaching nearer in its nature
to lava
[underline]Instance[/underline]
I have already mentioned that [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]
may be fused and after fusion may be
made to Chrystalize by slow cooling
though its constituent parts do not
seperate into the distinct forms of
[chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] whether the
chrystals are ever [deletion]seperately[/deletion] [insertion]perfectly[/insertion] distinct
[underline]in the [chemical]chemical_105|basaltic[/chemical] dikes[/underline] I am not able to decide

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00045|dnp17b43pp|94919265[/page]
[person]person_164|Sir [underline]Ja[superscript]s[/superscript] Hall[/underline][/person] by preserving [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical] in a
state of imperfect fluidity for a considerable
time at last procured a body exceedingly
analogous in its general appearance to
the original stone. -
His experiments were repeated upon a
much larger [deletion]scale[/deletion] mass of the same substance
by [person]person_261|M[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_261|Gregory Watt[/person][/person] -
There is in this drawer a series of
the [underline]specimens[/underline] produced in different states
of graduation from a more opaque glass
to an assemblage of Uniform Chrystals. -
[person]person_261|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Watts[/person] [otherwork]otherwork_230|paper[/otherwork] may be found in the last
volume of the [otherwork]otherwork_004|philosophical Transactions[/otherwork]

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00046|dnp17b44pp|94919266[/page]
and it is filled with curious reasoning
and with useful information -
It was the first and the last production
of an [underline]early matured genius[/underline] who had
devoted himself to Geology [deletion]who[/deletion] and who
had given the strongest promise of
promoting its most important objects -
[person]person_146|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Watt[/person] had examined a number of
the most perfectly formed volcanic specimens
with great attention - He had accurately
compared them with the [underline]stratafied[/underline]
[chemical]chemical_105|[underline]Basalt[/underline][/chemical] and He was fully of opinion
that substances very nearly alike might
be formed both by aqueous deposition and by
aqueous fusion -

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00047|dnp17b45pp|94919267[/page]
He had himself no particular Hypotheses
and He had opposed the different to each
other with great fairness and caution
and He was preparing a series of experiments
to elucidate the general History, unfortunately
He did not live to execute his designs, -
and those only whe were intimately
acquainted with the extent of his
Knowledge the quickness of his perception
and teh accuracy of His judgement those
only can estimate the serious loss that
science has sustained by his [underline]recent death[/underline]
I have now stated and I hope without
any prejudice of system those opinions

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00048|dnp17b46pp|94919268[/page]
belonging to the different Theories
which offer the most plausible
explanation of the causes that appear
to have [underline]operated[/underline] in producing and
consolidating the particular [underline]secondary[/underline]
[underline]strata[/underline].-
Concerning their general arrangements
and the revolutions in nature connected
with it I have as yet offered no
supposition but this part of the
subject necessarily follows in the
order of discussion. -
All the appearances all the different
[underline]facts shew[/underline] in the most decided manner

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00049|dnp17b47pp|94919269[/page]
[underline]That the various strata[/underline] filled with
organic remains were covered by the
sea at the time of [underline]their production[/underline]
This is the ancient Theory which [underline]will[/underline]
[underline]not be[/underline] disputed though many modifications
of [underline]it may be formed:[/underline]
And various arguments must be stated
before it can be decided whether the strata
were formed by slow operations or by
rapid changes whether they were the
works of days or of ages and whether
the present land was anciently the bed
of the Ocean or whether the secondary
rocks were formed upon it by a
great influx of waters.-

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00050|dnp17b48pp|94919270[/page]
[person]person_520|M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Luc[/person] a part of whose theory I
noticed [underline]in a former lecture[/underline] in his last
publication the letters to [person]person_241|Blumenback[/person]
attempts to shew that the secondary Rocks
were all produced long [underline]before the[/underline] creation
of [underline]Man[/underline].-
[underline]He conceives[/underline] that the original Ocean
held in solution all the matters that
compose them;
And that these matters were deposited
and consolidated at the time that the
waters were peopled with marine
[underline]plants and animals[/underline].-

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00051|dnp17b49pp|94919271[/page]
Reasoning upon the sucessive depositions
of strata He supposed that an immense
length of time must have been essential
to their formation and He believes that
the six days in Genesis mean periods
almost [underline]indefinitely great[/underline]
It is with regret that I was [deletion]obliged[/deletion] 
again obliged to express an opinion
very different from that of this venerable
philosopher
But in appealing to the most simple
and obvious analogies only his Hypothesis
seems incapable of being reconciled
to the appearances. -

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00052|dnp17b50pp|94919272[/page]
Supposing that the ocean had held in
solution the [underline]different substances[/underline] which form
the secondary strata.
On M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Lucs Theory there is no cause
for their [underline]precipitation[/underline] no new agent is
supposed to be introduced and as the same
bodies uniformly preserve the same attraction
for each other:
The series of events that He has assumed are
contradictory to the established chemical laws
Besides supposing a fluid saturated with
[chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] matter with the other earths and
with the metals it is scarcely possible
to conceive that it was fitted for the
purpose [underline]of life[/underline]!

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00053|dnp17b51pp|94919273[/page]
or that it could have been the abode of Marine
Animals at the time the great changes of
composition which M[superscript]r[/superscript] [deletion]DeLic[/deletion] [person]person_520|de Luc[/person] imagines
were Taking place in it
The existance of Coal strata of [underline]vegetable[/underline]
[underline]and animal origin[/underline] alternating with the
other secondary Rocks seems almost decidedly
to shew that their formation took place
upon a surface which had before been
[underline]habitable land[/underline].
For the Idea of [person]person_266|Buffon[/person] that the
carbonaceous matter might have been washed
down by rivers and burried in the bottom
of the sea will not coincide with
certain simple facts.-

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00054|dnp17b52pp|94919274[/page]
In [deletion]the[/deletion] Coal and in the strata above
and below Coal are found perfect impressions
of the thinnest and most delicate [underline]vegetable[/underline]
[underline]leaves[/underline] and such substances so easy of
[underline]decomposition[/underline] if derived from the land
[underline]by rivers[/underline] must necessarily have been
destroyed by the action of Air and water
[underline]long before[/underline] they could have reached the
depth [underline]of the ocean[/underline] -
There are no distinct appearances which
demonstrate a very slow and gradual
deposition of the secondary [underline]strata[/underline];
but there are many which shew that
at least in some cases the effect of their

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00055|dnp17b53pp|94919275[/page]
formation must have been sudden and
[underline]rapid[/underline] -
Fishes the organized matter of which so
easily consumes have left their impressions
embedded in the hardest [underline]Rocks[/underline]. and these
impressions often exhibit the perfect and
unaltered form - [underline]Instance[/underline]
Other marine Animals likewise of a still
more delicate organization exhibit vestages
of their remains on undecomposed structure
Instance
The various appearances would seem to indicate
that these different beings had been suddenly
destroyed and suddenly enclosed in the strata
that contain them. --

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00056|dnp17b54pp|94919276[/page]
The various remains of the land animals
found in [chemical]chemical_088|[underline]Sand stone[/underline][/chemical] alternating with
[underline][chemical]chemical_184|Shell Limestone[/chemical][/underline] offers another indication of
the waters having covered the place of
their [underline]abode[/underline].-
And that these waters flowed in upon
a great extent of country and rushed over
the surface with [underline]considerable force[/underline] [deletion]seems[/deletion]
[underline]seems evident[/underline] from the transportation of
the remains of the Animals [underline]which are[/underline]
[underline]now only[/underline] found [underline]within the tropics,[/underline]
toward the poles -
The bones of the Rhinoceros and of
the Elephant have been found in

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00057|dnp17b55pp|94919277[/page]
[place]place_990|Siberia[/place] The tusks of the Elephant have
often been discovered in this country
I mentioned in the last lecture the
bones of the Crocodile found [underline]at Bath[/underline]
I have since been so fortunate as
to procure a drawing of them made
by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Rickharts from the kindness of
[person]person_1066|Sir Ge[superscript]o[/superscript] Paull.[/person]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Astronomical deductions seems to shew
that these appearances cannot result
from a change of climate arising from
a change of the inclination of the axes
of the Earth:
And when all the evidences are examined
and all the various appositions and

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00058|dnp17b56pp|94919278[/page]
agrements of facts discussed there seems
to be no period to which the production
and arrangement of the secondary Rocks
can be so well referred as to that of
the great Inundation of the waters upon
[underline]the Land[/underline] recorded both in sacred and
[underline]profane History[/underline] and of which so many
testimonies are preserved in Nature
and of which so many traditions have
been brought down from the Elder
Nations and from the most [underline]remote[/underline]
[underline]times[/underline] _
We perceive the effects of this
great catastrophe but the immediate

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00059|dnp17b57pp|94919279[/page]
[underline]material cause[/underline] of it can never be
distinctly [underline]develloped[/underline]
The Hypotheses of [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] extended by
[person]person_519|Whiston[/person] that it was produced by the attraction
of a comet upon the waters of the ocean
is perhaps the most plausible that has
[underline]been advanced[/underline] and when taken with limitation
the most adequate to the explanation of
the phaenomena with L
|_ Supposing that a large [underline]comet[/underline] approached
near the Earth having a power of attraction
sufficient to raise the tides to the utmost
height of our mountains and supposing
likewise that it was on its return from
the Sun and capable of communications

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00060|dnp17b58pp|94919280[/page]
heat to the waters; its influence there
is great reason to believe would be
fully adequate to produce the various
effects that have been observed and
to occasion those great and diversified
changes exhibited by the secondary
surface of the Globe. -
Assuming an elevation of temperature
of only 160 degrees where the Ocean
was elevated into the tides which in
it self would not be destructive to life
There is great reason to suppose that
the solvent agency of the water
would be sufficiently increased to

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00061|dnp17b59pp|94919281[/page]
enable it to contain with the different
Earths though the other parts of its
surface from its bad conducting power
might remain [underline]comparatively cold[/underline] .-
And from the mixture of the Heated
and the cold fluid different depositions
would occur and very different strata
be formed. -
The water of the ocean in rushing
over the different parts of the land
would necessarliy carry with them
their living inhabitants and many
of their substances forming their
bed. -

[page]62|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00062|dnp17b60pp|94919282[/page]
Where forests were overwhelmed layers
of Coal be [underline]produced[/underline] where calcareous
soils were torn up strata of chalk
would be formed and the sand
from the shores and from the depths
of the sea deposited at the same
time with dissolved [underline]earthy matter[/underline]
would produce the varied cemented
stones and Brecias.
The general effect of the action
of the Sea would be increased by
the rapid evaporation at the point
[underline]of attraction[/underline] and from the deposition

[page]63|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00063|dnp17b61pp|94919283[/page]
of torrents of water in the more
remote parts -
In the great series of changes rocks
that had been covered by the sea
would be laid bare many high lands
would necessarily be broken down
and levelled into plains the forms
of Mountains would be changed
and the productions of one country
carried into another by the rapid
impulse of the waves. - _|
It would be easy to offer still more
minute elucidations of the opinions
of [underline]L[/underline] but to multiply imaginary

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00064|dnp17b62pp|94919284[/page]
instances is perhaps to indulge too
much in the spirit of speculation
What ever may be the cause assigned
for this great event it must be
considered as one independent of the
common order of Nature, for in
the usual changes of the Sea and
The and the agencies of the land
nothing analogous occurs and it
must be referred to some power operating
in a novel manner in our Systems
As yet we are not perfectly able
to explain the existing oeconomy

[page]65|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00065|dnp17b63pp|94919285[/page]
of things and our Theories of past
changes must be more incomplete
the more these changes are remote
Placed as it were [underline]mere atoms[/underline] upon
[underline]a point of space[/underline] we perceive only
a few objects and a few of their
relations and to these we are [deletion]oblidged[/deletion]
obliged to refer in all our reasonings
whilst in the universal series of
occurances influences may have
acted and may be still acting of
which we have no conception
Yet [underline]nevertheless[/underline] it is proper that
we [underline]should reason[/underline] from [underline]the present[/underline]

[page]66|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00066|dnp17b64pp|94919286[/page]
concerning the past if we reason
with a calm understanding - -
The strength and the [deletion]corectness[/deletion]
correctness of the imagination can
only be preserved by exercise and
suppositions when they are made only
the amusements of the imagination
are rather useful than injurious
for they increase the activity
the mind the accustom it to rapid
combinations and they are only
dangerous when they are insulated
from facts when they are mere
distempered dreams or when they

[page]67|MS-DAVY-11702-000-00067|dnp17b65pp|94919287[/page]
are pertinaceously adhered to and
opposed to the conviction of truth .
The human mind deriving all
its ideas from the senses when in a
state of healthy [underline]exertion[/underline] sooner or
later uniformaly refers to facts and
when Hypotheses are used merely as
Instruments for comparing facts
and for ascertaining their minute
relations they promote in the highest
degree the efforts of inventive Genius
and tend to impress on [underline]the understanding[/underline]
the true and [deletion]unpervered[/deletion] unperverted
images of Nature .-
