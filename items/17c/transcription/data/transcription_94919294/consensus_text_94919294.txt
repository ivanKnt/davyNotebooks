in speaking of the effects of the
metals on the progress
of cultivation and repriments
expressly adopts the opinion
I have made a translation
of the passage.
Here; were the glittering veins of [deletion]metal[/deletion] [insertion]Treasure[/insertion] found
Where [deletion]All raised flames[/deletion] [insertion]active fire[/insertion] had scorched [insertion]the solid ground[/insertion]
And to the Eye disclosed the precious store
The [deletion]native [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion], [insertion]fluid metals[/insertion] & the [deletion]fluid[/deletion] [insertion]native[/insertion] ore
Such was [underline]the simple[/underline] & the happy cause
Whence the [underline]bold miners dangerous Art[/underline] arose
From one event & one ingenious thought
[deletion]the spirit of invention[/deletion]
Soon was the Spirit of invention caught.
And all the treasures different realms
produce
By powerful means applied to human
woe.
