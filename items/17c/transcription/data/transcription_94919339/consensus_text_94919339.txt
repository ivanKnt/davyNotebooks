satisfied with [underline]the idea[/underline]
that [deletion]the[/deletion] Veins &
the various minerals they
contain were created
at the same time with
the globe & that they
are [deletion]all[/deletion] consequently as
ancient [deletion]in[/deletion] as the mountains
in which they [insertion]are[/insertion] [deletion]were[/deletion] found.
