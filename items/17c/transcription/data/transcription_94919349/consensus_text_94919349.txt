[deletion]comp[/deletion] [underline]chrystalized compounds[/underline] on
the [underline]sides of the Vein[/underline] -
- In a geological point
of [deletion]few[/deletion] view [insertion]perhaps[/insertion] there are fewer
objections to this Hypothesis
than to the other, but
when chemical affinities
are considered inseperable
[underline]difficulties arise[/underline] -
We are acquainted with
no fluid capable of dissolving
the different [underline]metallic[/underline] ores
[underline]& the substances[/underline] found in Veins. -
& the idea of such a mixed
solution is incompatible with
the discovered laws of attraction
And [insertion]even[/insertion] supposing such a menstruum
no cause is assigned why it
should loose its active powers
