The progress of civilisation is
immediately connected with
the application of the metals
& it is not therefore surprising
that their discovery should
be mentioned in the first
historical & authentic documents
of Antiquity.
In the sacred writings of
Moses four metals are [deletion]described[/deletion] mentioned
Gold, Silver, [deletion]Brass[/deletion], & Iron; &
the descriptions in Exodus
prove that the Art of
working the metals had

[page]4|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00004|dnp17c02pp|94919290[/page]
attained a high degree of perfection
even in the earliest era
of the progress of [deletion]the[/deletion] power of
the Israelites. -
- the metallurgical arts
appear to have been [deletion]introduced[/deletion] brought
[deletion]from[/deletion] into Greece from the East;
and the veneration in which
the Introduction of them were
[deletion]com[/deletion] held is evident from all
testimonies - [deletion]both[/deletion] |_ in the writings
of the poets the Discoverers of
the metals are raised to the
rank of Deities; & [deletion]there can[/deletion] [insertion]the real Glory[/insertion]
[insertion]and utility of their inventions[/insertion] [deletion]be no doubt that the[/deletion]

[deletion]from these are the parts[/deletion]

[deletion]representations; of the [underline]inventors[/underline][/deletion]
In the [deletion]poems of[/deletion] Iliad & the

are [deletion]constantly[/deletion] [insertion]often[/insertion] mentioned: &
[chemical]chemical_008|iron[/chemical], brass, tin and [chemical]chemical_009|lead[/chemical] are
[insertion]likewise[/insertion] stated as being in common
use. [underline]Homer[/underline] gives a particular
account of the methods of
fusing, casting, polishing and
tempering the metals; but
makes no mention of their
ores, nor of the [deletion]places[/deletion] [insertion]positions[/insertion] in
which they are found, nor
of the means by which
they were procured. -

The first Greek Author who
speaks of the knowledge of
metallic veins is I believe
certainly Aristotle, but he
mentions them only vaguely
and in his account "of wonderful"
reports to which he often
appears himself to give no
credit.
the [deletion]Veins[/deletion] [insertion]mines[/insertion] of silver in the
mountains of Spain says
the philosopher are recorded
as having been discovered
by some shepherds , who
having set fire to certain
woods for the purpose of

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00007|dnp17c05pp|94919293[/page]
clearing the ground, found after
the combustion had ceased
a large fissure in the
surface containing an
ore of which the upper
part appeared as pure
silver ; And an Earthquake
happening soon after laid
bare the whole of the
vein which was [insertion]then[/insertion] [deletion]afterwards[/deletion]
worked to great advantage. -
[deletion]Lucretius[/deletion] Similar accounts
are given by various Roman
Authors who all make
the discovery of mines the
[underline]result of accident[/underline] - Lucretius

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00008|dnp17c06pp|94919294[/page]

metals on the progress

- The later Roman Writers though
they often mention the various
works in metals seem to
have been wholly unacquainted
with the common processes
of mining, there is indeed
every reason to beleive that
[deletion]the Republic was supplied[/deletion]

Diodorus the Sicilian who

[deletion]preceding the birth of Christ[/deletion]
in describing the productions
of different countries has
mentioned the metals as
generally raised & worked

particularly describes the
method of [underline]raising tin[/underline]
in Britain. [deletion]the passage is[/deletion]
[deletion]a very curious one[/deletion] - These Men

British Miners manufacture
their Tin by working the
grounds that produce it with
great Art, for though the
land is rocky, yet it has
soft veins of Earth running
through it in which the
treasure is found - The
miners extract it, melt it
purify it and shaping it
in molds into a cubical
figure send it to the
coast for exportation. -
- Strabo describes different
species of brass as found
in Phrygia and Pliny gives

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00012|dnp17c10pp|94919298[/page]
an account of the localities
of many of the metals
|_ but He seems to have
made no [deletion][underline]observations[/underline][/deletion] immediate
observations [underline]himself[/underline] upon the
subject & [insertion]appears[/insertion] often to have
followed very vague authority.
Thus he pretends to doubt
whether any Tin is found
in Britain and says that
it is brought from Portugal

times, not a single
atom of these substances
has been found. -

We know very little

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00017|dnp17c15pp|94919303[/page]

mentions the mineral impregnations
of [underline]water[/underline], [underline]issuing[/underline] out of mountains
as having often led to the
discovery of metallic ores.-
In this account [insertion]& in his general details[/insertion] He follows
philosophical views; but in
his History of the use
of the [underline]divining rod[/underline] He
seems to have [deletion]followed[/deletion] [insertion]been led away by[/insertion] the
popular superstitions of his
age.-
- A forked hazel rod
says the Author, when grasped
in such a manner that
a fork is in each hand
& held parallel to the
ground will be strongly attracted

used, will afford, [underline]certain[/underline]
[underline]indications[/underline] of them.
- The idea of the divining
Rod is mentioned with
great respect by most of
the ancient writes on mining
& Alonzo Bàrba in his
account of the Peruvian
mines makes a great
merit of having improved
it by using two rods one
placed cross ways on the
other instead of the
single fork. -
- Pryce in his Mineralogy
of Cornwall published as late as

deceived himself without

the [underline]different Geological [/underline]
[underline]Hypotheses[/underline]. -
- Agricola whose name
I have already [insertion]often[/insertion] mentioned
was the [underline]first observer[/underline]
who attempted to
give a full explanation
of the production of
Veins. - He supposes

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00049|dnp17c47pp|94919335[/page]
that the fissures in which
they are found were partly
formed at the time of
the production of the Rocks
themselves, & partly produced
afterwards by the agency
[underline]of water[/underline] - And he
conceives that they were
filled with stoney &
metallic matters by means
of the infiltration of
fluids saturated with
these different substances. -
- This opinion when
we consider the time in
which it was stated
[deletion]is[/deletion] may be regarded as singularly

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00050|dnp17c48pp|94919336[/page]
clear & [underline]very ingenious[/underline]. -
Agricola had seen in many
instances, metallic precipitations
produced from the mineral
impregnations in the waters
of [underline]different mines[/underline] & to
him it was yet a
[deletion]tr[/deletion] [underline]problem[/underline], how far the
solvent powers of water
might extend. He had
reasoned only from the
facts in his possession.
[deletion]& in the period in[/deletion]
[deletion]which he lived it had[/deletion]
[deletion]not been ascertained[/deletion]
[deletion]that the greater number[/deletion]
[deletion]of the metallic ores[/deletion]

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00051|dnp17c49pp|94919337[/page]
[deletion]were wholly insoluble in[/deletion]
[deletion]any fluid[/deletion]
|_ & so far he [underline]may be[/underline] regarded
as having reasoned like a
[underline]true Philosopher[/underline]. -
The Celebrated Beccher
(born at [underline]a time[/underline] when
the wonderful changes produced
in bodies by chemical
[deletion]changes[/deletion] [underline]agencies[/underline] were first
[underline]beginning to[/underline] be displayed)
concluded that the principal
operations of Nature might
be imitated by Artificial
means - [underline]He had[/underline] produced
a small quantity of [chemical]chemical_008|iron[/chemical]
from substances principally
volatile - And He concluded

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00052|dnp17c50pp|94919338[/page]
that the metallic veins were formed
[deletion]produced[/deletion] by [deletion]Volatile matter[/deletion] [insertion]vapours[/insertion]
which rose from the
interior of the earth; &
which by acting upon the
stoney bodies found in
Veins transmuted them into
[underline]different ores[/underline].
- Stahl the disciple
of Beccher has discussed
his opinion in a work
published in 1703; &
in collecting facts with
regard to it [deletion]He[/deletion] [insertion]soon[/insertion] found
that it could not be
reconciled to the appearances

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00053|dnp17c51pp|94919339[/page]
- This Philosopher as if
fatigued - with hypothesis
& perplexed with doubt [deletion]relinquished[/deletion]
gave up in his last work
all speculation upon the
subject and [deletion]all[/deletion] rested
satisfied with [underline]the idea[/underline]
that [deletion]the[/deletion] Veins &
the various minerals they
contain were created
at the same time with
the globe & that they
are [deletion]all[/deletion] consequently as
ancient [deletion]in[/deletion] as the mountains
in which they [insertion]are[/insertion] [deletion]were[/deletion] found.
- [person]person_470|Henkle of Freyburg[/person]
who flourished [deletion]soon after[/deletion] at
the same time [deletion]as[/deletion] [insertion]with[/insertion] Stahl

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00054|dnp17c52pp|94919340[/page]
supposes the different
Veins found in Rocks,
to have been filled
by [deletion]vaporous[/deletion] [insertion]metallic impregnations[/insertion] formed [deletion]by[/deletion] in
[insertion]consequence of[/insertion] fermentations continually
going on in the interior
of the [underline]different strata[/underline]
- His reasonings were
principally [insertion]founded[/insertion] in some partial
facts which He had
observed [deletion]to occur[/deletion] in
the decomposition of pyrites;
[deletion]&[/deletion]; they were adopted by
several of his disciples in
the saxon School of
Mines where they were

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00055|dnp17c53pp|94919341[/page]
defended with great earnestness
for several years.
- The idea of Henckel
is sufficiently fanciful
but it is [deletion]&[/deletion] perhaps
exceeded in singularity
by that of [person]person_305|Leman[/person]
who [deletion]sup at[/deletion] attempted
to shew in his work
on the beds of metals
published in 1753 at Berlin
"that all the different
[insertion]veins[/insertion] are merely branches arising
from one great trunk
hidden deep in the
bosom of [underline]the Earth[/underline] [deletion]from[/deletion]
And he supposes that

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00056|dnp17c54pp|94919342[/page]
the instances by which the
metals are formed have
been elevated in the different
branches in [underline]the same[/underline] manner.
as [deletion]fo[/deletion] the sap is raised
in plants, by the effects
of Heat & of light. -
- It would be an unprofitable
task to examine in detail
all the different vague ideas
[deletion]opinions[/deletion] which have
been formed [deletion]with regard[/deletion]
[deletion]to[/deletion] upon the subject &
which [deletion]have[/deletion] either [insertion]have not[/insertion] [deletion]not[/deletion]
been [deletion]attended to amongst[/deletion] [insertion]regarded by accurate[/insertion]

almost as soon as they

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00057|dnp17c55pp|94919343[/page]
[underline]were produced[/underline] - Amongst
the early opinions I have
selected only those of [underline]celebrated[/underline]
men; & all that [underline]they[/underline]
serve to prove perhaps is
that when celebrated men
amuse themselves with
dreaming, they [deletion]dream[/deletion] do it
almost to as little purpose
as [underline]common men[/underline]. -
-- |_The [underline]latest[/underline] hypotheses
that have been formed upon
the origin of Veins are
immediately connected with
[underline]the two systems of the[/underline]
[underline]Earth[/underline], [deletion]f[/deletion] different parts
of which have already
been discussed - I shall

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00058|dnp17c56pp|94919344[/page]
not take up your time by
entering into any minute examination
of the [insertion]comparative merits of the[/insertion] [deletion]Neptunian & P[/deletion] plutonic &
of the Neptunian [deletion]accounts[/deletion]
systems in accounting
for these phenomena; for a
very transient view will
be sufficient to shew
that both are in their
present states inadequate
to be explanation of
the facts. -
- Dr Hutton reasoning upon
the laws of specific gravity
supposes that [deletion]in the[/deletion]
[deletion]interior of the earth[/deletion], considerable
masses of metallic substances

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00059|dnp17c57pp|94919345[/page]
must exist in the interior
[underline]of the earth[/underline] & He supposes
that the same fire which
acting under pressure [deletion]has[/deletion]
[deletion]He conceives[/deletion] became the cause
of the consolidation of
the [underline]strata[/underline]; [deletion]to have[/deletion] [insertion]was the agent which[/insertion] brought
those metallic instances into
a state of fluidity; &
He attributes to [underline]the same[/underline]
[underline]force acting from[/underline] beneath,
[underline]the[/underline] [deletion]vents[/deletion] [insertion][underline]fissures[/underline][/insertion] formed in the
strata & the projection
of the [underline]ores[/underline] into those
[deletion]vents or[/deletion] fissures. -
- I shall again exhibit
the sketch which has been

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00060|dnp17c58pp|94919346[/page]
[underline]before shewn[/underline]; & it will
perhaps elucidate this [underline]particular[/underline]
[underline]instance[/underline] better even than the
general theory. -
- The idea of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton
is a very bold one - [underline]but[/underline]
[deletion]if it[/deletion] [underline]had it[/underline] been true
the metals ought to have
been [insertion]found[/insertion] generally diffused through
[underline]veins[/underline], or at least they
ought not to have been
limited to [deletion]a[/deletion] particular
strata - |_ And there
is a fatal [deletion]&[/deletion], a conclusive
objection, [deletion]to[/deletion] "Most of the
Veins in secondary countries
diminish in size as they

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00061|dnp17c59pp|94919347[/page]
are worked to a greater
depth & in some instances
through in a calcareous situation
they have been found to disappear
altogether. -
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Werner who upon this
occasion may be considered
as the representative of
the Neptunists - for M[superscript]r[/superscript]
de Luc has touched only
very transiently upon the
subject & M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan has only
lightly examined it in his
Geological essays - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Werner
I say in attempting to
account for the origin
of Veins has adopted an
opinion very similar to that

[page]62|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00062|dnp17c60pp|94919348[/page]
of Agricola, though extended
& adorned with a variety
of new instances. -
- The Saxon professor in
his work lately published [underline]upon[/underline]
[underline]Veins[/underline] after discussing [deletion]all[/deletion]
the various opinions endeavours
[underline]to shew[/underline]; that all Veins
are fissures formed [underline]after[/underline] the
Rock in which they are
found, & filled from
[underline]above[/underline]- And he asserts
that the different matters
they contain were dissolved
in the [underline]same fluid[/underline] from which
[deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]deposited[/insertion] the [deletion]different[/deletion] [insertion]primary & secondary[/insertion] strata
[deletion]were deposited[/deletion] & [insertion]that these substances were[/insertion] gradually
precipitated in different

[deletion]comp[/deletion] [underline]chrystalized compounds[/underline] on
the [underline]sides of the Vein[/underline] -
- In a geological point
of [deletion]few[/deletion] view [insertion]perhaps[/insertion] there are fewer
objections to this Hypothesis
than to the other, but
when chemical affinities
are considered insuperable
[underline]difficulties arise[/underline] -
We are acquainted with
no fluid capable of dissolving
the different [underline]metallic[/underline] ores
[underline]& the substances[/underline] found in Veins. -
& the idea of such a mixed
solution is incompatible with
the discovered laws of attraction
And [insertion]even[/insertion] supposing such a menstruum
no cause is assigned why it
should loose its active powers

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11703-000-00064|dnp17c62pp|94919350[/page]
& why after [deletion]holding in[/deletion] being
saturated with all the materials
of the surface of the globe, it
should become the comparatively
inactive [deletion][underline]element[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]substance[/insertion] [underline][deletion]of[/deletion] water[/underline]. -
|_ In [underline]stating [/underline] that I am
not [underline]satisfied[/underline] with [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Werner's[/underline]

I hope it [underline]will not[/underline] be conceived,
that I am passing a general

of the man who has devoted
twenty years of his life
to the study [underline]of minerology[/underline] -

[deletion]powers of reason[/deletion] by the mere
[underline]imagination[/underline] what [deletion]Nature[/deletion]
[deletion]has[/deletion] is concealed in Nature
from [underline]the senses[/underline]. -
There certainly [deletion]seem[/deletion] appears
to be no impossibility
in the discovery of a [underline]rational[/underline]
