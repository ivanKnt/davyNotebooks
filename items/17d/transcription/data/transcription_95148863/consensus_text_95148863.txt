I will take one recorded by
Dr Plott in the History of
Haffordshire - [deletion]The Author[/deletion]
[deletion]states[/deletion] A Man called Wilson
says the Author who lived
at Galand in Yorkshire having
piled up many cartloads of
pyrites in a Barn of his
own for some secret purpose
perhaps to extract the gold,
the Roof being faulty &
admitting rain water to
fall copiously in amongst them
they first began to smoke &
at last to take fire &
burn like red hot coals
so that the Town was
considerably disturbed & alarmed.
