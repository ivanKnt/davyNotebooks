Almost every house in the town
of Zante has a small lookout or
Belvidere on the roof, the resorts of the
Females who retire there to enjoy
the cool breeze, especially at
night. -
The beams are fastened & the
walls strengthened by iron clamps
which appearing externally as
dark lines, - give a peculiar
character to the architecture of
Zante, - & remind one
constantly of those convolutions
of nature from which the
town has suffered so much
& indeed is constantly suffering
more or less - a week rarely
passes without an earth quake.
