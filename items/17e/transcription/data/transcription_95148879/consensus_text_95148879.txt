[underline]Geology[/underline]
[underline]Volcanoes[/underline]
By far the greatest changes produced upon
the solid parts of the surface of the Globe in late
times [underline]have resulted[/underline] from the agencies of Volcanic
fires.
The causes and the [underline]effects[/underline] of Volcanoes are
subjects which cannot fail to excite curiosity
in all minds attached to the knowledge of
Nature
And their importance in Geological Theory
is great and distinct; for they afford the
only known facts of the agency [underline]of Heat[/underline]
