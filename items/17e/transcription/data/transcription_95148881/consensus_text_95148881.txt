to have been buried under Sicily.
The passage is one of the finest in [underline]the odes[/underline]
I shall read a few lines of it in wests translation
Now under sulpherous cumus sea bound shore
And vast Sicilia lies his shaggy breast
And snowy etna nurse of endless frost
The eternal prop of heaven for ever burst
Forth from whose nitrous caverns issuing rise
Pure liquid fountains of tempestuous fire
And veil in ruddy mists the noon day skies
Whilst cloaked in smoke the eddying flames
aspire.
