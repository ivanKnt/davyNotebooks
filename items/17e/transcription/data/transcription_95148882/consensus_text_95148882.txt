Amongst the greek historians Thucidides
mentions a great eruption of [underline]Etna[/underline] which
took place 476 years before Christ but he
gives no minute details.
Of the greek naturalist Aristotle in his
or concerning wonderful reports states that
had heard of fires which burnt by night and
issued out of the Earth in the Eolian Isles
and he was perfectly well acquainted with
the volcanoes of Sicily. -
The first eruption of Vesuvius certainly
known to have taken place was in the 79
year after the Christian era that eruption
in which the Elder Pliny lost his life.
