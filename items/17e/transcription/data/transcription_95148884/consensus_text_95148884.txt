- Sir W[superscript]m[/superscript] Hamilton was one of the first
persons who endeavoured to direct the observation
of men of [underline]science to the subject[/underline] -
His remarks upon Vesuvius published in ph[superscript]l[/superscript]
Tran[superscript]s[/superscript] - are well known and his work on the
Phligrean fields equally demonstrate the extent
of his knowledge and the refinement of his taste
- Since the period in which the first remarks
of our celebrated Countryman were made Known
to this world the path that He has marked out
has been pursued by many Philosophical
[underline]observations[/underline] -
Since that time Spallanzani has given
many valuable remarks on volcanoes in
his work entitled travels into the two Sicilies -
