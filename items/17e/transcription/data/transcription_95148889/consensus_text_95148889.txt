A friend who travelled into Sicily in the year
1803 has favoured me with a perusal of his
notes made upon Etna
They were written with no other [deletion]view[/deletion] view
than that of recalling to his memory scenes that
had strongly impressed him at the moment
I know that his descriptions are just and they
are so vivid that I am sure I need make no
apology for introducing them in illustration
of the subject. -
In speaking of the lower part of Etna He
says the ascent at first is not very difficult
Fields of exuberant fertility smile on [deletion]every[/deletion] every
side - Sasafarilla Cinnamon, [deletion]Sasaf[/deletion] Sassafras
The coffee plant and saffron all grow here
in abundance.
