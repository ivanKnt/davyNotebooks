It is certain that no part of the Island
can vie with the borders of Etna in verdure
in herbage and in the luxuriance of the
Grain.
The ground is agreeably diversified by
the number of small hills which at different
periods have formed an out let for the
subterranean fires but wwhich in the long
process of time have become covered with
vegetable mould and by their present
abundance atone for their ancient sterility
Trees so scarce in other parts of the
Island spring up here spontaneously and
attain a strength and vigour scarcely
to be seen elsewhere -
