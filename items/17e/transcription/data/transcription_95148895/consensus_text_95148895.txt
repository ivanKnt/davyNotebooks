by the immense blocks of lava on which
you are constantly obliged tread and which
never afford a secure footing.
We soon reached the spot whence issued
the late eruption only about two months
ago the aperture is very small -
Sulphureous [underline]steams issue from it[/underline] in [underline]great[/underline]
quantities and large masses of sulphur
appear in its neighborhood -
The ashes sand, scoria, and lava of
which the external past of the Crater
is composed have no consistence -
Hence you slip at every step but in slipping
you make a footing.
We had occasion to repose several times
but by degrees we attained the summit. -
