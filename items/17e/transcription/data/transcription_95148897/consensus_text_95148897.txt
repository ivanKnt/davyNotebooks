a blood red colour, we looked with long and anxious
expectancy for a favoured moment in which the
currents of vapour might dispappear or become less
dense so as to exhibit to us the interior of this
wonderful Laboratory of Nature : but looked in vain
We rolled down large stones with the hopes of
being able to estimate the depth from the time
of their descent.
The ground shook under us as often as they
struck against the side of the precipice
and the sounds became fainter and more
indistinct till they were gradually lost:
but we had no reason to suppose that we
heard the noise of their last fall. -
