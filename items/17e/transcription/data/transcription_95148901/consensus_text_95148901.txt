multiplied descreptions have been given of
the eruptions of volcanoes -
Philosophers have detailed them poets have
painted them but language must necessarily
fail when applied to such a purpose:
and not even the most perfect delineation
of the most perfect artist could do justice
to a combination of circumstances in which
feeling and hearing and sight are almost
equally concerned.
In which the Earth trembles -
In which the continued sound of thunder dwells
upon the ear, and in which the eye is
constantly dazzled by lightening flashing
above and by liquid fire streaming below -
