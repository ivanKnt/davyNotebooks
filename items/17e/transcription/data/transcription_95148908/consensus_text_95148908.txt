and in that gigantic mass of heavy clouds
flashes of forked lightning were [underline]constantly[/underline]
observed, so bright as to [underline]be visible[/underline] in the
[underline]day time.[/underline]
-At about six oClock in the morning
of the 16[superscript]th[/superscript] the lava had reached the sea
after having passed through and destroy[insertion]d[/insertion]
the greatest part of [underline]Torre del Greco[/underline]
