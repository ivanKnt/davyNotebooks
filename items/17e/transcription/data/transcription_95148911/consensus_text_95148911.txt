I saw -
And that which did [deletion]agu[/deletion] augment my
admiration was to see in the sea this matter
like rugged rocks burning in four fathoms
of water and two fathoms higher than
the waves -
Some parts liquid throwing off the stones
about them and causing a great and horrible
noise in the water and other parts becoming
solid making a firm foundation -
When it was night I went upon the Tower
and I could plainly see at ten miles distance
the fire [underline]descending[/underline] from the mountain
in a direct line; and the flame ascending
as high as the greatest steeple in your
Majestys Kingdom and throwing great stones
into the air -
