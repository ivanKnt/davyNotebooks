The agents concerned in those great
[underline]suberraneous changes[/underline] are hidden deep
in the bosom of the Earth and it is
impossible for us to contemplate them
in their [underline]active state.[/underline]
Even their effects can only be considered
at a distance and from the grandeur
and awful [underline]nature[/underline] of those [underline]effects[/underline] it
is ccarcely possible even for the most
philosophical and couragious mind to
examine with coolness and precision
Here analogy must be our principle
guide.
