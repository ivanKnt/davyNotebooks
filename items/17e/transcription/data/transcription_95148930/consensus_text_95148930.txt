The column of ascending smoke would
in consequence be inflamed the lava
would be poured forth and ignited stones
projected into the Air -
With every chemical change their is
likewise a change in the states of electricity
of bodies - And where such a series of
Alterations were produced the electrified
Vapours would necessarily give off their
fluid to the surrounding conducting surfaces
and the awful phaenomena of the
ignited exploded matter would be
rendered more sublime by lightnings and
thunders - //
