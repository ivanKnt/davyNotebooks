on next Thursday I shall resume the subject
and till that period I shall likewise defer
the consideration of the general effects of

the order of nature.

objections to the theory: but before it can
be [underline]fairly[/underline] judged of the minuter facts
belonging to it ought to be considered -
At the first view it will perhaps
appear too [underline]complex[/underline] -
