but in a system composed of
imperfect & perfect conductors;
there is [deletion]a similar analogy[/deletion]  law similar
as that prevailing with respect
to nonconductors, there may
be in the same system many
different states, Thus copper Zinc
Silver Tin & water; if [deletion]exchanged[/deletion] the
Zinc & the copper be brought in
contact with each other & water
& Tin & silver [deletion]Zinc[/deletion] Silver be brought
in contact with [deletion]all[/deletion] the same
portion of water & the Zinc &
silver be connected by an another
portion; there will be at least
4 different states - ie the Zinc will be +
the copper +. the [deletion]Zinc[/deletion] Tin + the silver -.
- In all cases in which positive
& negative electricity exist; there
is always such a coincidence
