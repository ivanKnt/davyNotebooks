difficult to say whether there
are not always more than two
states -.- When a rod of
sealing wax is rubbed at one
end, there is generally a
positive surface just above
the negative & another negative
above the positive & so on .-
- In the same system of perfect
conductors; as far as our
knowledge extends there seems
to be but two states - Thus
when Zinc & silver are in
contact the Zinc is positive
the Silver negative; & when
they are separated these [deletion]Zinc[/deletion]
states are rendered very obvious
