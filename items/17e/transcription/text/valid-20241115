Almost every house in the town
of Zante has a small lookout or
Belvidere on the roof, the resorts of the
Females who retire there to enjoy
the cool breeze, especially at
night. -
The beams are fastened & the
walls strengthened by iron clamps
which appearing externally as
dark lines, - give a peculiar
character to the architecture of
Zante, - & remind one
constantly of those convolutions
of nature from which the
town has suffered so much
& indeed is constantly suffering
more or less - a week rarely
passes without an earth quake.

[underline]Geology[/underline]
[underline]Volcanoes[/underline]
By far the greatest changes produced upon
the solid parts of the surface of the Globe in late
times [underline]have resulted[/underline] from the agencies of Volcanic
fires.
The causes and the [underline]effects[/underline] of Volcanoes are
subjects which cannot fail to excite curiosity
in all minds attached to the knowledge of
Nature
And their importance in Geological Theory
is great and distinct; for they afford the
only known facts of the agency [underline]of Heat[/underline]

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00008|dnp17e04pp|95148880[/page]
[underline]upon rocks which occur[/underline] in a great scale
and their relations to general Theory are
numerous and interesting. -
Volcanic fires have operated to a great extent
in all quarters of the Globe and they appear to
have occurred in the earliest ages of which we
have any authentic records -
[underline]Pindar[/underline] who lived nearly 500 years before
the [underline]Christian era[/underline] mentioned the [underline]eruptions of Etna[/underline]
and blending descriptions of this great natural
event with poetic fable He attributes the
effect to Typheas who after being defeated
[insertion]by Jupiter[/insertion] in the wars of the Gods at [deletion]by Jupiter[/deletion]
was supposed in the ancient mythology

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00009|dnp17e05pp|95148881[/page]
to have been buried under Sicily.
The passage is one of the finest in [underline]the odes[/underline]
I shall read a few lines of it in wests translation
Now under sulpherous cumus sea bound shore
And vast Sicilia lies his shaggy breast
And snowy etna nurse of endless frost
The eternal prop of heaven for ever burst
Forth from whose nitrous caverns issuing rise
Pure liquid fountains of tempestuous fire
And veil in ruddy mists the noon day skies
Whilst cloaked in smoke the eddying flames
aspire.

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00010|dnp17e06pp|95148882[/page]
Amongst the greek historians Thucidides
mentions a great eruption of [underline]Etna[/underline] which
took place 476 years before Christ but he
gives no minute details.
Of the greek naturalist Aristotle in his
or concerning wonderful reports states that
had heard of fires which burnt by night and
issued out of the Earth in the Eolian Isles
and he was perfectly well acquainted with
the volcanoes of Sicily. -
The first eruption of Vesuvius certainly
known to have taken place was in the 79
year after the Christian era that eruption
in which the Elder Pliny lost his life.

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00011|dnp17e07pp|95148883[/page]
But Diodorus Siculus and Strabo who were
both born before the death of Julius Caesar, were
of opinion that the mountain had burnt in
remote ages -
And that this must have been the case is
evident from the circumstances of [underline]Pompeia[/underline]
and [underline]Herculaneum[/underline] cities which were destroyed
in the first recorded [underline]eruption[/underline] being principa[insertion]lly[/insertion]
of Lava
The ancient Philosophers seems to have
paid very little attention to the natural
History of Volcanoes -
-And even amongst the moderns till
within the last forty years it has been
but little an object of study. -

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00012|dnp17e08pp|95148884[/page]
- Sir W[superscript]m[/superscript] Hamilton was one of the first
persons who endeavoured to direct the observation
of men of [underline]science to the subject[/underline] -
His remarks upon Vesuvius published in ph[superscript]l[/superscript]
Tran[superscript]s[/superscript] - are well known and his work on the
Phligrean fields equally demonstrate the extent
of his knowledge and the refinement of his taste
- Since the period in which the first remarks
of our celebrated Countryman were made Known
to this world the path that He has marked out
has been pursued by many Philosophical
[underline]observations[/underline] -
Since that time Spallanzani has given
many valuable remarks on volcanoes in
his work entitled travels into the two Sicilies -

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00013|dnp17e09pp|95148885[/page]
Breslac has added considerably to our geological
knowledge of them by his observations on
Campania
And Ferber and Dolomieu have both treated
with great acuteness the mineralogy of this
branch of Science
And if the most instructive of the works upon
the subject were to be selected it would
perhaps be the treatise of Dolomieu
sur les isles on the Lipari Islands
In this publication the most [underline]minute[/underline]
[underline]observations[/underline] may be found combined with
the most [underline]enlarged views[/underline]
And the Author has enlightened his
Philosophical researches by the assistance of
the most refined methods of Chemistry -

The forms of Volcanic mountains are
usually conical and those Rocks which
constitute their bases and which have not
been altered by fire differ very much
in their nature in different districts
The strata that appears at the [underline]foot[/underline] of
[underline]Vesuvius[/underline] are principlly [underline]shell Limestone[/underline]
The foundations of Etna are said to be
[underline]granite[/underline] and [underline]porphyry[/underline]; And these
[underline]substances[/underline] according to the reports of
Humboldt constitute the bases of the
great Volcanic chain of the Andes
[deletion]some [underline]of the eminences[/underline][/deletion]

[underline]some of the eminences[/underline] of [underline]which are elevated[/underline]
to the enormous height of four miles above
the [underline]level of the sea[/underline] -
The lower regions of volcanic mountains
even when the substratum of the soil is
lava are usually exceedingly fertile
and when a long continued quiet has prevailed
in [underline]the interior[/underline] vegetation is vigorous upon
all parts of the surface that are not raised
above the line of perpetual snow
In the account given of the Crater of
Vesuvius by Bracchni the interior of
mountain is described as in the form of
the inverted hollow of a cone covered
with luxuriant vegetation and abounding

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00016|dnp17e12pp|95148888[/page]
in majestic Trees- and in those places
where of late years the firy flood of
lava has boiled up He describes [underline]streams[/underline]
of [underline]pure water[/underline] as flowing down, and
cooling the air and affording nourishment
to the various tribes of plants that
adorn their banks.
[deletion]The height of Etna is ab[/deletion]
The height of Etna is about 10030 feet
and its circumference no than 40 miles and
yet so fertile are the soils in the lower part
of the mountain that the population is immense
and the number of the inhabitants of the
district is said to exceed 300,000

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00017|dnp17e13pp|95148889[/page]
A friend who travelled into Sicily in the year
1803 has favoured me with a perusal of his
notes made upon Etna
They were written with no other [deletion]view[/deletion] view
than that of recalling to his memory scenes that
had strongly impressed him at the moment
I know that his descriptions are just and they
are so vivid that I am sure I need make no
apology for introducing them in illustration
of the subject. -
In speaking of the lower part of Etna He
says the ascent at first is not very difficult
Fields of exuberant fertility smile on [deletion]every[/deletion] every
side - Sasafarilla Cinnamon, [deletion]Sasaf[/deletion] Sassafras
The coffee plant and saffron all grow here
in abundance.

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00018|dnp17e14pp|95148890[/page]
It is certain that no part of the Island
can vie with the borders of Etna in verdure
in herbage and in the luxuriance of the
Grain.
The ground is agreeably diversified by
the number of small hills which at different
periods have formed an out let for the
subterranean fires but wwhich in the long
process of time have become covered with
vegetable mould and by their present
abundance atone for their ancient sterility
Trees so scarce in other parts of the
Island spring up here spontaneously and
attain a strength and vigour scarcely
to be seen elsewhere -

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00019|dnp17e15pp|95148891[/page]
Amongst them peep on number of small
country Houses and villages the inhabitants
of which are well formed and healthy
Almost sinking under the heat of -
the freshness of the air which we here
experienced seemed a blessing sent from
heaven and every object that we beheld
appeared warmed with beauty and filled with
life -
The summits of Volcanic mountains
when elevated to any considerable height or
after having felt the effects of an eruption
present a striking contrast when examined
in the same vie w with the lower regions -

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00020|dnp17e16pp|95148892[/page]
Black and rugged and barren if not
covered with snow they bear the evidence
of having been changed by the force of
fire -
Formed of lava and strewed over with
[underline]pumice[/underline] stone or with volcanic dust
and [underline]sand[/underline] they present pictures of which
all the features are wild and sublime
and more impressive as the necessarily
call up in the mind the imagination
of the great natural events by which
they were formed. -
Most of the Craters or interior cones of the
great Volcanic mountains in [underline]their common[/underline]
[underline]states emit[/underline] smoke or some kind of
vapour and the lava of which they are

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00021|dnp17e17pp|95148893[/page]
composed is very irregular in its forms and
various in its constitution -
Breslac thus describes the crater of
Vesuvius as it appeared in 1800
The cone He says is cut in an inclined
frame having its direction from North East
to south west -
The circumference of the Crater is about
3000 feet -
All the bottom is a considerable plain from
which vapours of different degrees of density
almost constantly issue and the sides of it
offer the remains of the last lava that
issued from it in the eruption of 1754
Instance

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00022|dnp17e18pp|95148894[/page]
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Van Troil mentions very similar facts
with regard to the different Craters of [underline]Hecla[/underline]
in Iceland which having their exterior
covered with snow constantly emit from
their interior vapours insupportably hot
and exhibit walls of lava having the appearance
of black Glass -
The Friend who I have before quoted
spent some hours upon the summit of
Etna in the summer of 1803 I have
transcribed his descreption of this journey
to the edge of the great Crater,
Large tracts of snow He says lead to
the foot of it the ascent is prodigiously
steep and rendered the more difficult

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00023|dnp17e19pp|95148895[/page]
by the immense blocks of lava on which
you are constantly obliged tread and which
never afford a secure footing.
We soon reached the spot whence issued
the late eruption only about two months
ago the aperture is very small -
Sulphureous [underline]steams issue from it[/underline] in [underline]great[/underline]
quantities and large masses of sulphur
appear in its neighborhood -
The ashes sand, scoria, and lava of
which the external past of the Crater
is composed have no consistence -
Hence you slip at every step but in slipping
you make a footing.
We had occasion to repose several times
but by degrees we attained the summit. -

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00024|dnp17e20pp|95148896[/page]
The present Crater has been formed within the last
century chiefly by eight great eruptions
Its height according to Ferrara is 1800 feet the
circumference of its Case 1200 feet
The [deletion]vew[/deletion] view which presented it self from the
top of the Crater was perfectly new altogether different
from what I had expected -
As you have no object with which to compare the
hollow you can form no accurate judgment by
the eye of any of its dimensions. -
The ground of the border is so hot as to burn the
feet vapours issue from numerous orifices in it  -
And from the huge abyss itself arise volumes of
thick smoke which darken the face of heaven
and the colour of which is constantly varying -
The sun seen through this smoke sometimes
appears perfectly white and sometimes of

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00025|dnp17e21pp|95148897[/page]
a blood red colour, we looked with long and anxious
expectancy for a favoured moment in which the
currents of vapour might dispappear or become less
dense so as to exhibit to us the interior of this
wonderful Laboratory of Nature : but looked in vain
We rolled down large stones with the hopes of
being able to estimate the depth from the time
of their descent.
The ground shook under us as often as they
struck against the side of the precipice
and the sounds became fainter and more
indistinct till they were gradually lost:
but we had no reason to suppose that we
heard the noise of their last fall. -

[underline]Spalanzoni[/underline] as He himself relates was more
fortunate as to the circumstances under which
He beheld the Crater in Sep[superscript]r[/superscript] 1788 -
and unless He was much decieved He saw the
very lowest part of the aperture
I sat down says this Author near the
edge of the Crater and remained there two
hours I viewed with astonishment the
configuration of the border the internal
sides the form of the immense cavern. its
bottom an [underline]aperture which appeared[/underline] [deletion]like[/deletion]
the melted matter which boiled within and
the smoke that ascended from it the whole
of this stupendous was distinctly displayed

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00027|dnp17e23pp|95148899[/page]
before me; and I shall now proceed to give
some descrepcion of it though it will only be
possible to [deletion]give[/deletion] [insertion]present[/insertion] the read[deletion]er[/deletion] with a very feeble
image of a most grand and astonishing sight
The upper edges of the Crater are about a
mile and half in circumference -
the sides are composed [underline]of rugged[/underline] pieces of
lava [underline]form a speices of funnel[/underline]
and abound with concretions of Sal ammonia
The bottom is a horizontal plane about
two thirds of a mile round -
In this plane a circular aperture [underline]was[/underline]
[underline]visible[/underline] from which issued a large column
of smoke and when this smoke was impelled
to the side opposite to that on which I was
I can affirm that I perceived very distinctly

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00028|dnp17e24pp|95148900[/page]
a liquid ignited matter which continually
indulated [deletion]and[/deletion] boiled and rose and fell without
spreading over the bottom and this certainly
was the melted lava which had risen to that
aperture from the bottom of the Etnean Gulf
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[underline]The general aspect[/underline] of a Volcanic district
even in its most quiet state must be highly
impressive but when the subterranean fines
are displayed in their full [deletion]energy[/deletion] energy
when they burst forth from the interior
of the earth desolating and destroying
then the effect must be beyond all
all comparison the most awful and
the most sublime of the phaenomena
belonging to our Globe

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00029|dnp17e25pp|95148901[/page]
multiplied descreptions have been given of
the eruptions of volcanoes -
Philosophers have detailed them poets have
painted them but language must necessarily
fail when applied to such a purpose:
and not even the most perfect delineation
of the most perfect artist could do justice
to a combination of circumstances in which
feeling and hearing and sight are almost
equally concerned.
In which the Earth trembles -
In which the continued sound of thunder dwells
upon the ear, and in which the eye is
constantly dazzled by lightening flashing
above and by liquid fire streaming below -

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00030|dnp17e26pp|95148902[/page]
From the most accurate account it appears
That before any great eruption takes place
the mountain for a considerable [insertion]time[/insertion] is more than
[insertion]usually[/insertion] tranquil and one of the most common
indication of the approach of the event
is a great stillness in the air slight
tremblings of the earth and a drying
up of the streams in the [underline]vicinity[/underline]
A voilent earthquake often accompanies
the first great appearance of smoke and flame
and the mountain is often in combustion
for many days before any lava appears
At other times however in cases when
great explosions have taken place, the

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00031|dnp17e27pp|95148903[/page]
lava is thrown out at the same time
with the smoke and flame: and this
happened in the eruption of Vesuvius in
1794 one of the greatest recorded.
The general progress and extensive [deletion]evern[/deletion]
effects of this event were minutely [underline]observed[/underline]
and have been accurately detailed by Sir
W[superscript]m[/superscript] Hamilton - And I trust that an abstract
of a few of the [underline]most remarkable[/underline] particularr
taken from his paper published in the
Ph[superscript]s[/superscript]: Tran: for 1794 [underline]will not be[/underline] found tedious
[underline]They[/underline] immediately belong to the subject
of the lecture and will offer some curious
elucidations of Theory. -

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00032|dnp17e28pp|95148904[/page]
The mountain says the illustrious [deletion]Auther[/deletion]
observer had been remarkably quiet for
seven months nor did the usual smoke
issue from the Crater; but at times
it emitted clouds that floated in the air
in the shape of little Trees -
It was remarked that for some days
preceeding the eruption a thick vapour
was seen to surround the mountain
about a quarter of a mile beneath its
crater and the sun and moon had
an unusual reddish [deletion]colour[/deletion] cast. -
[deletion]The water of the great fountain and of the other[/deletion]
[deletion]to in the vicinity of Torre del Greco began[/deletion]
[deletion]to decrease[/deletion]

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00033|dnp17e29pp|95148905[/page]
The water at the great fountain of Torre del Greco
and of the other springs in the vicinity began
to decrease some days before the eruption. -
On the 12 of June there was a violent fall of
rain and soon after the inhabitants of Reseria
situated directly over the ancient Town of
Herculaneum were sensible of a rumbling
subterraneous noise - and about 11 oClock
at night a voilent shock of an earthquake
was felt at Naples.
On the fifteenth of June soon after 10 oClock
at night an other shock occured: but not so
voilent as that of the 12th.
And at the same moment a fountain of
bright fire attended with a very black
smoke and a loud repost was seen to

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00034|dnp17e30pp|95148906[/page]
issue and rise to a great height from
about the middle of the Cone of Vesuvius
and soon after another of the same
kind broke out at a little distance lower
down and both the openings immediately
poured forth lava -
Fresh fountains of liquid fire succeeded
each other hastily and in the space of
a mile and half fifteen of them might
be numbered, and others most probably
were hidden by the smoke.
It is impossible that any description
can give an idea of this firy scene
or of the [deletion]horid[/deletion] horrid [insertion]noises[/insertion] that attended
this great operation of nature -

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00035|dnp17e31pp|95148907[/page]
It was a mixture of the loudest thunder with
incessant [underline]reports[/underline] like these from a numerous
heavy artillery and accompanied by a
continual hollow murmur like that of
the rearing of the ocean during a voilent
storm -
There was an intermission at about 2 in
the morning of the 16. but at 4 the Crater
again shewed signs of a new action -
And lava issued from a new opening on
the other side of the mountain facing [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion
ottaiano and in a short time had passed over
three [underline]miles of Ground[/underline] and overwhelmed and
burnt a [underline]considerable Wood -[/underline]

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00036|dnp17e32pp|95148908[/page]
The upper part of Vesuvius was again
soon involved in clouds and darkness: and
so it remained for several days.
but above these clouds fresh columns of
smoke were continually rising till the whole
mass had the form of a fine tree stretching
to an [underline]enormous height[/underline] in the Atmosphere
and in that gigantic mass of heavy clouds
flashes of forked lightning were [underline]constantly[/underline]
observed, so bright as to [underline]be visible[/underline] in the
[underline]day time.[/underline]
-At about six oClock in the morning
of the 16[superscript]th[/superscript] the lava had reached the sea
after having passed through and destroy[insertion]d[/insertion]
the greatest part of [underline]Torre del Greco[/underline]

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00037|dnp17e33pp|95148909[/page]
It meet the waves with a hissing noise and
with loud explosions and continued [deletion]and[/deletion]
some time to flow beneath them.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Some of the eruptions of Etna have been upon
a scale still greater than even this of Vesuvius
In the eruption of 1669 the effects were the most
tremendous that have been noticed in any
age [deletion]on[/deletion] or in any country.
These effects have been minutely described
in a letter from [deletion]Lord Whin[/deletion] Lord Winchelsea
to Charles the Second -
His Lordship was an eye witness of the event
and has related it with much strength of coloring
and liveliness of description which even
the quaintness [deletion]of[/deletion] and ambiguity of his
stile cannot obscure -

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00038|dnp17e34pp|95148910[/page]
I shall make no apology for extracting
a few sentences from the Work -
I accepted (says the Auther) the invitation
of the Bishop of Catania to stay a day with
him so that I might be the better able to
inform your Majesty of the extraordinary
fire which comes from [underline]Mount Etna 15 miles[/underline]
distant from that City, which from the
horridness of its aspect for the vast quantity
thereof (for it is 15 miles in length and 7
in breadth) for its monstrous devastation
and quick progress may be terme an
inundation of fire a flood of fire and
glowing stones burning with such rage
as to advance into the sea 600 yards
and that to a mile in breadth which

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00039|dnp17e35pp|95148911[/page]
I saw -
And that which did [deletion]agu[/deletion] augment my
admiration was to see in the sea this matter
like rugged rocks burning in four fathoms
of water and two fathoms higher than
the waves -
Some parts liquid throwing off the stones
about them and causing a great and horrible
noise in the water and other parts becoming
solid making a firm foundation -
When it was night I went upon the Tower
and I could plainly see at ten miles distance
the fire [underline]descending[/underline] from the mountain
in a direct line; and the flame ascending
as high as the greatest steeple in your
Majestys Kingdom and throwing great stones
into the air -

[page]40|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00040|dnp17e36pp|95148912[/page]
And I could discern the rivers of fire
flowing down from the mountain of
a bright red colour bearing upon it
great stones of a paler red -
I assure your Majesty no pen can
express how terrible it was nor could all
the Art or industry in the world have
quenched it or diverted its course.
In forty days time it had destroyed the
habitations of 27.000 persons made two
hills of a thousand paces high each
of 20 000 persons that did inhabit Catania
3000 only did remain -

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00041|dnp17e37pp|95148913[/page]
[deletion]The fire in its progress towards Catania[/deletion]
The fire in its progress, towards Catania
meet with a lake of 4 miles in compass and
it was not satisfied by filling it up though
it was four fathoms deep but it has made
a mountain of it
All the accounts that have been published
of eruptions in other parts of the world agree
in their general features, and from the
similarity of the[deletion]ir[/deletion] effects of [underline]Volcanic[/underline] fires
a strong conclusion may be formed concerning
the similarity of their causes. -
On this subject however a number of
difficulties [underline]oppose[/underline] themselves [underline]to our reasoning[/underline]

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00042|dnp17e38pp|95148914[/page]
The agents concerned in those great
[underline]suberraneous changes[/underline] are hidden deep
in the bosom of the Earth and it is
impossible for us to contemplate them
in their [underline]active state.[/underline]
Even their effects can only be considered
at a distance and from the grandeur
and awful [underline]nature[/underline] of those [underline]effects[/underline] it
is ccarcely possible even for the most
philosophical and couragious mind to
examine with coolness and precision
Here analogy must be our principle
guide.

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00043|dnp17e39pp|95148915[/page]
Analogy investigated with caution and
assisted by accurate experiment -
Many enquirers into nature in attempting
to account for volcanoes have [underline]supposed[/underline]
[underline]that[/underline] a permanent central fire occupying
the interior of the Earth is the universal
cause of igneous eruptions -
This notion is one which it requires
little depth of research to adopt and but
little acuteness of understanding fully to refute.
Heat in all its states is capable of being
communicated from body to body.
And if a permanent fire had been
acting for ages upon the interior of
the crust of the Globe its effects

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00044|dnp17e40pp|95148916[/page]
must long ago have been perceived
upon the whole [underline]of that surface[/underline] which
would have exhibited not a few [deletion]evident[/deletion]
widely scattered Volcanoes but one
ignited and glowing mass -
An opinion infinitely [underline]more probable[/underline] is
that Volcanic fires are the result of chemical
changes of the intimate agencies of Bodies
of inflamable matters producing voilent
fermentations within the solid strata
|_ Lemery in 1670 was the first person who
brought forward this Theory und[insertion]er[/insertion] any precise
form and He founded it upon an
experiment of his own invention

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00045|dnp17e41pp|95148917[/page]
He buried two parts of wetted sulphur [underline]and one of[/underline]
Iron beneath the ground and a few hours
they fermented heated and flame arose from
the surface [underline]with[/underline] slight explosions -
Sulphur Lemery knew was of the common
products of all Volcanoes and He knew that
Iron abounded in the materials thrown out by
them -
His hypothesis was immediately pursued and
these two agents appeared to him adequate for
the explanation of the effects -
He had not himself been [underline]a traveller[/underline] into
Volcanic countries and in his time all the
observations made were [underline]superficial[/underline], transient
and inadequate

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00046|dnp17e42pp|95148918[/page]
It is not the defect of his genius therefore
if his theory be insufficient to explain
[underline]the phaenomena[/underline] it is the defect of the
knowledge of his [underline]Age.[/underline] -
The late researches in experimental
Science have shewn that Iron cannot be
combined with Sulphur in the state in
which it is commonly found in metallic
veins or in mines or in Volcanic Countries
and therefore no distinct conclusion can be
formed from the [underline]artificial process[/underline] on
[underline]the paste of Iron and sulphur[/underline] with
regard to the real cause of subterraneous
fires _|_|

[page]47|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00047|dnp17e43pp|95148919[/page]
Since the progress of the great discoveries in
[deletion]pneaumatic[/deletion] pneumatic chemistry many
have been formed having for their foundation
the original principal of the depesidance
of Volcanic effects upon chemical action
but few of them have been produced
by enlightened experimentalist -
The most sagacious of the Chemists of Europe
hitherto have attended more to Art than to
Nature.
of the great changes produced in their
experiments they have principally directed
their researches to minute processes for [deletion]chang[/deletion]
changing the forms of matter and for
supplying the various substances belonging

[page]48|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00048|dnp17e44pp|95148920[/page]
to the Earth to the uses and comforts of man
and occupied with those truly interesting
objects they have as yet attended to
the [underline]natural operations[/underline] of [underline]the Globe[/underline]
and to the changes that took place above
and below the [underline]surface[/underline] -
These departments of the science
however offer whenever they shall be
cultivated with ardour rich harvests
of discovery:
and even in the present infant state
of the enquiry the few truths that
have been ascertained with regard to
them have principally resulted from Chemical

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00049|dnp17e45pp|95148921[/page]
investigation.
The [underline]chief materials[/underline] active in Volcanic
eruptions must be newly combined during
the time of their operation and such of
them as are thrown out from the mountain
altered by the agency of the Air -
We can however reason only upon those
substances that are actually discovered and
though the facts known with regard to them
are scanty yet they the will afford us
very good foundations for theoretical
discussion.
The only known substance found in the
bosom of our mountain which is capable of
spontaneous inflamation from the effect
of common Natural agents [underline]is pyrites[/underline]

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00050|dnp17e46pp|95148922[/page]
And this body is one of the most generally
diffused in nature.
It is found in almost all rocks it forms
veins and often occurs in considerable masses.
Now the mere agency of water is sufficient
to produce such a fermentation in loose
masses of pyrites as to [underline]occasion their[/underline]
[underline]ignition[/underline]
of this truth there are numerous instances
I will take one recorded by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Platt in
the history of Harffordshire -
A Man called wilson says the Auther who
lived at Ealand in Yorkshire having
piled up many cart loads of pyrites

[page]51|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00051|dnp17e47pp|95148923[/page]
in a Barn of his own for some secret purpose
perhaps to extract the Gold -
The roof being faulty and admitting rain
water to fall copiously in amongst them
they first began to smoke and at last to
take fire and burn like red hot coals
so that the Town was considerably disturbed
and alarmed.
During the fermentation of pyrites with [underline]water[/underline]
sulphur is [underline]evolved[/underline] and the same species of
inflamable air which is given out [deletion]from[/deletion]
in the steams of Volcanoes.
but there are other products of [underline]eruption[/underline] which
cannot be generated merely from such a [deletion]caue[/deletion]
cause -

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00052|dnp17e48pp|95148924[/page]
The only operation by fire which can take
place in a large scale and in which
[underline]Sal Ammoniac[/underline] and Bitumen and fixed Air
or Carbonic Acid all of which are common
Volcanic products can be evolved is in the
[underline]distillation[/underline]
- To those persons who have not been accustomed
to consider the general series of chemical
phaenomena this idea may seem to need
experimental proof. It would be easy to
offer many but I shall content my self with one
Included in the top of this model there
[underline]is a mixture[/underline] of [underline]pyrites and coal[/underline] with a
little oxymuriate of Potash a substance
that will speedily supply to the [underline]pyrite[/underline]

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00053|dnp17e49pp|95148925[/page]
oxygene the principle necessary to its [underline]inflamation[/underline]
which water would only supply slowly
when I touch the mixture with a little
sulphuric Acid it will heat crackle and
emit smoke -
This must not be considered as an imitation
of a [underline]volcanic fire[/underline] for then it would be
ridiculous, but as an illustration of the concealed
active power of matter and I shall
have occasion to offer more illustrations
of the same kind in the next Lecture.

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00054|dnp17e50pp|95148926[/page]
And if we can concieve that the principle
agents in the [underline]exicitation[/underline] and preservation
of Volcanic fires [underline]are pyrites and pit coal[/underline]
acted on by water and Air all the
appearances would admit of an easy
explanation. -
// Sir Wm Hamilton has often remarked
that in common seasons Vesuvius throws
out most smoke and ashes when the
tides are high and the wind blowing
towards the shore which seems to imply
some subterraneous communication
between the interior of the Volanic

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00055|dnp17e51pp|95148927[/page]
crater and the sea -
The drying up of rivers and springs
likewise before great eruptions [deletion]seem[/deletion] to [insertion]affords another[/insertion]
[deletion]indicate that the water has some[/deletion] [insertion]fact in favor of this agency[/insertion]
[deletion]share in the effect.[/deletion]
[deletion]Their[/deletion] [insertion]Now[/insertion] assuming that immense masses of
pyrites existed in Volcanic mountains
diffused through beds of coal and in contact
with limestone Basalt and other rocks and
supposing that they were acted on by water
flowing in upon them from some new
orifice evidentally made
the first effect would be a production
of heat and [underline]this head not being[/underline]
carried off by any current Air

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00056|dnp17e52pp|95148928[/page]
would constantly accumulate and increase
the general series of changes -
The elastic fluid evolved becoming of a
high timperature would in consequence of
its expansive power make strong efforts to
escape by acting upon the incumbent
strata and would produce trembling and
agitations in the surface -
In cases in which a crater already existed
[underline]it would be[/underline] discharged throw it in [underline]great[/underline]
[underline]explosions[/underline] and would carry with it aqueous
vapour and bituminous and sulphureous
smoke.

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00057|dnp17e53pp|95148929[/page]
As the elastic fluid would be unequally
discharged common Air would be occasionally
pressed in to supply its place.
and a current would be established capable
of inflaming the combustible matters even in
the most profound parts of the mountain
with this effect the phaenomena of ignition
would begin
The sulphur coal and bitumen in combustion
would tend to fuse the compound stones in
contact with them - Carbonic Acid gas would
be produced and this and the other
elastic vapours would necessarily tend to
elevate portions of the melted mass into the
upper part of the crater.

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00058|dnp17e54pp|95148930[/page]
The column of ascending smoke would
in consequence be inflamed the lava
would be poured forth and ignited stones
projected into the Air -
With every chemical change their is
likewise a change in the states of electricity
of bodies - And where such a series of
Alterations were produced the electrified
Vapours would necessarily give off their
fluid to the surrounding conducting surfaces
and the awful phaenomena of the
ignited exploded matter would be
rendered more sublime by lightnings and
thunders - //

I venture to give this theory as an imperfect
sketch at present there is no time for a full
discussion of it.
on next Thursday I shall resume the subject
and till that period I shall likewise defer
the consideration of the general effects of
[deletion]Earthquakes[/deletion] Earthquakes and volcanoes in
the order of nature.
I already anticipate a number of [deletion]objections[/deletion]
objections to the theory: but before it can
be [underline]fairly[/underline] judged of the minuter facts
belonging to it ought to be considered -
At the first view it will perhaps
appear too [underline]complex[/underline] -

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00060|dnp17e56pp|95148932[/page]
Accustomed constantly to look for simplicity
in Nature the mind can scarcely bring
it self to believe that one great
Phaenomena can be produced by
a combination of minute causes
Yet this as will be shewn often
happens in the common and general
series of Natural events. -
Powers that having been operating
silently and unperceived for ages
sometimes produce their ultimate
effects in moments the most diversified
of the properties of bodies are often

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00061|dnp17e57pp|95148933[/page]
called into activity for one end
And though the [underline]Laws[/underline] that govern
the material world are few and simple
the agency that they direct are many
and complicated and as various as
the[deletion]ir[/deletion] external appearances they
[underline]Produce[/underline] -

no spark, no striking distance; but
[deletion]the[/deletion] if the surfaces are small there

- In air the discharge takes place
through a considerable distance & this
probably depends upon the mobility of
its parts; - those which are negative

producing Heat & light during the
production of the equilibrium. -

be [deletion]brought[/deletion] separated from the

[deletion]always[/deletion] in contact with it
will be negative: and it is probable
that in the air there are attractions
of negative & positive; - for if
a conductor be brought into the
neighborhood of a [deletion]conducter[/deletion] system
near that part electrified + it
will have its part opposite [deletion]+[/deletion]
-. its middle part will be 0.
& its extreme part +. - This
is usually called Electricity by

that they are perfectly capable
of balancing each other & of
producing a neutral state -
And if in a system the
part that is positive be
removed from the part that
is negative - It immediately
produces a corresponding negative
state in Ionic contiguous system.
[underline]or it becomes[/underline] positive &
negative in its own parts. -

but in a system composed of
imperfect & perfect conductors;
there is [deletion]a similar analogy[/deletion]  law similar

& Tin & silver [deletion]Zinc[/deletion] Silver be brought

portion of water & the Zinc &
silver be connected by an another
portion; there will be at least
4 different states - ie the Zinc will be +
the copper +. the [deletion]Zinc[/deletion] Tin + the silver -.
- In all cases in which positive
& negative electricity exist; there
is always such a coincidence

[page]67|MS-DAVY-11705-000-00067|dnp17e63pp|95148939[/page]
difficult to say whether there
are not always more than two
states -.- When a rod of
sealing wax is rubbed at one
end, there is generally a
positive surface just above
the negative & another negative
above the positive & so on .-
- In the same system of perfect
conductors; as far as our
knowledge extends there seems
to be but two states - Thus
when Zinc & silver are in
contact the Zinc is positive
the Silver negative; & when
they are separated these [deletion]Zinc[/deletion]
states are rendered very obvious

may be considered as analogous
to the two different states in
magnetised bodies. - - With

positive & negative relations there
are great differences. - . The same
body that is positive with one
substance will be often negative
with another. Thus Silk which
is made negative by the contact
of glass; becomes positive by
the contact of sealing wax;
& Tin which is negative by
the contact of Zinc, is positive
by the contact of Silver.

difference between different
