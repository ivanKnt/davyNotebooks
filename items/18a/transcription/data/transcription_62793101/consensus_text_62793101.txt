And that we may Know precisely the
composition of Air it is necessary that we
burn in it some inflamable body which
will absorb the whole of the [underline]oxygene[/underline] and

one part of Carbonic Acid 20. or 21 parts of
oxygene gas and 78 or 79 parts of [underline]Nitrogene[/underline]
or contain diffused through their pores a
certain quantity of Water.
