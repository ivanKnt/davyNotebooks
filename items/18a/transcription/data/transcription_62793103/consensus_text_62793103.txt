The fact of the existence of water in [underline]Air[/underline]
in the form of invisible vapour or of
dissolved moisture is shewn by many very
simple experiments
When pearlash or any very soluble
salt is exposed to the atmosphere it soon
increases in weight and become moist even in
the dryest weather and this is owing
to its [deletion]absr[/deletion] abstracting the invisible moisture
existing in [underline]the Air[/underline]. -
Likewise when we expose water in small
quantities upon a large surface it speedily
dissappears particularly in warm weather
and this depend upon its being diffused
through the Elastic fluid in contact with
it
