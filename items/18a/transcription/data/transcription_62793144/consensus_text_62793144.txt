This specimen of Soil is from a very
distant part of Britain.
The Chavalier Edeleranth was so good as
to bring it to me from Scotland Ormithan
in East Lothian and He informs me that
it produces excellent crops without manure
- I have made afew chemical experiments
upon it and I find that it differs
altogether in its composition from the
Somersetshire fertile soil
It contain in 100 parts only 11 p[superscript]r[/superscript]cent
of Calcareous matter and two of oxide
of Iron about 78 parts are Sand
and the remainder a finely divided
