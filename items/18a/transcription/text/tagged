[misc]misc_818|That the process of vegetation the agency of[line]manures and the effects of cultivation[/misc] may
be 'understood it is necessary that an acquaintan
be gained with the natural agents to
which plants are exposed during their
growth. -
The knowledge of the composition of the
Atmosphere and of soils is one of the most
important parts of the subject of the chemistry
of Agriculture and one that offers the
greater number of theoretical instruction of
practical application -

The presence of the Air is essential to the
health and life of plants and to the
operation of manures- the fertility of
the Land is immediately connected with
the influence of the surrounding Atm-
-osphere, and the History of its Constitution
and agencies is well worthy of a
particular examination
The appearances of the [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical]
that every where envellopes us are so
simple and uniform that in the first
examination we might suppose it to be
an elementary body and this opinion
was prevalant in all former times

[page]5|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00005|dnp18a03pp|62793091[/page]

Air was supposed to be undecomposable the
the most active and pure of natural agents
by the lately discovered method of chemical
Analysis we are however taught that it is
compound in its essence and that it
contains many substances essentially differen
from each other.
When [chemical]chemical_091|Quicklime[/chemical] is exposed to the
open Air a matter speedily forms upon its
[underline]surface[/underline] and a part of it is by degrees
precipitated to the bottom of the vessel
when the fluid is examined after some
days it is found no longer possessed
of the acrid taste communicated by the
[chemical]chemical_010|[underline]lime[/underline][/chemical]

[page]6|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00006|dnp18a04pp|62793092[/page]

The whole of the Earth will have been
deposited in a solid form and its weight
will have been considerably increased -
It is evident from this fact that
the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] in the water has combined
with something existing in the Atmosphir
and this is fixed Air or [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The existance of fixed Air or [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] in the Atmosphere is likewise shewn
[deletion]upon[/deletion] by its action upon soap [unclear]xxxx[/unclear]

[page]7|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00007|dnp18a05pp|62793093[/page]

other parts of the Atmosphere is very small
and it never exceeds the [deletion]100[/deletion] [insertion]1/800[/insertion] part of the
whole [underline]mass[/underline].
The gasses which compose the great
portion of the Air are very different in
their [underline]nature[/underline] One of them has been
already mentioned under the name of
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] and it is the substance that
supports [underline]combustion[/underline] and the other which
is incapable of supporting [underline]combustion[/underline] is
called not [underline]respirable Air[/underline] or [chemical]chemical_017|[underline]Nitrogene[/underline][/chemical]
[underline]gas[/underline]. -
When an inflamed taper or any
other burning body is introduced
into a close vessel filled with

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00008|dnp18a06pp|62793095[/page]
6
[underline][chemical]chemical_149|atmospherical air[/chemical][/underline] whether freed or not
from [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] its light gradually
diminishes the flame becomes smaller
and at last disappears altogether.
And after this effect has been
produced the qualities of the Air will
be found wholly altered.
It is no longer capable of supporting
Combustion and a small animal if
introduced into it would almost immedia
-tely expire -

[page]9|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00009|dnp18a07pp|62793097[/page]

Instance [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical].
In conducting this experiment with
perfect accuracy we find that water
is deposited upon the sides of the Vessel
and that the Air is diminished both
in volume and weight.
Hence it is evident that something has
been abstracted from it and this is
the principal essential to [underline]Combustion[/underline]
The [underline]pure[/underline] Air on [chemical]chemical_022|[underline]Oxygene[/underline][/chemical] and [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]as
there have been no transmission of
ponderable matter through the glass it
must have united it self to the
inflamable body to form new
[underline]products[/underline];

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00010|dnp18a08pp|62793099[/page]
8
The [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical] remaining which is
incapable of supporting the life of [underline]Animals[/underline]
or the flame of burning bodies is the
[chemical]chemical_017|[underline]Nitrogene[/underline][/chemical] And it is called so because it is
one of the Elements [underline]of nitrous Acid or[/underline]
[chemical]chemical_150|[underline]Aqua fortis[/underline][/chemical]
It is evident from the combustion of
[chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] that the [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical] in the Atmosphe[superscript]~[/superscript]
considerably exceeds the [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] in quantity
but this process is not the most accurate
for the Analysis as a little new ariform
substance is produced in it which requires
some time before it is dis[insertion]s[/insertion]olved by water

[page]11|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00011|dnp18a09pp|62793101[/page]
9
And that we may Know precisely the
composition of Air it is necessary that we
burn in it some inflamable body which
will absorb the whole of the [chemical]chemical_022|[underline]Oxygene[/underline][/chemical] and
form with it only solid matter such a
body is [chemical]chemical_151|[underline]Phosphorus[/underline][/chemical]
When [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] is burnt in Air in a
manner similar to [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] it is found
that the absorption is [deletion]one[/deletion] 1/5 which
coresponds to the [chemical]chemical_017|[underline]Nitrogene[/underline][/chemical]
[superscript]100[/superscript] parts in volume of Air Contain about
one part of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] 20. or 21 parts of
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] gas and 78 or 79 parts of [chemical]chemical_017|[underline]Nitrogene[/underline][/chemical]
or contain diffused through their pores a
certain quantity of Water.

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00012|dnp18a10pp|62793103[/page]

The fact of the existence of water in [underline]Air[/underline]
in the form of invisible vapour or of
dissolved moisture is shewn by many very
simple experiments
When [chemical]chemical_468|pearlash[/chemical] or any very soluble
salt is exposed to the atmosphere it soon
increases in weight and become moist even in
the dryest weather and this is owing
to its [deletion]absr[/deletion] abstracting the invisible moisture
existing in [underline]the Air[/underline]. -
Likewise when we expose water in small
quantities upon a large surface it speedily
dissappears particularly in warm weather
and this depend upon its being diffused
through the [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical] in contact with
it

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00013|dnp18a11pp|62793105[/page]
11
All the phenonena of evaporation depend
upon the power which water possesses of
being rendered elastic in the Air and
dew Rain and snow are occasioned by
its deposition which is generally owing
to a diminution of the Heat in the
upper strata of the Atmosphere as
moisture is much more diffusible through
warm than through Cold Air -
In [underline]the Hottest[/underline] weather of [underline]Summer[/underline]
[underline]and when[/underline] the Atmosphere is [underline]fully[/underline]
[underline]Saturated[/underline] with moisture in our
climates, according to the experiments
of de [otherwork]otherwork_310|Saussure[/otherwork] it never contains

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00014|dnp18a12pp|62793106[/page]
12
more than 1/20 of its weight of water
and in the coldest and dryest
weather never less than 1/60
Besides the permantley elastic parts of
Air which are found throughout the
whole of its extent the Atmosphere often
contains solid and fluid matter which
are raised from the surface of the
Earth and which remain for a short
time mechanically suspended in it and
which are carried down by rain and
dews -

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00015|dnp18a13pp|62793108[/page]
13
From C[deletion]c[/deletion]ities and Towns a considerable
quantity of coaly matter in smoke of [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical]
matter and of Animal effluvia are
continually carried by the winds and
they are sometimes immediately deposited
in the vicinity and are sometime
transported to the distance of many miles
And this circumstance it is necessary
to attend to in considering the influence
of the Atmosphere on vegetables in differin
situations. [deletion]and under different[/deletion]
[deletion]circumstances[/deletion] -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00016|dnp18a14pp|62793109[/page]

Certain vegetables are capable of growing
when their roots are immersed in pure
water and their leaves being exposed to
the free [underline]Atmosphere[/underline]
But in this [underline]case[/underline] according to the Exp[superscript][underline]mts[/underline][/superscript]
of M[superscript]r[/superscript] H[unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] they are never found in a
healthy state they are incapable of
producing healthy seeds.
In the natural process of [underline]Vegetation[/underline]
all plants are fixed by the different
fibres of their roots in the soil which
covers a very considerable proportion of the
[underline]Globe[/underline].
The Atmosphere is every where uniform
in its composition; but the soil is almost

[page]17|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00017|dnp18a15pp|62793111[/page]
15
infinitely diversified with regard to its
constituent [underline]parts[/underline].
leave off here
[Horizontal rule]
In the greater number of [underline]Cases[/underline] its
[underline]basis[/underline] is a certain mixture or Combination
of some of the primitive Earths and it
usually contains small quantities of [chemical]chemical_166|oxide[line]of iron[/chemical] [underline]of [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] bodies[/underline] and of vegetable
[underline]composing matter.[/underline]
When a portion of a Common fertile
soil freed from vegetable roots or fibres
and from stones [deletion]boiling water water[/deletion]
is diffused through boiling water for
a certain length of time if the water
be small in quantity it generally

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00018|dnp18a16pp|62793113[/page]
16
gains a slight degree of Colour and is
found to hold in solution a very small
quantity of vegetable matter and sometim
a little [chemical]chemical_167|saline[/chemical] substance.
The solid matter remaining
at the bottom of the Vessel in which
the Experiment is made is found to
consist of a very finely divided Earth
which is usually Clay or [chemical]chemical_112|Marle[/chemical] -
and of Earth is a more solid state
of aggregation which is [underline]Sand[/underline]

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00019|dnp18a17pp|62793114[/page]
17
The sand may be separated from the
Clay by washing through a sieve or by
agitating the vessel or by pouring off the
water containing the Clay diffused through
[underline]it[/underline] -
The [underline]sand[/underline] of [underline]a soil[/underline] is sometimes
[chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] and sometimes [chemical]chemical_081|[underline]calcareous[/underline][/chemical] when
[chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] it is insoluble in Acids,
when [chemical]chemical_081|[underline]calcareous[/underline][/chemical] it dissolves soon with
effervescence - .
The Clays in soils are very different
in their [underline]Composition[/underline] - they often
effervesce with acids and in this
case they contain mild Calcareous Earth
or [chemical]chemical_109|carbonate of Lime[/chemical]

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00020|dnp18a18pp|62793116[/page]
18
That part of them insoluble in cold acids
consists chiefly of two Earths [underline][chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical][/underline] or
the pure matter of Clay and [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] or the
earth of flints. -
And these substances may be separated
from each other by being long boiled in
diluted acid of vitrol or [chemical]chemical_037|Sulp[superscript]r[/superscript][/chemical] Acid
In this case the [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] is dissolved
with the acid a salt resembling common
alum and the [chemical]chemical_106|Flint[/chemical] remain untouched
and appears in the form of a white
[underline]powder[/underline]. -

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00021|dnp18a19pp|62793118[/page]
19
The vegetable decomposing [underline]matter[/underline] in [underline]soils[/underline] can
never be [deletion]obtained[/deletion] wholly obtained by
washing or [underline]boiling[/underline]. -
It exists in greatest abundance in black
moulds and in all soils approaching in
their nature to [underline]peat[/underline] and some idea may
be formed of its quantity;
[underline]Properties[/underline] in their [underline]pure state[/underline]
- [underline]One[/underline] principle use of the soil is to
recieve the roots and the [underline]plant[/underline] so as
to enable it to be exposed in the best
possible manner to the agency of air
and of moisture

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00022|dnp18a20pp|62793120[/page]
20
Timber trees and fruit trees are capable
of growing in most of our common
soils. -
Wheat Barley and the plants producing
farinaceous grain vegetate best in a [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
mixture of clay and sand in which
the clay does not exceed 1/3 of the
weight of soil. Instance
But Potatoes and Turnips require [underline]light[/underline]
soils and the Potatoe will flourish
in a land that contains nearly 5/6 -
of [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] sand.

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00023|dnp18a21pp|62793122[/page]
21
In this case there is greater room for the
expansion of its solid matter and the
farinaceous substance that it containes is
less coherent and more proper for the
purposes of food.
[underline]Instance - potatoe soil[/underline]
In [chemical]chemical_112|marles[/chemical] and Clays the Aluminous
Earth is the substance that produce their
toughness and tenacity and when
they are dried if they contain any
considerable proportion of this substance
they will adhere to the tongue
Soils which contain a large
proportion of Calcareous earth are

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00024|dnp18a22pp|62793124[/page]
22
often hard and compact but never tough
and the lightest and losest clayey soils
are those that are composed of a large
proportion of finely divided [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical]
matter.
There are some light clays in different
parts of [place]place_159|Brit[deletion]i[/deletion]ain[/place] that approach in their
nature to porcelain clay which is nearly
pure [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] and yet by cultivation
they are made capable of producing
grain,- Instance
Very compact and tenacious soils
often contain a number of small
stones in a decomposing state.

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00025|dnp18a23pp|62793126[/page]
23
and by those stones their texture is improved
and they are rendered more permeable
to the roots of Plants. -
Dead vegetable fibres besides their
operation as manure have another
effect in rendering the surface lighter
and by giving it a mechanical
constitution more permeable to the
Atmosphere and to Water -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The different substances in soils by their
more mechanical [underline]agency[/underline] promote vegetation
and are remotely subservient to the
growth of Plants -

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00026|dnp18a24pp|62793127[/page]
24
Their chemical agencies however are
not less important than their mechanic[insertion]al[/insertion]
ones though they have been much less
studied and still are less [underline]understood[/underline]
All the Earths found in soils are possessed
of a considerable power of [underline]absorbing water[/underline]
and [deletion]immediately[/deletion] in cases when water
is not immediately exposed to them in
its fluid form they are capable of
attracting it from the [underline]Air[/underline]. -
If a specimen of [underline]common soil[/underline] be
dried before the [underline]fire[/underline] and then exposed
to the air it will will be found to
increase in weight by combination

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00027|dnp18a25pp|62793128[/page]
25
with the invisible moisture which I have
already mentioned exists in the Atmosphere
If it be heated again it will diminish
in weight and closed vessels are
employed it is found that a certain
portion of pure water is given out
by it
of the primitive Earths [deletion]formed[/deletion]
found in soils [chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] is that which
has the strongest power of absorbing water
next to it we may class mild calcareous
Earth or Carbonate of [chemical]chemical_010|[underline]lime[/underline][/chemical] and last of
all [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] or pure [chemical]chemical_106|Flint[/chemical] -

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00028|dnp18a26pp|62793130[/page]
26
The soils most retentive of moisture are
the [chemical]chemical_112|marles[/chemical] and Clayes; but sandy soils
are comparatively dry and in incapable
of attracting any considerable portion
of Water from the [underline]Air[/underline]. -
In this climate the moisture deposited
from the Atmosphere in [underline]Rain[/underline] or [underline]Dew[/underline]
is that commonly retained by the [underline]soil[/underline]
and supplied in due proportions to
the roots of [underline]Plants[/underline];
But in warmer climates and even
in this Country in dry weather the
moisture essential to vegetation is

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00029|dnp18a27pp|62793131[/page]
27
partly attracted immediately from the
Air in which it was dissolved and
partly from the moisture subsoil or strata
beneath. -
[underline]Calcareous Earth[/underline] or [chemical]chemical_010|[underline]lime[/underline][/chemical] as we
have already seen has a strong attraction
for [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] or fixed Air.
[underline][chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical][/underline] is capable of combining
with it; but its union takes place with
a much weaker force.
[chemical]chemical_140|[underline]charcoal[/underline][/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_022|[underline]Oxygene[/underline][/chemical] as has been
already stated are amongst the principle
elements of vegetable matter and it
is extremely probable that the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical] of the Air

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00030|dnp18a28pp|62793132[/page]
28
becomes a part of the food of Vegetable
not only in its free and diffused state
but likewise in its state of [underline]union with[/underline]
[underline][chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical][/underline] and [chemical]chemical_010|[underline]lime[/underline][/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_058|[underline]Carbonic acid[/underline][/chemical] is absorbed by the
[chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical]; but it adheres to it with
an attraction exceedingly feeble.
The fertility of red and yellow
soils is well known. These soils contain
a considerable proportion of oxide of
Iron and it is extremely probable
that this substance is in some measure
subservient to vegetation in consequence

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00031|dnp18a29pp|62793134[/page]
29
of its power of combining with [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic[line]acid[/chemical].
It has however another distinct effect
upon soils that by its chemical action
upon them it preserves them in a Core
state of aggregation and prevents them
from remaining too close and tenacious.
The [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] in its common
state[deletion]s[/deletion] is continually tending to combine
with pure Air and in consequence of
this tendency even the most solid
stones that contain it are often
decomposed and brought into a
finely divided state.

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00032|dnp18a30pp|62793137[/page]
30
I have examined some of these soils in which
Iron exists; but which are not fertile. -
Such are the red [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] B[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of [place]place_160|Somersetshire[/place] and
the yellow sandy Soils of [place]place_161|Sussex[/place].
And I find that they consist of sandy [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical]
matter and are exceedingly loose in their texture
But the fertile Iron Land of [place]place_162|Devonshire[/place]
and [place]place_160|Somersetshire[/place] are loaded with Calcareous and
[insertion][deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] Aluminous Earths.
Soils extremely different in their Chemical
Composition are found possessed of the same
degree of fertility and their productive powers
as will be more fully stated hereafter are
influenced by Climate by the nature of the

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00033|dnp18a31pp|62793138[/page]
31
Subsoil and by their position and relation
to rivers and streams.
The Soils in general that require the smalest
quantity of manure contain certain proportions
of Calcareous and Aluminous Earths; and
either of them may be in considerable excess
This is a specimen of a soil from the
marsh in the lower part of [place]place_160|Somersetshire[/place]
and it is mentioned by [person]person_041|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Billingsley[/person]
in his survey of that County as [deletion]remarkable[/deletion]
extremely fertile and remarkable for producing
good crops of Wheat.
I made last year some experiments
upon a part of it. It appeared to

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00034|dnp18a32pp|62793141[/page]
32
contain only a small portion of Vegetable
matter and gave about 1/9 of Sand chiefly
[chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] and 8/9 of Clayey [chemical]chemical_112|Marle[/chemical] which
was composed chiefly of [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] and
[chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical].
The [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] is evident in it
when it is calcined. -
This soil as I have been informed
by [person]person_105|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Pool[/person] of Stowey who was so good
as to procure it for me requires no
manure and produces alternately excellent
crops of wheat and beans and
it is never overflowed

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00035|dnp18a33pp|62793144[/page]
33
This specimen of Soil is from a very
distant part of [place]place_159|Britain[/place].
The Chavalier Edeleranth was so good as
to bring it to me from [place]place_235|Scotland[/place] Ormithan
in [place]place_084|East Lothian[/place] and He informs me that
it produces excellent crops without manure
- I have made afew chemical experiments
upon it and I find that it differs
altogether in its composition from the
[place]place_160|Somersetshire[/place] fertile soil
It contain in 100 parts only 11 p[superscript]r[/superscript]cent
of Calcareous matter and two of [chemical]chemical_166|oxide[line]of iron[/chemical] about 78 parts are Sand
and the remainder a finely divided

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00036|dnp18a34pp|62793145[/page]
34
aluminous Clay with a little decomposing
vegetable matter. -
The solution by [deletion]muratic[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical]
produces a slight precipitate so that it
contains a small quantity of Phosphate of
[chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] and perhaps this substance contributes
to its fertility
The most perfect Lands are
undoubtedly such as attract the largest
quantity of nutritive matter from the
[underline]Atmosphere[/underline] that inexhaustible source
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] and of Water
But in all [underline]soils[/underline] in the common
states of Cultivation a larger or

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00037|dnp18a35pp|62793146[/page]
35
smaller portion of vegetable matter is
constantly deposited in consequence of the
decomposition of the [underline]Roots[/underline] and [underline]leaves[/underline]
the remains of different [underline]Crops[/underline]
This Vegetable matter is differently modifyed
in different soils and according as tis altered
by the attractions of the Earths or the
agency of the [underline]Atmosphere[/underline] it becomes more
or less proper for the nourishment of Plants
[chemical]chemical_111|silicious earth[/chemical] has little or no attraction
for any of the Principles of decomposing
vegetable substances., and Hence these
substances are soonest exhausted in
a soil containing Air

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11801-000-00038|dnp18a36pp|62793147[/page]
36
Excess of [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] as is shewn by common
experience and such soils are I believe
named by Farmers hungry soils.
[chemical]chemical_108|alumine[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] are capable of
entering into union with Colouring and
astringent matter, vegetable [underline]acids[/underline] and [underline]soils[/underline]
and they form with them for the most
part difficultly soluble compounds
In consequence of their affinities the
organizable matter is supplied only in
small quantities to the living plants
and it is effectual in its agency
and the ultimate processess of

combinations.
[misc]misc_192|Mucilage[/misc] whenever it exist in soils is
capable of being immediately dissolved
by water and as there is great
reason to believe it is absorbed by
plants pure and unaltered so as
to constitute a part of their Sap -
Woody fibre that it may become capable
of assimilation to the vegetable organs
requires the long continued action of
moisture and the [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] of the Air -

The Earths of a soil form a bed
in which all those changes so
necessary to Vegetable life take place
And these appear themselves in
certain cases to be taken up in small
quantities into the organs of plants.
I have already mentioned salicious
Earth exists in the grasses and

And calcareous and [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] are
found in al[deletion]l[/deletion]most all plants and there
is great reason to [deletion]believe[/deletion] suppose that
they are carried into the sap from
the soil, but the general manner
in which these dead substances are
modified and made subservient to
vegetation will be discussed in the
next lecture which is on the
nourishment and growth of
