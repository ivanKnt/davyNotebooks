When a [underline]seed[/underline] is placed in contact with moisture
at a temperature above 40 degrees, the eperdimis
or coat by which it is surrounded gradually
swells and becomes looser.
Its Cotyledons are enlarged in their dimensions
and elastic fluid is given out from them. -
In this state the seed is prepared for germinat[insertion]on[/insertion]
supplied with [underline]Heat[/underline] and with [underline]moisture[/underline] it
requires only [underline]Atmospherical Air[/underline] to enable
it to evolve its [underline]infant organs[/underline]
If a moistned seed be brought in contact with
a portion of the Atmosphere confined in a
proper vessel it is found [insertion]that[/insertion] at the time of
sprouting a certain quantity of pure Air
or of [underline]oxygene[/underline] is absorbed and that
a little fixd Air [chemical]Carbonic Acid[/chemical] is given
out by it 2
