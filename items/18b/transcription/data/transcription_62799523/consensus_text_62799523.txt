One of, the finest and fullest of the winter
grain of [deletion]last year[/deletion] [insertion]1804[/insertion]. The other of the spring

Oone hundred parts of the [underline]winter wheat[/underline]
gave 19 of Gluten
and, about 75 of Starch
The Spring Wheat
gave 24 of Gluten
and 68 or 9 of Starch
And [deletion]as I mentioned before[/deletion] Gluten is the
most nutritive part of the Corn so that if
it should be found that Spring wheat is
less liable to mildew than winter wheat
as Sir Joseph seems inclined to believe there
will be little disadvantage in the
cultivation of it
