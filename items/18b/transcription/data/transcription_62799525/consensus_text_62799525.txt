^ In mildewed [underline]wheat[/underline] the plumula &
radicle are in as perfect a
state as in [unclear]xxx[/unclear] wheat; but
the cotyledons contain much less
nourishment "- I found by analysis in
the mildewed wheat of 1804 only 13 parts
of gluten & 52 of starch & the insoluble &
[unclear]earthy[/unclear] matter amounted to 35. - There
would be much less [deletion][unclear]nourishment[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]food[/insertion] for
the Germ; - whether this would interfere
[insertion][unclear]materially[/unclear][/insertion] with the crop can only be determined
by experiment, it would certainly prevent the
first shot from being vigorous. -
