All these saps when exposed for some time
to Air were found to have deposited
[underline]solid matter[/underline]
The general tendency of some of
the constituent principles of the sap
to solidify is proved indeed by many
different experiments.
Mucilage Tannin or the astringent principles
or even certain of the vegetable acids when exposed
to the oxygene of the air slowly unite to it and
are converted into substances analogous to woody
fibre.
In our artificial processes by applying
oxygene in a form of fluid [underline]combination[/underline] to
a vegetable [underline]juice[/underline] . we in al[deletion]l[/deletion]most all cases
occasion a considerable deposition of solid
matter.
