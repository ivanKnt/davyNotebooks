Bark forms only upon the Alburnum at the
upper part of the wound and extends gradually
toward the lower part.
This demonstrate the motion of the sap
toward the [underline]bark[/underline] after it has been exposed to
the influence of the atmosphere. -

and astringent matters, and that part of
these substances were in solution in the sap

they are found in much greater abundance
in the barks of trees stripped in spring
than in those of trees stripped in winter
and hence all barks for the use of Tanneries
are procured if possible in the former season
