In the direct beams of the sun the leaves
of plants appear to absorb water and
carbonic acid by their under surface and
give out oxygene gas -
If we immerse a living plant under
water the production of oxygene gas will
be seen to take place from the surfaces
of its leaves; and if the water be saturated
with Carbonic acid the effect will be much
increased - ^
It would appear that in the process
of the Healthy vegetation of leaves the
water and carbonic acid received from
the atmosphere united to the principles
conveyed [deletion]by[/deletion] by the sap were partly
deprived of oxygene in the parynchema
by the agency of light; & rendered more proper
to be converted into inflamable products.
