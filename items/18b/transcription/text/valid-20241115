In the last lecture the Atmosphere and the

That we may be enabled to
understand the nature of the

in which they are operated

processes of vegetation & the

When a [underline]seed[/underline] is placed in contact with moisture
at a temperature above 40 degrees, the eperdimis
or coat by which it is surrounded gradually
swells and becomes looser.
Its Cotyledons are enlarged in their dimensions
and elastic fluid is given out from them. -
In this state the seed is prepared for germinat[insertion]on[/insertion]

Acted upon by the solar rays the bud

die.

in the philosophical transactions
( The sap may be traced [deletion]through[/deletion] in its
process through the albumum towards
the leaves.
For if at the time of the rising of
the sap a number of orifices be made
in the tree, the sap first begins to
flow from the lowest opening [deletion]then[/deletion]
then from the lowest but one, and so
on successively, till at last it makes
its appearances in the highest of all

And when Bonnet made plants grow in
coloured liquids the tinging matter which
was deposited in the wood appeared first
in the lowest part of the albumum, and
gradually ascended higher and higher
till at last it reached the top of the
tree and tinged even the extremities of
the leaves. - ( The rise of the sap in trees
depends partly upon capillary attraction;
But the experiments of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales though
made with a very different end shew that
this power alone is not sufficient to account
for the effect as the force with which
the fluid ascends is sufficient to elevate it
to a considerable height above the vessels
(The following fact may be found in the
vegetable [unclear]Notes[/unclear] N[superscript]o[/superscript]1 P112

(A vine branch of four or five years old 43
was cut through and a glass tube carefully
attached to it, this tube was bent as a siphon
and filled with Quicksilver, and it was found
in the course of a few days that a column

high [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] which is a force equal to that

evidently [deletion]must[/deletion] affect the progress of the

Instance
The rise of the sap as is evident from
many experiments of the same Author
is considerably affected by mechanical
motions [underline]of the Tree or plant; in[/underline]
[underline]consequence of Winds[/underline]
Some young seedling Apple Trees
in the spring of 1801 were planted in the
same situation, (The Roots and the lower
parts of [deletion]them[/deletion] the stems of some of them were
deprived of the power of motion by means of
bandages of Hay, whilst the upper branches
remained in their natural states

It was found in the succeeding summer that
much new wood had accumulated in the stalk
where the parts were kept in motion by the
wind; whilst the lower part had increased but
very little. (M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight explains from these
facts the peculiarity of the forms of mountain Trees
as compared with those that grow in Sheltered
places. The sap is determined in them by
the motion of the lower parts of the Trunk,
(Its ascent is impeded; hence lateral branches
will be produced; the form of which will
be similar to that of the trunk ( and
the insulated and exposed tree will be
as we allways find it, low and sturdy,
and well calculated to resist the heavy
gales to which it is continually
liable. -

The general tendency of some of

Mucilage Tannin or the astringent principles

it is here that it is partly condensed in an

In cases when the bark is removed the

If we immerse a living plant under

with Carbonic acid the effect will be much
increased - ^
It would appear that in the process

^ It is evident on these facts " that perennial
Grapes ought never to be

It is on the same principle
that the tuberous part of the
potatoe ought never to be cut
off round the bud or eye - for
it is in this case deprived
of the greatest part of that
matter which would have afforded

I have already mentioned that many of
the substances found in vegetables are
convertible into such other and that they
differ principally not as to the nature of
their elements but as to the properties
of them.
So that Sugar Tanning principle resin
mucilage and woody fibre are all
congenerous as the primitive matter
that Composes them -
On the subject of the constitution of
vegetable substances a very important
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] has been made within these few
weeks by Mr Hatchett. That Gentleman
has been able to produce the tanning
principle by distiling Nitrous Acid

which seems to shew that the tanning
principle is merely a compound of Charcoal
and pure Air or oxygene and of course
that its elements differ only in proportion
from those of Carbonic Acid
[underline]Instance[/underline]
This fact is in the highest degree interesting
for it may not only lead to immediate
oeconomical applications but may perhaps
point out to us a method of imitating
other vegetable substances -
