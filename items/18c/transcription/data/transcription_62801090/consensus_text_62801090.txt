" Plants are capable of growing
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] by the mere agency of
Water & of [underline]Air"[/underline]; But as
I mentioned in the first lecture
the experiments of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Woodward fully
prove " that in cases when
the water is pure ie holds no
foreign matters in solution -" vegetation
is exceedingly feeble -
This fact has been shown [deletion]still[/deletion]
more recently by the researches
of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hassenfratz - this paper
may be found in the [deletion]13 &[/deletion]
[deletion]14 V[superscript]os[/superscript][/deletion] of the [underline]Annales de Chimie[/underline]
