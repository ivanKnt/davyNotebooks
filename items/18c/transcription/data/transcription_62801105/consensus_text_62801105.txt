When Straw Hay. Tanners Bark. Green weeds or
any similar substances are moistened with water
and placed together in large quantities a
chemical change is speedily produced in
them. Heat is excited elastic fluids are given
out which consist chiefly as in other cases
of decomposition of Hydrocarbonate and Carbonic
Acid. and considerable quantities of Mucilage
and a brown fluid containing much
carbonaceous matter are produced
If the process be continued there is a
rapid absorption of oxygene from the Air -
water is formed in addition to the other
products and the residuum of the chemical
decomposition is charcoal mixed with Calcareous
and silicious earth and a little saline
matter.
