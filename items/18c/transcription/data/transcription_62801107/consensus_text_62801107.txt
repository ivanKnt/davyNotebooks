Peat principally consists of [underline]woody fibre[/underline] which
which has been deprived by the action of water
of saccharine and astringent matter and of
the other matters which were capable of
rapid fermentation And therefore before
it can become an effective manure it is
necessary that some substance should be made
to act upon it Capable of bringing [deletion]into[/deletion]
it into a state of [underline]decomposition[/underline] or into a
state in which it becomes soluble so as to
combine with the organs of plants -
( The method of fermenting peat with
dung had been described by Lord Meadowbanks
It is evident that different peats will
require to bring them into fermentation
different proportions of [underline]the same dung[/underline]
