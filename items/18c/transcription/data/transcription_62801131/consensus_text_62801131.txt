The Atmosphere and in dry [underline]weather[/underline] the
[underline]process[/underline] of decomposition may be assisted
by watering -
The best time for removing dung hills
and for rising them as manure is
probably when the Heat of fermentation
begins to diminish at this period it is
always found that a large quantity of
matter very soluble in water has been
formed -
In all well [underline]established farms[/underline] all
substances that have [deletion]been[/deletion] once been parts
of organized matter should be carefully preserved
even soap suds the washing of the Kitchen
and the water in which vegetables are boiled
should be carried to the Dung hill or recieved
in an appropriate cistern and applied
to the land
