The Secretary to the board found that volatile
Alkali considerably increased the progress of vegetation
it contains Hydrogene and nitrogene in a loose
state of combination: and hydrogene is found
in all plants and nitrogene exists in wheat
and in some other plants.
I moistned in Feby last at Roehampton
some ground sown with cresses and Radishes
with Ammoniac dissolved in 40 times its weight
of water and I found that [insertion]they[/insertion] plants rose much
more vigorous than those in the common soil
But when Ammoniac was used with only
ten times its weight of water the seeds vegetated
very feebly so that in this case as in many
others there is a limit & which produces
beneficial effects a circumstance that
always ought to be attended to in
experiments on vegetation
