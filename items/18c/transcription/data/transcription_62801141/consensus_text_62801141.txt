The residual Charcoal or Coaly matter of
vegetable or animal decomposition it is
most likely is seldom or never taken up by
plants in its solid state unless under
circumstances of particular communication
But when Charcoal is acted on by air
and water it is slowly converted into
fixed Air and inflamable Air is given
out from it -
This is shewn when Charcoal is introdu[insertion]ced[/insertion]
under a jar filled with water elastic fluid
will slowly rise from it
The new products evolved by the Solution-
of Charcoal are has been already stated
capable of becoming the food of plants
and thus by a continued process of chemical
changes all the parts of dead animals
