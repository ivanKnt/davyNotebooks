When Quicklime is digested with woody fibre
a soluble compound is produced from it
containing vegetable matter and its elements
are more or less separated from each other
by the affinities of the Lime
Lime when found in the [unclear]species[/unclear] of plant
is always in combination with Carbonic
Acid and vegetable matter so that if it
exert any agency on their living powers
it most probably can only be at the time
that it is taken up by their roots
In [underline]application[/underline] of Quicklime to land must
be regulated by many circumstances
If a soil contains too much [underline]vegetable matter[/underline]
This substance will be useful in producing
its decomposition and by bringing it into
a compost
