[underline]4 Manures[/underline]
No part of Agriculture is perhaps more capable
of being elucidated by chemical enquiries than
the doctrine of [underline]Manures[/underline]
The efficacy of these substances depend
upon their composition and the changes that
they undergo and their agencies upon plants
are immediate objects of Chemical science
The most important manures are those
that supply nourishment to the plant; and
the greater and the greater number of these
[underline]manures[/underline] consist of matter that had been before
organised of vegetable or animal substance
Vegetable and animal substances differ in
their composition but they contain certain
analogous principles. -

" Plants are capable of growing

Water & of [underline]Air"[/underline]; But as
I mentioned in the first lecture
the experiments of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Woodward fully
prove " that in cases when
the water is pure ie holds no

is exceedingly feeble -

The greater number of vegetable substances
as was shewn in the first lecture are resolved
by Heat into [underline]Compounds[/underline] which consist for
the most part of Hydrogene oxygene and
[underline]Carbon[/underline]-
Animal substances also produce when
decomposed compounds of these principles:
but they likewise give out Ammonia or
volatile alkali which is seldom a product
of vegetables and Nitrogene the same with
the elastic fluid or the Atmosphere incapable
of supporting combustion.
At the time when the application of
pneumatic chemistry to agriculture was
first made it was supposed that Carbon
was the only principle of nourishment

more accurate observations show that this
opinion is not correct.
All the principles found in growing plants
are likewise found in manures and it is
their constitution which make them soluble
and capable of being assimilated to their
living organs -
Hydrogene and oxygene as well as carbon
must be constantly observed in the fluid presented
to plants.
Hydrogene forms a considerable part
of their organized matter-
And as manure is consumed in vegetation
and as Hydrogene is not given out in the
process it follows that it must enter into

must form a part of its food -

When Straw Hay. Tanners Bark. Green weeds or

of decomposition of Hydrocarbonate and Carbonic

When pure vegetable matter is to be mixed

If it is used before the Heat required

upon plain and hard ground and if
possible the scite of it should be paved
with flat stones and surrounded with a
very low wall and no fluid should be

It too often happens that Dunghills
are made upon loose soils and upon
declivities in which cases much useful
manure is necessarily lost.

depends upon the action of Air of moisture

placed in such a manner as to be exposed

The best time for removing dung hills
