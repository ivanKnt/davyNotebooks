In dry climates the soil ought to be possessed of a
Strong attraction for [deletion]water[/deletion] moisture; and in this case
it should contain a considerable proportion of aluminous
and calcareous Earth -
In moist [underline]climates[/underline] the soil ought to abound in
silicious earths which is possessed of a feeble
affinity for water which in its common form of
aggregation is much more [underline]permeable than Alumine[/underline]
The powers of Soils to attract moisture depend
not only upon their chemical composition but
upon their mechanical Structure. Alumine, Lime
and silex when in a finely divided state absorb
a much larger quantity of water than when forming
an aggregated mass as sand or gravel -
Instance
These soils which are situated in declevities
ought to be much more retentive of moisture
than those situated in plains or in the bottom of Vallies
