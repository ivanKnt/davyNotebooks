A soil of this composition it is probable would
contain much too large a proportion of sand
to be fertile in the inland Counties of England
where the fall of rain seldom exceeds 25 or 26 Inches
a rich loam similar to that loam from stowess
would be most likely too retentive of moisture in
[deletion]those[/deletion] Climates such as those of Westmoreland
of Cornwall and of Cumberland -
When soils are immediately situated upon a
bed of rock or of stones they are much sooner
rendered dry by evaporation in warm weather
[unclear]Where[/unclear] the subsoil is of Clay or Marle
A Clayey [underline]subsoil[/underline] will sometimes
render fertile a sandy [unclear]soil[/unclear] and in this case
it will retain moisture in such a manner as
to be capable of supplying that lost by
the earth above in consequence of the [unclear]actions[/unclear]
of [deletion]the dry[/deletion] Atmosphere upon it -
