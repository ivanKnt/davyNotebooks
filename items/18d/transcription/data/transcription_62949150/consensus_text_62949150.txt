Sir Hy Vavasour sugested it as a question
whether the fertility of the land to the East
might not be particularly influenced by this
cause ; as our westerly winds blow on a average
for three fourths of the year and of course by
far the largest quantities of soot and smoke and
of effluvia would be carried eastward
In considering the improvements of Soils by
modifying the nature of their Earthy bases -
the principles are sufficiently simple and
obvious though it does not allways happen
that the materials can be easily obtained
All stiff and hard soils are improved by
the addition of sand and gravel and in Cases
when they are not loamy calcareous sand
is more efficacious in rendering them
fertile than silicious Sand. -
