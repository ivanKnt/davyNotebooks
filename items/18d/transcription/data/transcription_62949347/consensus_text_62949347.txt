Clays and loams usually consist
of a mixture of calcareous aluminous and
silicious Earths with a little oxide of Iron
The Calcareous matters in clays or loams
is allways combined with Carbonic Acid
and this substance forms about 1/3

From the quantity of Carbonic Acid
given out during the Action of diluted
Muriatic acid we may pretty nearly
estimate the quantity of Calcareous
earth contained in soils and for every
ounce measure of gas we estimate
about 3 grains of Carbonate of lime
