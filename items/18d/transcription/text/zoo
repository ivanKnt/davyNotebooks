[underline]Lecture 5[/underline]
All those substances that act as manures are
more or less transient in their effects. They are
either converted into organized matter in the
parts of living vegetables or they are decomposed
and changed in consequence of their Chemical
agencies. -
The least durable of the manures are
those that most immediately supply nourishment
to the plant sooner or later they are decomposed
and partily assimilated to its organs and the soil
becomes exhausted of them -
The manures which increase vegetation
merely by their agencies are the substances
contained in soils are more permanent
But even they are continually modified
at the time that they exert their powers
and at length are converted into new

and comparatively inactive substances. -
(natural soils are capable of producing
excellent crops by means of the succession
of different manures -
This is a great source of their improvement
And there is another source much more durable
and no less useful in the modification of the
composition of their [underline]Earthly parts[/underline]
[underline]The Earthy basis[/underline] of Soils as I have already
mentioned differ very considerably as to their
chemical composition and their texture they
act in a different manner upon manures
and they require to be supplied with them
in very different quantities
Those soils are most perfect in their
nature whilst they afford the best support
to the vegetable are capable of attracting
the largest quantity of nourishment

from the Atmosphere and of continually
supplying the roots with a proper quantity
of moisture. -
As yet soils have been too little attended
to be accurately classed according to their
chemical composition and they are generaly
distinguished from each other by their difference
in their forms of their aggregation -
The most usual soils are [deletion]chalk[/deletion] Clays
Clayey loams chalks and Calcareous loams
Gravel soils stoney brashes or stoney soils
silicious sandy soils calcareous sandy
soils and peats -
The primitive earths found in soils
as I have already mentioned are Alumine or
the pure matter of Clay silex or the [deletion]earth[/deletion]
earth of flints Lime and [underline]magnesia[/underline]

[page]8||dnp18d04pp|62949055[/page]
[page]9||dnp18d05pp|62949059[/page]
5
The Alumine in soils is possessed of a strong affinity
for water and it is to a great extent the cause of their
tenacity -
The silicious earth is less retentive of moisture than
Aluminous Earth; but it renders the soil loose and
fit for receiving the roots, of plants
The Calcareous matter or Carbonate of lime is extremely
retentive of moisture
Magnesia is seldom found in soils but its action
in its Combined state is very analogous to that of
Alumine. -
As different vegetables are nourished by food in some
measure different and as they require to be supplied
with it in different Soils.
The nature of the soils which different vegetables
demand must however in some measure depend upon
the state of the sourrinding Atmosphere and
upon the nature of [underline]the Subsoil[/underline] or the Stratum
in which the [underline]soil[/underline] is [underline]situated[/underline]. -

[page]10||dnp18d06pp|62949067[/page]
[page]11||dnp18d07pp|62949074[/page]
7
In dry climates the soil ought to be possessed of a
Strong attraction for [deletion]water[/deletion] moisture; and in this case
it should contain a considerable proportion of aluminous
and calcareous Earth -
In moist [underline]climates[/underline] the soil ought to abound in
silicious earths which is possessed of a feeble
affinity for water which in its common form of
aggregation is much more [underline]permeable than Alumine[/underline]
The powers of Soils to attract moisture depend
not only upon their chemical composition but
upon their mechanical Structure. Alumine, Lime
and silex when in a finely divided state absorb
a much larger quantity of water than when forming
an aggregated mass as sand or gravel -
Instance
These soils which are situated in declevities
ought to be much more retentive of moisture
than those situated in plains or in the bottom of Vallies

[page]12||dnp18d08pp|62949080[/page]
[page]13||dnp18d09pp|62949086[/page]

As has been already mentioned wheat Barley and
most of the grasses require soils more tenacious
and retentive of moisture than the plants producing
bulbous roots; but [insertion]that[/insertion] any peculiar composition of
soil which would be the cause of fertilizing in
one climate could not be taken as a standard
in an other Climate where the circumstances
of temperature and of evaporation were different.
Thus in Cornwall the fertile soils consist[deletion]s[/deletion] often
of silicious and aluminous earths the quantity
of Rain that falls upon a square foot annually
is about 41 Inches according to M[superscript]r[/superscript] Daltons tube
in the Manchester memiors - It consists nearly
1/2 and the remainder alumine and silex with
scarcely any perceptable quantity of Calcar[insertion]e[/insertion]ous
matter -

[page]14||dnp18d10pp|62949090[/page]
[page]15||dnp18d11pp|62949093[/page]
11
A soil of this composition it is probable would
contain much too large a proportion of sand
to be fertile in the inland Counties of England
where the fall of rain seldom exceeds 25 or 26 Inches
a rich loam similar to that loam from stowess
would be most likely too retentive of moisture in
[deletion]those[/deletion] Climates such as those of Westmoreland
of Cornwall and of Cumberland -
When soils are immediately situated upon a
bed of rock or of stones they are much sooner
rendered dry by evaporation in warm weather
[unclear]Where[/unclear] the subsoil is of Clay or Marle
A Clayey [underline]subsoil[/underline] will sometimes
render fertile a sandy [unclear]soil[/unclear] and in this case
it will retain moisture in such a manner as
to be capable of supplying that lost by
the earth above in consequence of the [unclear]actions[/unclear]
of [deletion]the dry[/deletion] Atmosphere upon it -

[page]16||dnp18d12pp|62949102[/page]
[page]17||dnp18d13pp|62949109[/page]
13
A Sandy or a gravelly subsoil often corrects
the imperfections of too great a degree of
tenacity and absorbent power in the trees soil
In Calcaseous Countries the soil is often found
only a few inches above the Limestone and
its fertility is not improved by the nearness
of the rock though in a less absorbent [underline]soil[/underline]
this situation would occasion barreness.
[underline]Instance Cornwall[/underline]
The absorbent power of a soil may be easily
estimated by drying it before the fire at a
temperature equal to about 212 Fah[superscript][underline]ht[/underline][/superscript] and then
ascertaining how much it increases in weight
by exposure [deletion]of[/deletion] to the Air for a certain number
of hours. I found that 100 grains of marle
from Stowey gained very nearly 3 grains in
an experiment made in April in tolerably
dry weather - 
estimated by drying it before the fire at an

[page]18||dnp18d14pp|62949119[/page]
[page]19||dnp18d15pp|62949122[/page]
15
The composition of soils and of subsoils
considered in their relations to climate affairs
general indications of their fertility but
this essential property is influenced by some
additional causes -
[Horizontal rule]
Thus it is found that the north side of a Hill
is usually more fertile than the south side
other circumstances being the same
The effect probably depends in some manner
upon the influence of the Sun which tends to
produce too rapid decomposition of the organizable
matter of the soil. In this country likewise our
heavy gales and rains are principally from the
South west - and the fall of great rain would
injure the soil by Causing some of the finely
divided earth [deletion]to be[/deletion] and vegetable matter
to be washed away - 
[underline][/underline]

[page]20||dnp18d16pp|62949130[/page]
[page]21||dnp18d17pp|62949137[/page]
17
Those soils are often possessed of a peculiar
degree of fertility which are situated at the
feet of Hills and they receive from the water
which flows over them a certain quantity of
manure.
The position of lands with regard to Cities
and Towns it is likely may have some influence
on their productive powers.-
Very large quantities of smoke and soot and
of animal effluvia are continually raised
into the Atmosphere from large Cities and they
are deposited at different distances or carried
down by rain or dew and they contain elements
useful as the food of plants.
it is reasonable to conclude that the
change produced in the Atmosphere around
such a City as London must have some
effect upon the lands in the surrounding County.

[page]22||dnp18d18pp|62949145[/page]

[page]23||dnp18d19pp|62949150[/page]

Sir Hy Vavasour sugested it as a question
whether the fertility of the land to the East
might not be particularly influenced by this
cause ; as our westerly winds blow on a average
for three fourths of the year and of course by
far the largest quantities of soot and smoke and
of effluvia would be carried eastward
In considering the improvements of Soils by
modifying the nature of their Earthy bases -
the principles are sufficiently simple and
obvious though it does not allways happen
that the materials can be easily obtained
All stiff and hard soils are improved by
the addition of sand and gravel and in Cases
when they are not loamy calcareous sand
is more efficacious in rendering them
fertile than silicious Sand. -

[page]24||dnp18d20pp|62949159[/page]

[page]25||dnp18d21pp|62949166[/page]
21
Marles and chalks which are too retentive of
moisture and too rich in Calcareous matter
required to be supplied with silicious and alumin[insertion][unclear]ous[/unclear][/insertion]
Earths
In cases when Clay exist in a soil in great
excess and in countries where silicious or calcareous
Sand cannot be easily procured ploughing and
Burning the land is sometimes employed with
[underline]advantage[/underline] as in this case the form of aggregation
of the Clay is altered and its absorbent powers
are considerably diminished.-
instance
In cases in which silicious sand exists in too
great [insertion]an[/insertion] abundance in soils [underline]Liming[/underline] to a certain
extent may be employed with advantage ,
Chalk and Marls tend in all cases to improve
Soils that contain an [deletion]of[/deletion] excess of Alumine
and Silex.
And where [underline]burnt lime[/underline] is employed it at
first acts as a secondary manure as has been

[page]26||dnp18d22pp|62949174[/page]

[page]27||dnp18d23pp|62949179[/page]
23
already stated and then becomes a part
of the permanent Earthy basis of the Soil
In applying quicklime to common cultivated
Lands as I have already stated the greatest
care must be taken not to employ the Magnesian
Limestone
It may be known from the common limestone
by very simple chemical tests
It is found in abundance in different parts
of [underline]England[/underline] Specimens - Matlock Breedon
Derbyshire [underline]East Lothian[/underline] [unclear]x/unclear]
Calcareous Earth in its caustic state soon becomes
perfectly mild by combining with the Carbonic
Acid and water existing in the Atmosphere
as is evident from what has been before
said
Magnesian Earth on the contrary after
being once deprived of Carbonic Acid
by Heat

[page]28||dnp18d24pp|62949185[/page]

[page]29||dnp18d25pp|62949193[/page]
25
is an immense length of time in recovering it
and in its caustic state it acts as a poison in
destroying plants.
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Tennant found that seeds would not
vegetate in a soil containing a certain
proportion of pure magnesia -
Magnesia in its perfectly mild and native
state does not appear to be at all injurious
to vegetation
It forms a part of certain soils which even
in their common states are found productive
as pastures
The best limestone is that which rapidly
dissolves in Acids without leaving any
residuum
Limestone may be easily anal[deletion]y[/deletion]ised by
being acted upon by cold muriatic Acid
if any solid matter remains it is aluminous
or silicious Earth -

[page]30||dnp18d26pp|62949201[/page]

[page]31||dnp18d27pp|62949206[/page]
27
When magnesia is present it may be precipitated
by pure Volatile Alkali or Ammoniac about 1/4
is added to its weight and the whole sub[deletion][unclear]x[/deletion][/unclear]tracted
from the weight of the matter dissolved the
remainder is the weight of the Carbonate of Lime
which consists of about 2 parts of pure Calcareous
matter and one part of Carbonic Acid
Instance
The Magnesian Limestone in general contain
about 40 p[superscript]r[/superscript] Cent Carbonate of Magnesia and 60
Carbonate of lime. -
This substance in its calcined state is most
prejudicial to such [underline]soils[/underline] as contain only a small
quantity of vegetable decomposing matter and
in cases when it has been accidently applied
to them in large proportions it has rendered the
Land barren for many years
In soils that contain an excess of manure
or of vegetable matter it is less injurious

[page]32||dnp18d28pp|62949214[/page]

[page]33||dnp18d29pp|62949221[/page]
29
and it has even been employed with good
effects in the cultivation of peats. -
This circumstance it is not difficult to explain
astringent vegetable matters which usually exists
in peats are capable of entering into chemical
combination with magnesia so as to form
slightly soluble compounds with it -
Lime should never be employed to Land
in its dry or unslacked state unless it is
designed [deletion]unless[/deletion] for the purpose of destroying
vegetable matter.
In the finely pulverised state which it
assumes by exposure to the Atmosphere it is
capable of being aquably diffused through
the soil
It alters the form of aggregation [deletion]it alters[/deletion]
of the other Earths during its combination
with Carbonic Acid

[page]34||dnp18d30pp|62949231[/page]

31
In exerting its affinity upon the decomposing
vegetable matter[deletion]s[/deletion] tend to render them soluble
in water or preserves them in union with
the Soil. -
It often happens in soils containing a great
excess of Sand; that the finely divided Calcareous
and aluminous matter is gradually carried
below the surface of the agency of water
and deposited on the upper Stratum of the
Subsoil-
In these cases deep [deletion]ploughin[/deletion] plowing is
of great advantage to the land and a kind
of renovation of the most active part of
the soil is occasioned by it. -
[Horizontal rule]
[underline]In cases[/underline] when Subsoils contain any considerable
portion of vegetable matter exposure of their
upper surface to the air by means of the plough
is extremely beneficial to the land

[page]36||dnp18d32pp|62949238[/page]

[page]37||dnp18d33pp|62949245[/page]
33
and in certain cases they be burnt with
advantage when mixed with the Common
soil -
The method now generally adopted for
improving peats so as to render them
capable of [underline]bearing grain[/underline] is by the [deletion]applicati[/deletion]
application of Quicklime -
In this case the Quicklime is mixed in its
slacked and powdery state with the surface
of the [underline]peat[/underline] and that decomposing vegetable
matter which before was unfavorable to the
growth of useful plants is by means of its
[underline]agency[/underline] converted into a species of [underline]manure[/underline]
Those peats are most easily cultivated
which are fixed upon a subsoil of Clay
or of Earthy matter and which Contain
the smallest quantity of living moss -

[page]38||dnp18d34pp|62949254[/page]

[page]39||dnp18d35pp|62949262[/page]
35
In cases when peats are very deep and
impregnated with bitumen or Sulphureous
matters they are rendered fertile with great
difficulty and they can only be freed from
the noxious matters by long exposure to
the Air in their state of mixture with
Lime. -
In the Derbyshire peat Hills where the stratum
of peat is [deletion]unus[/deletion] usually thin and superincumb[insertion]-ent[/insertion]
in loose clay [underline]Lime[/underline] is almost the only material
found necessary for rendering the land productive
[underline]And[/underline] by means of successive applications of
Lime and deep plough[underline]ing peat soils[/underline] in
Derbyshire are raised in value in the course
of a few years from 1 shilling to 25
shillings the Acre -

[page]40||dnp18d36pp|62949268[/page]

[page]41||dnp18d37pp|62949274[/page]
37
In other countries in which peats are very deep
and consisting chiefly of the slowly decomposing roots
and fibres of vegetables and in the peats of
moorland it is necessary to employ other
substances with lime which are capable of
altering the form of aggregation of the peat -
Clay sand and gravel are [insertion]all[/insertion] useful in giving
that consistency which is required to enable it
to support the roots of the roots of the more
perfect vegetables
Decomposing Winstone or the soil incumbant
on Basalt as there is every reason to believe might
be employed with advantage -
And in some Cases it is necessary to use a
small quantity of [underline]dung[/underline] for bringing the
vegetable matter of the peat into a more
rapid state of decomposition by
fermentation -

[page]42||dnp18d38pp|62949282[/page]

[page]43||dnp18d39pp|62949289[/page]
39
In the common processes for changing the nature
of lands by modifying the proportions of their
earthy constituent parts the Farmer is seldom
guided in his experiments by any fixed principles
and his efforts are consequently often [unclear]uncessful[/unclear]
That the best method of improving soils
may be adopted it is necessary that in each
individual instance the chemical [underline]Composition[/underline]
should be known
The minute Analysis of soils is connected
with considerable labour and many difficulties
but that examination of them useful for the
purposes of Agriculture may be speedily
accomplished and made with little trouble
or expence

[page]44||dnp18d40pp|62949300[/page]

[page]45||dnp18d41pp|62949302[/page]
41
The apparatus required for the chemical
examination of Soils is now before you
It contains all the substances necessary and
the most important parts of it are these
bottles. The [underline]tests the funnel and the ballance[/underline]
In cases in which the general nature of
the soil of a Field is to be ascertained specimens
of it should be taken in different places and
separately examined so as to determine how
far they differ. (for taking the average
composition by mixing together different
parts would afford no useful indication.

[page]47||dnp18d43pp|62949317[/page]
43
The water contained in a soil may be chiefly
expelled from it [insertion]by[/insertion] heating it to a degree equal
to about 300 Fht and the proper temperature
may be known by introducing a small piece of
wood and examining it at different of the
Process.
The small stones gravel or large vegetable
fibres may be seperated from the dry and
[deletion]divided[/deletion] divided soil by means of a sieve
Instance
To know wether any saline impregnations
exists in soils noxious to vegetation it is
necessary to pour boiling water upon a portion
of them and if the fluid when passed through
the filtre has no taste nor smell produces
no change of tint on litmus paper and no
 [deletion]turpidness[/deletion] turpidness nor colour in Hepatic water
we may be sure that it is free from saline

or metalic bodies which would be [underline]hurtful[/underline]
[underline]to plants[/underline] -
[underline]As[/underline] I [underline]mentioned[/underline] in a former lecture the
quantity of decomposing organized matter
or of [deletion]a[/deletion] manure in a Soil may in some
measure be judged of by the quantity of
Hydrocarbonate given out during the time
of its ignition in a gunbarrel;
when [unclear]x[/unclear] soil is deprived of vegetable
matter by means of Heat and the agency
of Nitrate of Ammonia the substance
remaining is usually a mixture of Clay
or loam with very different proportions
of Sand .
And the best method of seperating these
substances is working with common water

[page]50||dnp18d46pp|62949339[/page]

[page]51||dnp18d47pp|62949347[/page]

when from their different powers of being
suspended in water. -
Clays and loams usually consist
of a mixture of calcareous aluminous and
silicious Earths with a little oxide of Iron
The Calcareous matters in clays or loams
is allways combined with Carbonic Acid
and this substance forms about 1/3
of the weight of Carbonate of Lime
From the quantity of Carbonic Acid
given out during the Action of diluted
Muriatic acid we may pretty nearly
estimate the quantity of Calcareous
earth contained in soils and for every
ounce measure of gas we estimate
about 3 grains of Carbonate of lime
