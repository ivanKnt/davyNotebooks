By drilling the earths are brought into a state
of more minute [underline]division[/underline] and the principles of
the atmosphere are enabled to act more effectually
on the organs of the plant beneath the soil
- And these circumstances could be most
[underline]necessarily[/underline] of most importance in cases in which
the soil was in a state of firm coherence -
From the principles of Chemistry there would
be every reason to suppose that the drill Husbandr[insertion]y[/insertion]
would be most useful in countries in which
little rain fell than in those in which the
climate is moist. -
The reason is obvious [deletion]from what I have[/deletion]
said in [deletion]a [underline]former lecture[/underline].[/deletion]
[deletion]That[/deletion] the earthy substances exert a [underline]greater[/underline]
[underline]action[/underline] upon the moisture of the Atmosphere
in proportion as they are more [unclear]munitely[/unclear] divided -
