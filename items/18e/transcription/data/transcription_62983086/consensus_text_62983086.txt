vegetables are destroyed buried beneath the

Fallowing is of great use only in
such lands as are overgrown with weeds
or have remained for a great length of
time out of tillage and in the common
course of the best husbandry it is I believe
seldom adopted except for a short interval
The increase of the fertility of the soil
is not found adequate to compensate for the
want of produce during a whole year and
a regular succession of different crops
with proper manures appear to be the most
