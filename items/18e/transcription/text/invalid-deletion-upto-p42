[deletion]The fertility of a soil depends upon the composition[/deletion]

In dry soils as there is every probability from

- There is a fact relating to this subject which
occured [deletion]the year before last[/deletion] [insertion]3 years ago[/insertion] and which I had an
opportunity of observing.
The Turnips in Somersetshire generally failed
in consequence of the great drought except in a
few instances in which they were sown very deep
in this case the subsoil supplied moisture to
the roots of the plant long after the surface had
been dried and burnt up

perfect division of the Land than in the Common

- [underline]Weeds and living[/underline] vegetables when burried [insertion]in[/insertion] any

The drill husbandry has been hitherto most
employed in light and sandy soils, in which the

By drilling the earths are brought into a state

the atmosphere are enabled to act more effectually
on the organs of the plant beneath the soil
- And these circumstances could be most

From the principles of Chemistry there would

On the general [deletion]merits[/deletion] Question of the [underline]comparative[/underline]

which they are respectively considered as most
useful -
It is likely that each system has peculiar
advantages and the minute theory of their

accurate scientific examination of the difference
of the Lands [deletion]and[/deletion] on which each method is
most successfully employed and applied and the

to many different [underline]causes[/underline].
Water is absolutely necessary [deletion]to[/deletion] essential to
vegetation and when land has been covered by
water in the winter or in the beginning of Spring
the moisture that has penetrated deep into the
soil and even the subsoil, becomes a source
of nourishment to the roots of the plant in
the [underline]summer and prevents[/underline] those bad effects
that often happen in [underline]lands[/underline] in their natural

it may perhaps in some instances tend to
ameliorate the soil
Common river water also generally
contains a certain portion of organizable
matter which is much greater after rains than
at other times and which exists in the
largest quantity when the stream rises in
a cultivated Country.
Even in cases when the water used for
flooding is pure and free from animal
or vegetable substances, it acts by causing
the more equable diffusion of nutritive
matter existing in the land[deletion]s[/deletion] and in very
cold seasons it preserves the tender roots
and leaves of the Grass from being
affected by frost - . -
