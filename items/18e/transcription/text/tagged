Water is absolutely necessary [deletion]to[/deletion] essential to

Common river water also generally
contains a certain portion of organizable
matter which is much greater after rains than
at other times and which exists in the

a cultivated Country.
Even in cases when the water used for
flooding is pure and free from animal

the more equable diffusion of nutritive
matter existing in the land[deletion]s[/deletion] and in very
cold seasons it preserves the tender roots

In the system of draining it is necessary

The new method of [underline]boring[/underline] and diverting
the Spring will apply in all instances in
which the strata are tolerably [underline]level[/underline] and
the source of the water distinct -
But in some countries where the Rocks
are very unequal and where the water
is collected in dykes it will be
necessary to carry it off by a level
lower than that of the Bog Land -

It is involved in obscurity and it can
