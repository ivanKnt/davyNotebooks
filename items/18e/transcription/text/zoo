In the common practice of Agriculture
certain substances are then mixed with the

they are sown - 
[underline]Wheat[/underline] is sometimes steeped in brine but
more commonly it is mixed with a small
quantity of powdered or slacked quicklime
Neither of these substances appear to be
possessed of any peculiar chemical agency
upon the grain; and and its great efficacy
is probably that of defending it in some
measure from the attacks of insects -

Water is absolutely necessary [deletion]to[/deletion] essential to
vegetation and when land has been covered by
water in the winter or in the beginning of Spring
the moisture that has penetrated deep into the

it may perhaps in some instances tend to
ameliorate the soil
Common river water also generally
contains a certain portion of organizable
matter which is much greater after rains than
at other times and which exists in the
largest quantity when the stream rises in
a cultivated Country.
Even in cases when the water used for
flooding is pure and free from animal
or vegetable substances, it acts by causing
the more equable diffusion of nutritive
matter existing in the land[deletion]s[/deletion] and in very
cold seasons it preserves the tender roots
and leaves of the Grass from being

The distance and the nature of the stones

processes of draining and irrigation is of
considerable importance
All [insertion]the[/insertion] water that flows over Land has its origin
in the precipitation of moisture from Air
Hills and mountains being usually colder than

The new method of [underline]boring[/underline] and diverting
