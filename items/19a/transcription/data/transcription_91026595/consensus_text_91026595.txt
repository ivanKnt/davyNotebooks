The first form of society which the Elder
writers have described and of which many
instances at present exist upon the Globe
is that of a few persons united in families
or Hordes - associated for mutual defence
and protection; but without government or
laws and regulated in their actions only
by a few moral ties dictated by experience
used for conveniences and the result rather
of necessity than of reason.
In such a condition in which the [underline]wants[/underline]
connected with the support of existence are
many and the means of gratifying them
[underline]few[/underline]-.
In which there is an almost constant
necessity for bodily rather than for mental
exertion. -
