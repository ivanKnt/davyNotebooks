14
For it is only when subsistence is easily
procured that a number of persons can be
associated upon one spot.
And without an extended social [underline]intercourse[/underline];
no great improvements have ever been produced
The love of discovery and of intellectual
acquirement may indeed be called an almost
instructive faculty of the mind but still a
combination of circumstances is required
to call it into useful exertion -
The truly insulated individual can effect
little or nothing by his unassisted efforts -
It is from minds nourishing their strength
in solitude and exerting that strength
in society that the most important truths
have proceeded.
