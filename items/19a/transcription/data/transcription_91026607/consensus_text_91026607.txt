An argument in favour of the superior
antiquity of the Hindoos deduced from their
astronomical tables was often brought forwards
in the middle and towards the End of the
last century and particularly by the
french mathematicians -. who attempted
to shew that actual observations were
made by the brahmins on the position of
the planets and on eclipses nearly six
thousand years ago -
This argument however has been wholly
relinquished by the latest and most distingu[insertion]ished[/insertion]
writers on Astronomy -
And it may be considered as [underline]for ever[/underline]
[underline]silenced[/underline] by an elaborate memoir published
at Calcutta in 1801 by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bentely
