It will not be necessary to enter upon very
extended views in order to perceive the small
value of the proofs adduced by the [underline]french Philosopher[/underline]

its foundations are weak its materials slender
and a feeble effort will be sufficient for
its destruction. -
[underline]M. de. la. Place[/underline] has shewn that the
relations of some of the calculations in the
Indian tables to a high Northern latitude merely
accidental -
And there is great reason to believe that
it was owing to the multiplied errors of the
ancient astronomers -
The general demonstrations of the modern
date of most of the estimations which I
have before quoted will likewise apply strongly
[underline]to this question[/underline]
