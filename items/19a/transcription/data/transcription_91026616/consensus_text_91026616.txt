Man dependant for many of his enjoyments
and even for the continuance of his existance
upon the objects of the external inanimate
world is from the very laws of his Nature
necessitated to connect with them strong
interests and feelings:
These interests and feelings must have
been experienced in all states of Society
but there is every reason to believe that
they would be most vivid in the [underline]savage[/underline]
[underline]beginning[/underline] to be cultivated in the mind in
which imagination was gradually taking
place of common and unmixed sensation

effects of heat the beauty and uses of the
light of the Sun Moon and Stars the
operation of dews on vegetation the influence
of rivers in producing fertility verdure
