This invention is indeed ascribed to Pythagorus
by some of his Biographers but there is the
greatest reason to beleive that it formed only
a part of the general information acquired by

doctrines of pythagorus was that no blood should
be shed:

is said not to have been overstocked with wealth
and must have had some difficulty in making
such a sacrafice -
The nine numerical characters now
employed in Europe were certainly invented
