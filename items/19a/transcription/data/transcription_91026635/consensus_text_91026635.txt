There is a passage in one of their [insertion]ancient[/insertion] fragments
quoted by Amiot relating to the measurement
of the Earth which if it be supposed Authentic
is very curious.
It is stated that the Earth was measured
by Chin Yen and was found to be of greater
length from East to West than from North
[underline]to South[/underline] - a fact only known in Europe
within the last century: - and determined only
in consequence of the invention of the sublime
[underline]Theory of Newton[/underline]-
The account of this exploit is however
as marvellous as any of the Arabian tales:
For [underline]Chin Yen[/underline] is represented as having been
what Amiot translates [underline]un homme[/underline] Esprist not
[underline]un homme desprit[/underline] [underline]not a [deletion]material[/deletion] natural[/underline]
but a supernatural [underline]Genius[/underline]. -
