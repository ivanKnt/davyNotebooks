At an age when [underline]Egypt and India[/underline] were enjoying
a considerable share of cultivation and refinement
Greece was still uncivilized and the habitation
of a few savage and unconnected tribes of
Men. -
The Country was colonized by strangers from
the South and East who brought with them
arts and inventions. -
But the knowledge of the first advancement
of population and improvement is lost in the
fables of Heroic Ages
Amidst the turbulance of the first efforts made
by a people to rise out of the barbarous state
there could exist no [deletion]leisure[/deletion] leisure for meditation
and no [underline]minute views[/underline] except those connected
[underline]with the passions or the wants of Men[/underline] -
