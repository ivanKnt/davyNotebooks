The first school of Philosophy was
established in [underline]Ionia[/underline] - And the founder
of it was Thales [underline]the miletian[/underline] -
More is accurately known concerning
the incidents of the life of this ancient
Philosopher than of the tenour of his
opinions - his rank was high his
political influence great -
But his ambition was rather directed
toward instructing men [underline]than governing them[/underline]
And he travelled though [underline]Greece[/underline] Egypt
and [deletion]phoencia[/deletion] in quest of [underline]knowledge[/underline]
which it is said he was as ready to communicate
as to receive. -
Thales left behind him no writings -
and of the spirit of his philosophy changed
by time modified by his [underline]disciples[/underline] and
interfused into or blended with other systems
