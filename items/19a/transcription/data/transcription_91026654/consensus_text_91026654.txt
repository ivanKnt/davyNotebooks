Thales if we [deletion]might[/deletion] [insertion]may[/insertion] credit the most ancient
of the Greek Historians was not only
acquainted with [underline]the causes[/underline] of Eclipses
but was able likewise to predict the times
in which they would occur. -
But this his great knowledge it is said
He never applied for the purposes of deception
but freely communicated and explained
in the true spirit of an [underline]enlightened mind[/underline] -
He is recorded as having fixed the partition
of the sphere into five zones and to have
divided the year into 365 days. -
All his Biographers agree that he
devoted a great portion of his time to the
study of the heavenly bodies and the
constellations. -
