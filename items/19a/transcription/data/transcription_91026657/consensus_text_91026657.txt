In the age of Thales Philosophy [underline]was respected[/underline]
[underline]and honoured[/underline]: He was considered as a benafactor
to his Country - and lived in the fulness of
Glory to a good old age
He died about 548 years before Christ at
the Olympic Games - And his Countrymen
honoured him with a monument and with a
inscription composed in the usual [underline]stile of[/underline]
[underline]simplicity[/underline] of the Greek [underline]Epigram[/underline] -
Here Thales rest the wise
Small his tomb
But great his fame
Attested by the skies. -
Thales had [underline]many disciples[/underline] even [underline]amongst[/underline]
[underline]the Rich and great men of his own Nation[/underline]
but none of them are recorded in [underline]History as[/underline]
[underline]having modified or extended his[/underline] doctrine except
[underline]Anixamander[/underline] -
