This ancient Philosopher if the opinions
attributed to him are correct details appear
to have been guided more by the love of
novelty than the gift of right reason in
attempting alterations of the dogmas of his
master -
This he is said to have attributed Eclipses
not to the intervention of the Moon or Earth
but to the closing of an orifice in the Sun
from which he supposed the light to shine
And he denied [underline]that water was the composing[/underline]
[underline]element of bodies[/underline] and asserted that [underline]infinity[/underline]
[underline]was the principle of all things[/underline] -
The last Philosopher of [underline]the Ionic School[/underline]
[underline]who continued at Miletus[/underline] was Anaximenes
[underline]the friend the follower and at last the[/underline]
[underline]rival of Anixamander[/underline] -
