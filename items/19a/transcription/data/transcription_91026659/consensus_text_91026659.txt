The peculiarity of his physical doctrine
consisted in his attributing to Air a power
almost unlimited of composing bodies of
changing and of acting upon them -
He explained the formation of clouds by
the condensation of [deletion]air[/deletion] an aieral vapour:
and rain he considered as produced from
these clouds by the conversion of Air into
water and hail and snow by the freezing
of Rain -
He was well acquainted with the remote
causes of the Rainbow though not with the
refined philosophy of the seperation of light
We are informed by Plutarch - he conceived
the Rainbow as originating in the [underline]separation[/underline]
[underline]of light through clouds or mists - but no[/underline]
[underline]explanation[/underline] is adduced of the variety of its
colours
