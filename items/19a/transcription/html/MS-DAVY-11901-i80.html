         <p>A pupil of Plato's whose philosophical idealism he came to reject, arguing instead
            for the primacy of observations of natural phenomena. He thus established the divide
            between theory and experiment in science that can still be detected today. Aristotle's
            writings became the main way the natural world was understood from the Middle Ages
            to the seventeenth century, especially in the universities.</p>
