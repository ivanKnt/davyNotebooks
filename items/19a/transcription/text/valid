[underline]History of Natural Science[/underline]
[underline]1[superscript]st[/superscript][/underline]
The primary faculties and feelings
of the human mind are the same in all
ages and in all climates -
And the experience obtained during the
progress of society constitutes the great
foundation of every [underline]species of knowledge[/underline].
A high and a just importance in
consequence has been attached by all Enlightened
minds to Historical details. -
They have always been regarded with
deep interest as affording rules of action and
instances of Conduct as exhibiting representations
of [underline]Nations[/underline] in their various states of

Cultivation and as offering the resources of
wisdom by explaining [underline]the causes[/underline] have
produced, their [underline]strength[/underline] [underline]or their[/underline] weakness
their [underline]elevation[/underline], or [underline]their decline[/underline]. -
The political the moral and the
religious changes that have happened in
the general series of events are necessarily
those that occupy the [underline]first and the[/underline] most
[underline]exalted[/underline] place in history
The [underline]truths[/underline] deduced from them are
of the most immediate application,
The incidents belonging to them of the
highest character: they appeal [underline]most strongly[/underline]
to the reason: and are most capable of affecting
the passions -
[underline]The relations of man to Nature. -[/underline]
the influence of physical discovery and
of inventions in the Arts during the

Long course of ages offer perhaps objects
of [underline]subordinate effect,[/underline] they have consequently
been less attended to by Historians
But though of subordinate effect they
cannot be said to be either useless or
insignificant: -
They have assisted and operated with
the other great causes in producing beneficial
results
By means of Natural Science many errors
have been conquered: many prejudices destroyed
new sources of enjoyment produced and
painful wants removed.
By promoting the Causes of [underline]right reason[/underline]
it has in some measure contributed to the
perfection of [underline]social Institutions[/underline]:
And in its refined state by exhibiting the

wisdom of the constitution of the Universe
it has been subservient to the most sublime
[underline]truths of religion[/underline]. -
The progress of [underline]rational[/underline] [underline]Philosophy[/underline]
has been slow and peaceful and seldom
connected with splendid or striking events
But it is never the less highly worthy
of being considered both on account of its
practical uses and of [underline]its[/underline] exalted views:
The [underline]lives[/underline] of [underline]Men[/underline] [underline]of Science[/underline] indeed
and the details of their labours offer few
impressive or seductive [underline]traits[/underline] -
But [underline]their Glory[/underline] if [underline]less tumultuous[/underline]
than that of Heroes and Conquerors the
usual subjects of historical praise
cannot be said to be less durable.

Their influence though not so extensive has
never [underline]been destrcutive: and almost constantly[/underline]
[underline]beneficial:[/underline] -
And the [underline]pictures[/underline] which their works unfold
though they may exhibit [underline]less of Brilliancy[/underline] and
of beauty present likewise [underline]less of gloom[/underline] and
of [underline]confused shade[/underline]. -
[underline]2.'[/underline]
The period of discovery of the first rudiments
of the knowledge of Nature is [underline]wholly unknown[/underline]
The germs from which they arose were
cultivated in an age of which no distinct
record has been brought down to modern times
Sacred History devoted to more important objects
affords no light to this investigation:
And the traditions relating to it found
in the writings of the earliest profane
Authors obscured by superstition or adorned

[page]10|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00010|dnp19a08pp|91026594[/page]

by enthusiasm of enigmas only from
which various conjectures [insertion]may[/insertion] be drawn but
[underline]no certain[/underline] [underline]truths[/underline] deduced. -
Assuming however what all known
facts seem to demonstrate that the progress
of civilization must have been slow and
gradual and keeping in view the nature
of [underline]physical truths[/underline]. and the faculties
required for the attainment of [underline]physical[/underline]
[underline]truth[/underline] it will not be difficult to divine
the state of cultivation, in which the
first advances were made towards physical
[underline]discovery[/underline].
And in which the objects of the external
world were first considered in their
minute relations to each other and in
their subserviency to general laws. -*

The first form of society which the Elder
writers have described and of which many
instances at present exist upon the Globe
is that of a few persons united in families
or Hordes - associated for mutual defence
and protection; but without government or
laws and regulated in their actions only
by a few moral ties dictated by experience
used for conveniences and the result rather
of necessity than of reason.
In such a condition in which the [underline]wants[/underline]
connected with the support of existence are
many and the means of gratifying them
[underline]few[/underline]-.
In which there is an almost constant
necessity for bodily rather than for mental
exertion. -

[page]12|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00012|dnp19a10pp|91026596[/page]

In which the imperfect Arts known have resulted
from accident and not design: and in which
Language is only the expression of passion or
of sensible objects connected with passion: -
In such a state of social existence it is scarcely
possible that any scientific views or any
scientific combinations could have been formed
The savage hunter of early ages may
indeed have been directed by the stars in
his route through forests as the American Indians
of modern times -
He may have learnt practical inferences with
regard to the seasons the relations of certain
appearances in the Atmosphere by the state
of the weather and other general indications
concerning the facts of Nature;

11
But generalizations and abstractions concerning causes
must have been wholly unknown to him -
For they require long continued and regular
observations and must have  been the result of quiet
meditation assisted by [underline]active genius[/underline]. -
The primary stage of civilization in which
we are permitted by facts or analogy to hail the
dawning of Natural Knowledge must certainly
have been first enjoyed by pastoral or Agricultural
Nations.
An Age in which a regular government had been
formed property acquired certain refined arts invented.
security afforded by equal laws and a division
of labour established, granting [underline]leasure to certain[/underline]
individuals and [underline]enabling them to exercise the[/underline]
[underline]higher faculties of the understanding[/underline]. -

[page]14|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00014|dnp19a12pp|91026598[/page]
12
Though the documents in our possession
with regard to the countries in which orderly
political institutions were first formed are
obscure and imperfect yet when assisted by
first reasonings in physical cirumstances
they will afford perhaps sufficient light
to enable us to form general views on
the subject or at least they may satisfy
[underline]the[/underline] imagination without obliging it to
multiply conjecture and lose itself in
perplexity. -
Those parts of the Globe which were
most immediatily peopled after the [misc]misc_092|deluge[/misc]
certainly appear to have been the temperate
regions of Asia and Affrica -
We have the authority of the scriptures
to prove that [underline]these[/underline] regions were the places
both of the birth and of the renovation of
the human species:

[page]15|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00015|dnp19a13pp|91026599[/page]

And at the term when the accurate Chronology
of the greek writers commences they are known
to have contained by far the most polished Nation
of Antiquity those most advanced [underline]in power in[/underline]
riches in [underline]knowledge and in useful inventions[/underline]
In the Northern Climates it required a great
number of ages before man had so far subdued
the poverty of the soil as to be able to provide
with certainty for his support -
But under the tropics the almost spontaneous
fertility of the Earth must speedily have given
him security with regard to his power of
gratifying the most pressing of his wants
And such a circumstance where some difficulites
were still to be conquered and positive
indolence impossible must have been highly
favourable to the increase of Civilization -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00016|dnp19a14pp|91026600[/page]
14
For it is only when subsistence is easily
procured that a number of persons can be
associated upon one spot.
And without an extended social [underline]intercourse[/underline];
no great improvements have ever been produced
The love of discovery and of intellectual
acquirement may indeed be called an almost
instructive faculty of the mind but still a
combination of circumstances is required
to call it into useful exertion -
The truly insulated individual can effect
little or nothing by his unassisted efforts -
It is from minds nourishing their strength
in solitude and exerting that strength
in society that the most important truths
have proceeded.

And the materials of the magnificent structure
of Human Knowledge though connected by a
few minds have been furnished by many
though cemented by unity of genius they
have been produced by the diversity of Labour. -
Amongst the Nations considerably advanced
in civilization in the remote ages of the World
The Egyptians Indians and Chinese undoubtedly
occupy the first stations: but the early
periods of their history are unknown
National Vanity uniformly endeavours to
create forms of greatness in the obscurity of
time
And the unbounded claims of those people to
high antiquity can only be supported by
supposing that their ages mean years and

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00018|dnp19a16pp|91026602[/page]
16
[underline]their years days or hours[/underline] - for few of the
Chinese are pleased unless their empire be
allowed to have lasted at least 200.000 years
And some of the Bramins go still higher
and in round numbers are not contented
with less than two millions -
The Egyptians are rather more modern they only
ask fifty thousand years: and yet almost all the
facts in our possession are in favour of their having
been civilized in an earlier time than any
other [underline]known people[/underline]
The power the riches and the population
of Egypt at least fifteen hundred years before
Christ are described in [otherwork]otherwork_330|Exodus[/otherwork] and the learning
and wisdom of the people celebrated.
The first poets and philosophers of Greece
who journeyed into almost every part of the
east in quest of information are acknowledged

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00019|dnp19a17pp|91026603[/page]
17
by their own Countrymen to whom the pride of
later greatness must have made the concession
difficult to have gained their principal stores
of Knowledge and of Art from Egypt. -
Diodorus who himself had travelled into
Egypt fully proves in his history that most of
the earlier fables of the mythology of Greece
and Italy were remotely derived from that people
And the traces with distinctness in many of the
common ceremonies of the Egyptians performed
in his own age the foundations of some of
the dogmas of superstition supposed to have
been brought into Europe by orpheus and
Thus He shows that the [person]person_843|jupiter[/person] of the Greeks
is the same with that of the Egyptians that
their [unclear]Poros[/unclear] is indentical with metora and
that the names of Vulcan of minerva and

18
of [unclear]Nyssa[/unclear] had been used in Egypt from
the Earliest times
It has long been known that there is a
considerable connection between the religious
systems of the Hindoos and that of the Egyptians
but the distinct nature of this connection
has only been lately develloped and that
by the labours of those of our own Countrymen
whose talents and genius have removed
the veil from the stores of oriental
learning and substituted facts and real
knowledge for vague insufficient conjecture
In a paper published by Capt Wilford in
the third volume of the Asiatic Researches
indubitable evidences are brought forward
to shew that the Nile and the general
aspect of Egypt are described in the

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00021|dnp19a19pp|91026605[/page]
19
sacred books of the Brahmins and that
the relations of the of the two
nations necessarily imply at some period
a community of opinions or at least an
early intercourse between them. -
Now there are no historical documents to
shew that the Hindoos have ever emigrated
in bodies from their native Country -
But the Egyptians are uniformly recorded
as displaying a fondness for enterprise
[underline]and a love of Colonization[/underline]. -
Manetho himself an Egyptian who is said
to have flourished nearly 300 years before Christ
is quoted by Josephus as stating that the
reign of Amenophis nearly [deletion]a[/deletion] 1000 years before
his own time, in consequence of a religious

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00022|dnp19a20pp|91026606[/page]
20
persecution carried on by this King a number
of Egypatians left their Country and that
many passed into Libya; and that many
embarked in the red sea and penetrated
into India -
The exploits of though perhaps
blended with much fable there is great
reason to believe must have had some
foundation in facts -
And according to Herodotius this monarch
extended His conquests in the Countries
beyond the Red Sea He is said to have
subdued the greatest part of Asia to
have crossed; and to have planted many
Colonies in the east for preserving the
power and diffusing the Arts of the
Egyptians

21
An argument in favour of the superior
antiquity of the Hindoos deduced from their
astronomical tables was often brought forwards
in the middle and towards the End of the
last century and particularly by the
french mathematicians -. who attempted
to shew that actual observations were
made by the brahmins on the position of
the planets and on eclipses nearly six
thousand years ago -
This argument however has been wholly
relinquished by the latest and most distingu[insertion]ished[/insertion]
writers on Astronomy -
And it may be considered as [underline]for ever[/underline]
[underline]silenced[/underline] by an elaborate memoir published
at Calcutta in 1801 by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bentely

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00024|dnp19a22pp|91026608[/page]
22
This Gentleman has distinctly shewn that
the the most ancient treatise of
Astronomy extant in Hindostan could not have
existed more than 740 years and yet this
very work is stated by the Brahmins to have
been received by divine revelation no less
than 2'164900 years ago
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bentely by describing the astronomical
tables of the Hindoos seems clearly to have
shewn the pretended [underline]observations[/underline] [underline]of high[/underline]
[underline]antiquity[/underline] are merely forgeries derived
from calculation -
And He shews that their deviation
from the results gained by modern methods
[underline]does not[/underline] depend upon irregularities in
the [underline]system of the Heavens[/underline] [underline]which have[/underline]

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00025|dnp19a23pp|91026609[/page]
23
[underline]not been[/underline] estimated nor upon the defects
of late investigations; [underline]but realy[/underline] upon
the insufficiency of the Indian [underline]Science[/underline]
and upon the arbitary [underline]assumption[/underline]
[underline]of remote periods.[/underline] -
In speaking of the early advancement
of civilization it would be improper not to
make some reference to the opinions of
[underline]Monsieur Bailly[/underline] concerning the origin of
the sciences -
His work though it has meet with few
defenders has never been formally contradicted
the high Character of the [underline]ingenious[/underline] and
unfortunate [underline]Auther[/underline] alone would be sufficent
to secure it from the silence of Contempt
And it is only by very late discoveries and
researches that his principles can be proved
to be erroneous and his statements of facts imperfect

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00026|dnp19a24pp|91026610[/page]
24
Bailly has attempted to demonstrate
that the Arts and the [underline]Scientific methods[/underline]
belonging to the early oriental Nations
to the Hindoos the Chinese the Egyptians
and Chaldeans are far from being indigenous
but merely the remains the imperfect relics
of [underline]a sublime and[/underline] extended system [underline]of Philosophy[/underline]
discovered by a more ancient and more enlightened
people who have wholly disappeared from the Globe
but the monuments of whose greatness and wisdom
are still in existince. -
The descriptions of [misc]misc_377|the Island in Plato[/misc]
said to be founded upon the records of the Egyptian
priests has been usually considered as wholly
fabulous, yet Bailly in his ancient Astronomy
selected it as the seat [underline]of the great primitive[/underline]
Nation whom He represents at once as the
conquerors and cultivators of the Earth. -

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00027|dnp19a25pp|91026611[/page]
25
In his last publication the letters to Voltaire
He seemed however to relinquish this Idea and to
fix their abode in Tartary in the Country
surrounding the [underline]lake Backal[/underline]. -
His great argument in favour of this singular
Hypotheses is that many of the Astronomical observati
recorded in the Hindoo writings appear to have
been made in 49° of North latitude and that
most of the more early calculations in them
are fitted for the same climate -
His secondary arguments are deduced from the
[underline]similarity[/underline] of the institutions ceremonies and
Arts of the Various Nations of Asia - which He
conceives shews that they must have had
one common source -
He endeavours to obviate the difficulties
that arise in the discussion from the [underline]consideration[/underline]

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00028|dnp19a26pp|91026612[/page]
26
of the present coldness and barren state of
[underline]upper Tartary[/underline] by assuming [underline]with Buffon[/underline] that
the earth was infinitely hotter in ancient times
than at the present day and that it has
been gradually cooling being in its first state
a Globe of fire. -
And He supposes that thought the land about
the lake [underline]Backal[/underline] is now for two thirds of
the year covered with snow and the sky
almost constantly clouded yet that it was
anciently in consequence of the high heat
of the Earth the most beautiful and
habitable part of it mild in its temperature
productive in its soil and fitted for a
nation of Philosophers whose labours were
principally devoted to Astronomy to the
refined Arts and to the sublime Science

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00029|dnp19a27pp|91026613[/page]
27
It will not be necessary to enter upon very
extended views in order to perceive the small
value of the proofs adduced by the [underline]french Philosopher[/underline]
His structure is [underline]splendid and beautiful[/underline] but
its foundations are weak its materials slender
and a feeble effort will be sufficient for
its destruction. -
[underline]M. de. la. Place[/underline] has shewn that the
relations of some of the calculations in the
Indian tables to a high Northern latitude merely
accidental -
And there is great reason to believe that
it was owing to the multiplied errors of the
ancient astronomers -
The general demonstrations of the modern
date of most of the estimations which I
have before quoted will likewise apply strongly
[underline]to this question[/underline]

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00030|dnp19a28pp|91026614[/page]
28
A Hundred explanations might be given
one almost as probable as the other with
regard to the connection between the various
systems of the East. -
[underline]And M[superscript]r[/superscript] Buffons splendid Theory of the Globe[/underline]
is wholly disowned by modern experimentalists
And History seems to prove rather a
slight increase than any diminution
of temperature. -
The Ideas of Bailly were not very probable
in the time when they were produced: -
they are now wholly visionary - His system of
conjectures will however [insertion]always[/insertion] be admired as a beautiful
[underline]Scientific Romance[/underline]
It is written with peculiar elegance
It displays the poet rather than the Philosopher
And it is impossible to peruse it without being

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00031|dnp19a29pp|91026615[/page]
29
captivated by the polish of the language the
Majesty of the diction and the pomp and
splendour of description. -
Bailly had the art of Cloathing error
in such brilliant colours that it is quitted
with regret and like an accomplished actor
He deludes by the power of his genius: and
induces a strong sympathy with regard to a
mere fictitious effect. -
What ever opinion we [underline]may form[/underline] concerning
the [underline]people by[/underline] whom the [underline]earliest advances were[/underline]
[underline]made in cultivation and refinement[/underline] it is
impossible not to [deletion]preserve[/deletion] perceive a distinct
connection between all the early systems of
[underline]superstitions[/underline] and [underline]imperfect explanations[/underline] of
the phaenomena of Nature the unformed
rudiments of Science. -

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00032|dnp19a30pp|91026616[/page]
30
Man dependant for many of his enjoyments
and even for the continuance of his existance
upon the objects of the external inanimate
world is from the very laws of his Nature
necessitated to connect with them strong
interests and feelings:
These interests and feelings must have
been experienced in all states of Society
but there is every reason to beleive that
they would be most vivid in the [underline]savage[/underline]
[underline]beginning[/underline] to be cultivated in the mind in
which imagination was gradually taking
place of common and unmixed sensation
In such a state of society the beneficial
effects of heat the beauty and uses of the
light of the Sun Moon and Stars the
operation of dews on vegetation the influence
of rivers in producing fertility verdure

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00033|dnp19a31pp|91026617[/page]
31
and life must have been associated with the
strongest pleasure
Whilst the destructive agency of Storms and
of tempest long continued dryness and the terrible
effects of lightning and of thunder must
equally excited pain and alarm. -
Hope and fear consequently would arise
with regard to these [underline]agents of Nature[/underline] ignorance
would attach moral sentiments to them unknown
powers would be supposed to govern them.
And [underline]all the[/underline] changes of things [underline]considered[/underline]
[underline]as relating[/underline] to the [underline]destinies of Man[/underline]: -
Accident and peculiar facility of observation
by assisting acute and penetrating talents
would inevitabily in the course of time lead
certain men of Superior genius to the
Knowledge of some few connections of causes
and effects -

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00034|dnp19a32pp|91026618[/page]
32
And this knowledge which it was scarcely
possible to devellope to the vulgar/
cultivated as a source of power would
be extended with assiduity and preserved
with Caution;
And the first enquirers [underline]into Nature[/underline] would
from the habits of the age immediately
become the interpreters of the spiritual
powers supposed to be active [underline]in Nature[/underline]
and the first expounders and contrivers
of the diversified systems of Idolatry. -
That this is not a mere metaphysical
speculation is evident from the universal
tenour of the various [underline]mythalogical Histories[/underline]
which have been received from [underline]the ancients[/underline]
The earliest philosophers on record
are the priests of  Isis of and of
Babylon -

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00035|dnp19a33pp|91026619[/page]
33
And their private doctrines are proved to
have been for the most part mere
explanations of the appearances of the
external world.
Thus we are informed by Diodorus in a
chapter which I have already quoted that
in the sacred mysteries of the Egyptians
Osiris and Isis were considered as the
Sun and the Moon to whose influence upon
the Earth they attributed all great and
important changes. -
The same Author mentions that the
five lesser deities of the Egyptians were distinctly
personifications of the Elements. -
That [person]person_795|Jupiter[/person] represented [underline]the Ether[/underline]. the
[underline]most active[/underline] and penetrating of the forms
of matter Minerva the Air. Vulcan fire
Metora the Earth and water

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00036|dnp19a34pp|91026620[/page]
34
And He explains from the continued [underline]changes[/underline]
of these [underline]principles[/underline] and the diversity of
the forms they assume in different bodies
The general History of the metamorphoses
of the Gods who were considered as having
past through almost every form of being
as having lived in the skies in the land
and in the Seas. -
And who were worshipped with the same
fervency by the vulgar whether represented
by permanent symbols in Idols of stone
or considered in their series of transmutation
upon the Earth in the forms of inanimate
matter vegetables insects fishes birds and
Quadrupeds. -
In the religious creeds of the Hindoos
the multiform incarnations of [misc]misc_568|V[/misc]

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00037|dnp19a35pp|91026621[/page]
35
and of the other deities seem to express
the same general truths of the
transmutation of matter. -
And as would appear from the enquiries
of the most refined of the oriental Scholars
[misc]misc_568|V[/misc] represents water - Earth and
flame Heat [underline]and light[/underline] [underline]or the Sun[/underline].-
In the more [underline]general fables[/underline] likewise
which have been embraced by a great
variety of ancient Philosophical sects
such fables as the transmigration of Souls
and the opposition of the various spiritual
powers in Nature.
Similar allegories denoting philosophical
truths seemed to be [deletion]expressed[/deletion] expressed

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00038|dnp19a36pp|91026622[/page]
36
Thus the continued change of animated
forms the destruction of one species of
organised matter and the production
of another the apparent conversion of
Air and of water into solid matter & their
subserviency to the purposes of life
and the decay and renovation of living
beings may easily be conceived to have
given rise to the Idea of a continued
circulation of the principles of Vitality
and of their living and moving in
a variety [underline]of forms[/underline] ever changing in their
attributes but the same and unsubdued

truths of Natural Knowledge with
mythology it is not however intended to
imply [underline]that all[/underline] the [underline]various branches[/underline] and
modifications [underline]of the ancient superstitions[/underline]
had precisely the same source -
Men who had relinquished principles of
right reason and who were uninstructed
by revelation could have found no
difficulty in transforming their [deletion]devotion[/deletion]
[underline]devotional feeling and in multiplying[/underline]
[underline]the number of their Gods[/underline]-
And it appears certain that in very
early times divine honors were paid to
Heroes and to the discoverers of the [underline]useful[/underline]
[underline]Arts[/underline] and some moral and political
truths combined in the general and
abstracted system of worship. -

Amongest all the nations likewise one divinity
was considered [underline]as supreme[/underline] a ruler and
creator a father of Gods and Men -
This opinion might possibly have been
preserved by tradition amongst the heathen
nations as a remnant of true religion at
time professed only by one people: -
But it is equally probable that it was
[insertion]-s-[/insertion]
the result of that high almost instinctive
conclusion which must arise in every mind
of sensibility from a perception of the
excellence and harmony of the arrangements
in nature: -
For even in the ages of Idolatory
there must have been always men of
genius and feeling in whom the

magnificence and order of the external
world must have called up that emotion
which is described by a modern poet as
[otherwork]otherwork_165|A sense sublime of something far more[/otherwork]
[otherwork]otherwork_165|deeply interfused -[/otherwork]
[otherwork]otherwork_165|Where dwelling in the light of setting Suns[/otherwork]

With respect to the sciences of the
oriental Nations in their highest state
of cultivation the sciences abstracted
from the applications of Mythology there
are scarcely any authentic Histories. -

The true system of the universe the
revolutions of the planets round the sun
was known to the [underline]pythagorians[/underline] -
And there is great reason to beleive that
it was brought from Egypt by the Illustrious
founder of the sect nearly 600 years before
christ
Though the knowledge of it seems to have
been wholly lost in that Country in later
[deletion]times[/deletion] ages for the priests of Egypt in
the times of the conquests of the Romans
asserted that the Earth was in the middle
of the universe and formed like a boat floating
on the waters and that Egypt was in
the middle of the Earth. -
The Greek and Roman Historians agree
that Geometry was invented in Egypt

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00043|dnp19a41pp|91026627[/page]
41
And the narrative is sufficiently probable
The overflowing of the grounds in that
Country by the Nile obliged the inhabitants
to fix an accurate modes of discovering their
property [underline]and measuring their lands[/underline]. -
The practice of Geometry must evidentaly
have preceeded the Theory the difficult Combina[insertion]tions[/insertion]
of abstracted quantities could never have
furnished the first elements of the Science
and this account of its origin seems
conformable to the usual progress of
systems of General truths. -
Mathematics however could never have advanced
to any great perfection in [underline]the East[/underline]. The Geometry
transplanted from it into Greece was merely of
the most simple [underline]character[/underline] and probably bounded
by the knowledge of the relations of squares made
upon the sides of triangles.

This invention is indeed ascribed to Pythagorus
by some of his Biographers but there is the
greatest reason to beleive that it formed only
a part of the general information acquired by
him in his travels and the circumstances supposed
to be connected with the discovery evidently have
the stamp of fable -
He is said to have been so much rejoiced
as to sacrafice immediately an hundred oxen
to the Gods: -
Now it is known that one of the principal
doctrines of pythagorus was that no blood should
be shed:
And Pythagorus like most other philosophers
is said not to have been overstocked with wealth
and must have had some difficulty in making
such a sacrafice -
The nine numerical characters now
employed in Europe were certainly invented

in India and brought of India by the Arabians
though the period of their discovery is unknown -
The enlightened enquiries of Sir W[superscript]m[/superscript] Jones
have shown that many of the .... ... Compositions
contain various speculations upon the powers
of [underline]Nature some[/underline] of which [underline]have a strong resemblance[/underline]
to the truths of modern Science.
In his [otherwork]otherwork_207|eleventh discourse[/otherwork] He particularly
quotes a passage with regard to [underline]attraction[/underline]
from an [underline]allegorical poem[/underline] [underline]on[/underline] [underline]the divine Spirit[/underline]
The sense is exceedingly remarkable
I shall read a few lines of his translation
There is says the Author a strong propensity
which dances through every atom, and attracts
the [underline]minutest[/underline] particle to some particular object -
Search the universe from its base to its summit
from Fire to Air,, from Water to Earth. from
all below the moon, [deletion]to all above[/deletion]

44
to all above the celestrial Spheres and not
a corpuscle will be found deprived of his
active powers -
And from its energy arises every motion
perceived in heavenly or terrestrial bodies -
Here is undoubtedly an expression of a great
and important truth but appearing as
insulated it is impossible to judge of [underline]the[/underline]
[underline]processes[/underline] by which it was formed or the
system with which it was connected. -
At first view it may be supposed to contain
a devellopment of the [underline]Newtonian Theory[/underline]
but it is in fact merely a generalization on
certain appearances obvious to [underline]common[/underline]
[underline]observation[/underline] and similar generalizations
may be found in the writings of many of
The Greeks. -

The attractive [underline]energies of[/underline] matter had indeed
been perceived by a number of philosophers in
different ages but it was a [underline]glory[/underline] reserved for
our [deletion]Country[/deletion] [underline]immortal Countryman[/underline] that of
develloping the laws by which it was governed
and of [underline]explaining by them[/underline] the great
phaenomena of the Universe. -
The knowledge of the Chinese in
Natural Science has been extolled as of
a very [underline]superior Kind[/underline] by the early missionaries
but the later and more accurate evidences
obtained seem to demonstrate that they are
at present in no respect a [underline]Scientific People[/underline]
and there is no strong reason for believing
that they had made any considerable discoveries
in Natural [underline]Philosophy[/underline] in [underline]remote ages[/underline] -

Their Astronomony is considered of as early
date as that of the Hindoos -.
But it seems never to have been so
perfect and their Astronomical instruments,
were certainly not of native manufacture -
Those which existed in the Empire before
the communication with Europe by Sea

The principal uses made of Astronomical
observations in China is for the Calculation
of Eclipses -
And it is believed throughout the
Empire both by [underline]the learned and unlearned[/underline]
That this effect is produced by the
attempts of an enormas dragon to

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00049|dnp19a47pp|91026633[/page]
47
devour the heavenly bodies and in
consequence they always go into public
mourning when an eclipse is to happen
and use all their efforts in sounding
drums and trumpets and to frighten
the monster away -
It has sometimes occured the calculations
have been mistaken in their predictions
of Eclipses and on this occasion the
greatest consternation has prevailed
throughout the Empire and in one
instance [deletion]the[/deletion] said by [otherwork]otherwork_240|the annals[/otherwork] quoted
by G to have taken place nearly 2000
ago several of the astronomers fell as
sacrifice to the popular fury as it was
supposed that the Dragon not having been

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00050|dnp19a48pp|91026634[/page]
48
terrified as usual by their ceremonies
would inevitably destroy the moon. -
From the accurate and [underline]philosophical work[/underline]
of [person]person_447|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Barrow[/person] on China we learn that the
Chinese physics and knowledge of the Earth
are equally imperfect with their
Astronomy and acquaintance [underline]with the[/underline]
[underline]heavens[/underline]
They have believed for the last two
thousand years that the sky is round the
Earth a square placed in the middle and
the four Elements placed at its four sides
water to the North fire to the South
Wood to the East and metal to the West
and they suppose the stars to be fixed
like nails at equal distances from the
Earth in the Vault of heaven. -

There is a passage in one of their [insertion]ancient[/insertion] fragments
quoted by Amiot relating to the measurement
of the Earth which if it be supposed Authentic
is very curious.
It is stated that the Earth was measured
by Chin Yen and was found to be of greater
length from East to West than from North
[underline]to South[/underline] - a fact only known in Europe
within the last century: - and determined only
in consequence of the invention of the sublime
[underline]Theory of Newton[/underline]-
The account of this exploit is however
as marvellous as any of the Arabian tales:
For [underline]Chin Yen[/underline] is represented as having been
what Amiot translates [underline]un homme[/underline] Esprist not
[underline]un homme desprit[/underline] [underline]not a [deletion]material[/deletion] natural[/underline]
but a supernatural [underline]Genius[/underline]. -

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00052|dnp19a50pp|91026636[/page]
50
He is described as having been of a Green
colour bordering on blue and it is related
that He traversed the air making his
measurement in a Chariot drawn by [underline]six dragons[/underline]
Most of the ancient Chinese books on the
Sciences are said to have been destroyed
about 246 years before Christ by [underline]Chin[/underline] [underline]Chi[/underline]
[underline]Hoang[/underline] who preserved only those relating to
medicine Agriculture and law. -
Whether this account be accurate or
no there is very little reason to doubt
that [underline]the Chinese[/underline] were as enlightened and
as Scientific at least three [underline]thousand years[/underline]
[underline]ago[/underline] as [underline]they are[/underline] in the present day. -

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00053|dnp19a51pp|91026637[/page]

And from what has been before said it is evident
that the case [underline]of most[/underline] of [underline]the southern[/underline] [underline]and Eastern[/underline]
[underline]Nations[/underline] is perfectly [underline]parallel[/underline]. -
The fact is highly impressive but the causes
[underline]are easily traced[/underline]. - they are connected with some
of the most simple of the faculties of the
[underline]human mind[/underline]-
And appear to be perfectly independant of
climate or local circumstances.-
The [underline]first refined[/underline] [underline]Inhabitants[/underline] of Egypt
and Chaldea have [underline]disappeared[/underline] before the
swords of Conquerors and their Country has
been peopled by new. -
But in China and in Indostan the original
Nations still exist they have received new
Govenors but their Institutions their manners
and their customs have remained unaltered. -

The slumber of the mind for so it may be
called in the two countries has depended
upon very [underline]different circumstances[/underline] [underline]but[/underline]
[underline]the same[/underline] effect has been produced. -
In India the elements of Science have
been always confined to one [underline]sect of men[/underline] and
used for objects of superstition the were
cultivated only as instruments of [underline]power[/underline]
and the simpler elements were found
perfectly adequate for the purposes of deluding
the Vulgar. -
To the Brahmins there appeared to be no
other motive of discovery: -
And the love of abstracted truth could never
dwell in minds constantly devoted to the
propagation of error -
In China the [deletion]disposition[/deletion] despotism of
the Government has continually opposed itself

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00055|dnp19a53pp|91026639[/page]
53
to [underline]general improvements[/underline] in the Arts [underline]and[/underline]
[underline]the systems[/underline] of [underline]Philosophy[/underline] -
The language which is said to contain few
or no [deletion]abstractions[/deletion] [insertion]abstractions[/insertion]- would seem in consequence
to be wholly unfitted for the purposes of
Scientific [underline]combinations[/underline]. -
For two thousand years no glory has been
attached to the inventions of [underline]physical truth[/underline]
The highest honors of the Empire are
connected with the study of a system of
[deletion]which[/deletion] letters [insertion]which[/insertion] has constantly unchained [underline]the understanding[/underline]
and fixed the narrowest boundaries to its exertion
And the person possessed of the most profound
Knowledge with regard to Nature and Man
would be held in no estimation at Pekin

The ingenuity of the Chinese is
demonstrated by their [underline]manufactures[/underline].
Their power of exertion is known to
be great -
The elements of Genius exist in the
People but there are no moral causes to
call them into activity -
And pride and superstition and
ignorance equally oppose themselves to
the progress of [underline]Knowledge[/underline]. -

[underline]History of Natural Science Second Book[/underline]
In this age of research of instruction and of refinement
it would be wholly unnecessary to attempt to prove
[underline]"that the[/underline] Greeks were [underline]a very great[/underline] and extraordinary
people [underline]worthy of being[/underline] [underline]studied criticised and admired[/underline]
It is not my intention to endeavour to make a
declamation upon the Grandeur of the Nation and
their fame in Arts in letters and in Arms -
my object is one more humble less imposing and
less impressive -
The scientific character of Greece has as it
were been thrown into shade by the splendour of
her military and political Glory: -
But it is nevertheless far from being undeserving
of our attention -
The advances made in Greece will indeed
appear as ignorance when compared with the
discoveries and inventions of modern times; -

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00058|dnp19a56pp|91026642[/page]
56
But it ought never to be forgotten that it was
from that happy country that the sources of [underline]our[/underline]
[underline]own Science[/underline] were either immediately or remotely
derived.
In Attica indeed the springs of Knowledge
were scanty and their course limited; - for
[deletion]For[/deletion] [insertion]us[/insertion] they flow in depth in fullness and
in strength: - But it [underline]is important[/underline] to trace
the progress of Philosophy even from its most
slender beginnings, to view the mind in the
infancy of its improvement opposing its strength
to the imperfection of it methods, producing
truth by [underline]destroying error[/underline].
And Scientific History offers instances no less
useful than [underline]interesting to the active philosophical[/underline]
[underline]Enquirer[/underline] instances applicable to his pursuits
and guides to his exertions. -

At an age when [underline]Egypt and India[/underline] were enjoying
a considerable share of cultivation and refinement
Greece was still uncivilized and the habitation
of a few savage and unconnected tribes of
Men. -
The Country was colonized by strangers from
the South and East who brought with them
arts and inventions. -
But the knowledge of the first advancement
of population and improvement is lost in the
fables of Heroic Ages
Amidst the turbulance of the first efforts made
by a people to rise out of the barbarous state
there could exist no [deletion]leisure[/deletion] leisure for meditation
and no [underline]minute views[/underline] except those connected
[underline]with the passions or the wants of Men[/underline] -

In the infancy of the discovery of alphabetical
characters verse and words arranged according
to an harmonious succession of sounds seems
to have been the first mode of communicating
and preserving instruction -.
Where knowledge was chiefly [insertion]traditional[/insertion] it was not only
convenient but essential to employ such
methods as they at once assisted the memory
and combined information with pleasure
The fragments of the Poem of Orpheus and
the immortal productions of Hesiod and of Homer
afford us almost the only documents for judging
of the early state of Greece.
In those descriptions though highly interesting
though capable of giving the most exalted pleasure
there is however little to arrest the attention of
the Historian of [underline]Natural Science[/underline]
Orpheus is the poet of a Cosmogony [underline]of an[/underline]
[underline]account[/underline] of the [underline]origin of things[/underline] possessing the

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00061|dnp19a59pp|91026645[/page]
59
same features as those of the oriental nations
and evidently derived [underline]from the same source -[/underline]
Hesiod in his works occasionally refers to a
species of Astronomical Knowledge and describes
several of the constellations - And He connects
their appearances with the[deletion]ir[/deletion] changes of seasons
His Authorities seem however rather the observation
of Sheppards and husbandmen than those of philosop[insertion]hers[/insertion]
They appear to have had no relation to any
system of [underline]science[/underline] existing in his age. -
and are such as men exposed to the elements
and in a great measure dependent upon them
would be compelled by the strongest motives
[underline]to collect[/underline] in almost [underline]every age and every Climate[/underline]
In the Iliad and the Odyssey which form
[underline]their Characters[/underline] would seem to be the production
of a later age - The exploits the virtues and
the vices of Heroes and of Men occupy the great
attention [underline]of the Father of Heroic Poetry[/underline] -

Even the Gods no longer appear in the their
connection with the Phaenomena of [underline]Nature[/underline]
but are cloaked in [underline]human forms[/underline] and
endowed with human attributes and passions
In the time of Homer the Greeks had risen
far above the Agricultral and [underline]pastoral state[/underline]
Beginning to accumulate in Cities: the
business of war of political institutions
the bustle of active life and the growing
inventions in the Arts were sufficient to
absorb their attention and employ all the
acuteness and strength of their minds -
The Greeks who inhabited the sea Coasts of
Asia Minor arrived first at that degree of
refinement essential to the true [underline]cultivation[/underline]
of philosophical literature and of [insertion]the[/insertion] observations
of Nature -

Devoted to commence the spirit of enquiry
seemed natural to their minds
About the seventh century before Christ they
were rich and powerful and in profound peace
A people of genius possessing liberty of
thought and the power of free discussion -
They ready to [underline]embrace information[/underline] the
moment [underline]it was offered to[/underline] them
And their religious systems had lost all
that stamp and complexion belonging to them
in the east: They no longer bore any relations
to Natural truths but were mere [deletion]mere[/deletion]
ceremonies of Idolatry performed by priests
and soothsayers generally as credulous and
as ignorant as the vulgar to whom they
administered them -
[deletion]The first school was[/deletion]

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00064|dnp19a62pp|91026648[/page]
62
The first school of Philosophy was
established in [underline]Ionia[/underline] - And the founder
of it was Thales [underline]the miletian[/underline] -
More is accurately known concerning
the incidents of the life of this ancient
Philosopher than of the tenour of his
opinions - his rank was high his
political influence great -
But his ambition was rather directed
toward instructing men [underline]than governing them[/underline]
And he travelled though [underline]Greece[/underline] Egypt
and [deletion]phoencia[/deletion] in quest of [underline]knowledge[/underline]
which it is said he was as ready to communicate
as to receive. -
Thales left behind him no writings -
and of the spirit of his philosophy changed
by time modified by his [underline]disciples[/underline] and
interfused into or blended with other systems

[page]65|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00065|dnp19a63pp|91026649[/page]
63
it is difficult to form an [underline]accurate judgment[/underline]
The Ionic sect certainly however sought
into Nature with the views [underline]of experimentalist[/underline]
[underline]and their geometry[/underline] their [underline]astronomy[/underline] [underline]and[/underline]
[underline]their general physics[/underline] as far as the relics
of them are known prove accurate
observations amidst imperfect methods -
and they often exhibit [underline]grand conceptions[/underline]
and bold conjectures some of which have
been realized in modern times -
The principal opinion of Thales in
physics "That which is certainly known to
belong to him" was that water is the [deletion]composing[/deletion]
composing principle of all things -
This notion has passed into the writings of
Philosophers and the works of the poets
Pindar alludes to it in [underline]his celebrated ode[/underline]

[page]66|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00066|dnp19a64pp|91026650[/page]
64
"Water is the best"- and it renders the
passage intelligible and bold when it
would have been otherwise obscure and
common. -
[underline]To a person[/underline] not enlightened by [underline]modern[/underline]
chemistry it is indeed easy to conceive that
water would appear one of the first and
most [underline]productive of Elements[/underline] -
Its vivifying agency upon plants and
animals Its precipitation from Air -
Its apparent - conversion into earth might
well [underline]encourage the idea[/underline] and the marine
venus of the ancients rising in life
and beauty from the bosom of the sea
seems a representation of the productive
[deletion]energy[/deletion] energy ascribed to water by the
philosophers of the Elder school -

[page]67|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00067|dnp19a65pp|91026651[/page]
65
Thales was considered as the inventor or at
least the introducer of [underline]Geometry[/underline] amongst
the Greeks:
It is said even that he carried this science
far beyond the Egyptians who were the first
that applied it to practise -
If the Anecdote recorded be correct of his
measuring the pyramids [underline]by their shadow[/underline] a
method unknown [underline]in Egypt it does not so[/underline]
much prove the acuteness of Thales as
the ignorance of The Egyptians. -
He is said to have fixed a staff of a known length
perpendicular to have measured Its shadow and
likewise to have measured the shadow of the great
pyramid and this conclusion was that as the length
of the shadow of the staff was to the height of the
staff so was the length of the shadow of the pyramid
to its elevation. -
Several practical propositions with regard
to triangles are said to have been ascertained

[page]68|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00068|dnp19a66pp|91026652[/page]
66
by Thales many of those demonstrated in the
[otherwork]otherwork_085|first and second books[/otherwork] of Euclid.
From all that remains of the first Geometrical
Labour of the Ionic school it would appear
that their science was practical and not
speculative
A [underline]Creation of experiment[/underline] and not a work of the
[underline]human mind[/underline] [underline]founded upon[/underline] [underline]self evident[/underline]
[underline]truths[/underline] and [underline]definitions[/underline]. -
The abstract and speculative demonstrations
of the doctrines there is every reason to believe
were ascertained long after the practices
themselves had been invented;
But constucting the [underline]language[/underline] and [underline]the expression[/underline]
of the science: - they became at last the very
elements of it: so as to appear to common
observers [underline]orginal[/underline] and [underline]foundations[/underline], not
established upon facts but upon the refinements
of [underline]Human reason[/underline]. -

[page]69|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00069|dnp19a67pp|91026653[/page]
67
The accounts given of the Astronomical Knowledge
of Thales prove that it was of a much higher
character than that of his Geometrical
acquisitions -
Plutarch informs us that it was his opinion
"that eclipses of the Sun are occasioned by the
intervention of the moon between the Earth
and that great [underline]source of light[/underline]
And that the Eclipse of the moon is caused
by the shadow of the Earth which coming
between this body and the Sun darkens
the moon -
These dogmas so correct in expression of the
real fact prove either the strength of talent
and the minuteness of observation of the
militian Philosopher or the refinement of
the more ancient Science whence his
information might have been derived -

[page]70|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00070|dnp19a68pp|91026654[/page]
68
Thales if we [deletion]might[/deletion] [insertion]may[/insertion] credit the most ancient
of the Greek Historians was not only
acquainted with [underline]the causes[/underline] of Eclipses
but was able likewise to predict the times
in which they would occur. -
But this his great knowledge it is said
He never applied for the purposes of deception
but freely communicated and explained
in the true spirit of an [underline]enlightened mind[/underline] -
He is recorded as having fixed the partition
of the sphere into five zones and to have
divided the year into 365 days. -
All his Biographers agree that he
devoted a great portion of his time to the
study of the heavenly bodies and the
constellations. -

[page]71|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00071|dnp19a69pp|91026655[/page]
69
And he is the original subject of that
ancient and common tale of the "Astronomer
who fell into a well whilst gazing at the
stars, who surveying what was above his
head neglected what was below his feet" -
The genius of Thales from all accounts
was not bounded by physical investigations
A number of his moral axioms are recorded
and his precepts have been given in
verse by Ausonius. -
The strength of some of his expressions
show that he was a wit as well as a
Philosopher - and he is said to have been
dismissed from the Court of Amasis King of
of Egypt on account of the boldness of his
opinions -

Being asked for instance [underline]by a smooth[/underline]
[underline]Courtier[/underline] [underline]of that despotic Prince[/underline]" which
was the most dangerous of beasts" he is said
to have answered "of [underline][deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]wild[/insertion] beasts[/underline] a [underline]Tyrant[/underline]
and of [underline]tame beasts a flatterer[/underline] -
Thales had the dangerous title of wise
bestowed on him and he was one of the
seven sages who flourished in the era of
the rising splendour of Greece -
He is a principal personage in the banquet
of the wise Men described by Plutarch
and which in the detail of the historian
 [insertion]X[/insertion]
is as stupid as an entertainment can be
supposed to be in which seven wise and
prudent persons are made to sit down
for the very purpose of saying nothing
but wise and prudent things. -

In the age of Thales Philosophy [underline]was respected[/underline]
[underline]and honoured[/underline]: He was considered as a benefactor
to his Country - and lived in the fulness of
Glory to a good old age
He died about 548 years before Christ at
the Olympic Games - And his Countrymen
honoured him with a monument and with an
inscription composed in the usual [underline]stile of[/underline]
[underline]simplicity[/underline] of the Greek [underline]Epigram[/underline] -
Here Thales rest the wise
Small his tomb
But great his fame
Attested by the skies. -
Thales had [underline]many disciples[/underline] even [underline]amongst[/underline]
[underline]the Rich and great men of his own Nation[/underline]
but none of them are recorded in [underline]History as[/underline]
[underline]having modified or extended his[/underline] doctrine except
[underline]Anixamander[/underline] -

This ancient Philosopher if the opinions
attributed to him are correct details appear
to have been guided more by the love of
novelty than the gift of right reason in
attempting alterations of the dogmas of his
master -
This he is said to have attributed Eclipses
not to the intervention of the Moon or Earth
but to the closing of an orifice in the Sun
from which he supposed the light to spill
And he denied [underline]that water was the composing[/underline]
[underline]element of bodies[/underline] and asserted that [underline]infinity[/underline]
[underline]was the principle of all things[/underline] -
The last Philosopher of [underline]the Ionic School[/underline]
[underline]who continued at Miletus[/underline] was Anaximenes
[underline]the friend the follower and at last the[/underline]
[underline]rival of Anixamander[/underline] -

[page]75|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00075|dnp19a73pp|91026659[/page]
73
The peculiarity of his physical doctrine
consisted in his attributing to Air a power
almost unlimited of composing bodies of
changing and of acting upon them -
He explained the formation of clouds by
the condensation of [deletion]air[/deletion] an aieral vapour:
and rain he considered as produced from
these clouds by the conversion of Air into
water and hail and snow by the freezing
of Rain -
He was well acquainted with the remote
causes of the Rainbow though not with the
refined philosophy of the seperation of light
We are informed by Plutarch - he conceived
the Rainbow as originating in the [underline]separation[/underline]
[underline]of light through clouds or mists - but no[/underline]
[underline]explanation[/underline] is adduced of the variety of its
colours

The philosophy of Ionia was brought into
Attica - by [underline]Anaxagoras[/underline] who was at once a
Glory and a reproach to his Country in
which he fixed his abode - A Glory in
consequence of his discoveries and his [deletion]met[/deletion]
meritorious public labours A reproach from
the several unjust persecutions he sustained
He was born at Clazomene and he removed
to Athens [insertion]about[/insertion] 450 years Before Christ at a time
when that celebrated city was gaining the
ascendancy in Greece: at the time when Her
Spirit of liberty and their patriotic zeal were
most warmly displayed [underline]in the war against[/underline]
[underline]the Persians[/underline]. -
When Anaxagoras first taught in the schools
of Athens his doctrines [underline]excited general[/underline]
[underline]admiration[/underline]

[page]77|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00077|dnp19a75pp|91026661[/page]
75
To the inhabitants of this rising City [underline]physical[/underline]
[underline]truth[/underline] was new and their [underline]love of novelty and[/underline]
[underline]their caprice[/underline] alone were sufficient a [underline]temporary[/underline]
impulse to [underline]Scientific investigation[/underline]. -
Pericles the greatest general and most
accomplished orator of his Age was amongst
the first of his Scholars - [person]person_887|Archelaus[/person] and Socrates
were initiated by him into the study -
And Euripedes is said to have been one of the
most attentive of his auditors till the popular
clamour began to be raised against Philosophy
when he fortunately relinquished the science
for tragic poetry. -
The doctrines of Anaxagoras are of a much
higher, more accurate and more character
[underline]than those of his [deletion]predecessors[/deletion] predecessors[/underline]

[page]78|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00078|dnp19a76pp|91026662[/page]
76
His mind evidently was endowed with the strong
powers of genius:
And the age in which [underline]he lived[/underline] is sufficiently
[underline]enlightened by History[/underline] to enable us to determine
that a number of his [underline]conceptions were perfectly[/underline]
[underline]original[/underline] not borrowed from the stores of Asiatic
learning but the productions of his own
active and [underline]acute understanding[/underline].
Anaxagoras relinquished the unphilosophised idea of
any one element being the Germ and the producer
of all the forms of matter; and attempted to shew
that uniform bodies were composed of a number of
similar or [underline]elementary[/underline] parts differing however
in their nature in different cases. -
This opinion has been much misrepresented
particularly by Lucretius who attempted to
shew that he supposed organized substances
composed of infinitely small organized parts

[page]79|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00079|dnp19a77pp|91026663[/page]
77
But such an idea of His doctrine is given
neither in the works of Aristotle nor of Plutarch
who may both be supposed more accurate than
the [underline]Roman[/underline] Poet
The object of whose work was to elevate the
[person]person_723|Epicurean[/person] doctrine above all other, and to
shew that the universe resulted from a particular
mixture of atoms.
The dogmas when viewed in the most liberal
sense appears to bear some relation to the more
extended generalization of modern Chemistry
with regard to elements in which they are
supposed to consist of similar parts and in
which no limits is fixed to their number
except such as are [underline]authorized by experiment[/underline]
Anaxagoras is said to have supposed that
lightning was produced by Ether confined in
clouds: and that wind was accassioned by the

[page]80|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00080|dnp19a78pp|91026664[/page]
78
ramification of Air by the solar heat -
Both these opinions display singular strength
of mind -
He certainly could not have divined the nature
of [underline]electrical[/underline] fire but his distinct judgement
led him to perceive [underline]that a powerful and more[/underline]
[insertion]subtle[/insertion] [underline]agent[/underline] than any commonly displayed in the
Atmosphere or on the earth was necessary to
the effect
He is said by Aristotle to have asserted that
the Galaxy or Milkyway is produced by the
blended light of a number of small stars
but other Authors attribute to him less correct
opinions with regard to this [underline]phaenomena[/underline] :-
He is the first person who asserted that
the Moon was a Globe like the Earth
and habitable and that the other
heavenly bodies were likewise composed of

[page]81|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00081|dnp19a79pp|91026665[/page]
79
[underline]Similar Materials[/underline]:
The remarkable fact that He adduces as a proof
[underline]of his assertion[/underline] "that stones have often fallen from
above" I mentioned in the Geological Lectures [insertion]X[/insertion]
Two very ancient writers quoted by Plutarch and
Aristotle. [underline]Silenus[/underline] and Damachus are positive as
to the event of a large stone having fallen in
Thrace a [misc]misc_749|fiery meteor[/misc] having been seen in the
Sky before and the fall is said to have been
connected with flashes of fire and corruscating like
falling stars superstition has added that Anaxagorus
had predicted the fall of this very stone in
The 4[superscript]th[/superscript] year of the seventh olympiad" and that
it portended the great defeat given to the Athenians
Lysander at the [underline] river Egos no less [insertion]time[/insertion] than sixty two[/underline]
[underline]years after[/underline].

[page]82|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00082|dnp19a80pp|91026666[/page]
80
The narrations are however exceedingly curious
The story was disbeleived by most of the ancients
and till within the last 20 years by all the
moderns. -
Multiplied observations have now shew [underline]that[/underline]
stones actually have fallen in great numbers
[underline]on the earth[/underline] and chemical analysis has
proved that they are all of the same species
and perfectly different from any fossils known
to belong to our Globe -
And amidst a variety of opinions that have
been formed with regard to their [underline]origin[/underline] the
first conjecture of the philosophers of
Clazomene that they fall from the heavenly
bodies is perhaps as probable as any other
The Natural Philosophy of Anaxagoras
contains singular and striking truths
but his general notions concerning the

[page]83|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00083|dnp19a81pp|91026667[/page]
81
[underline]universe[/underline] the harmony of things and the
[underline]first cause of Being[/underline] are much more
impressive and wonderful than any of his
physical truths -
He is the first Philosopher recorded who
asserted the existence of one supreme and [deletion]intellectual[/deletion]
[deletion]itill[/deletion] intelligent mind ruling and directing all
things -
Anaxagoras in consequence of his profession of
this doctrine was surnamed Nȣσ or the mind and
ideas seem to have been sublime and more distinct
than those of the platonic [underline]philosophers[/underline] who came
[underline]many ages after him[/underline]-
Thus he is quoted by Cicero and Laertius as
calling the supreme [deletion]being[/deletion] spirit infinite and
self moving not including matter but superior to
it. who when [underline]all was[/underline] confusion produced order
and who by his energy still preserves all
things [insertion]in[/insertion] Harmony.

[page]84|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00084|dnp19a82pp|91026668[/page]
82
The influence of Anaxagoras in modifying
the public character of his disciples was great
and [underline]beneficial[/underline].
He first taught the Warriors and Illustrious men
of Athens to despise the omens and the [underline]predictions[/underline]
of the [underline]soothsayers[/underline]: which had formally directed all
their exploits -
Then a Ram was produced at Athens with [underline]only[/underline]
[underline]one Horn[/underline] The Citizens were in the greatest distress
supposing that the prodigy portended great evils
to the State -
Anaxagoras [underline]disected[/underline] the head and calmed the
people by shewing that it was the effect of
an internal conformation of the [deletion]Skul[/deletion] Scull -
Pericles himself by means of the knowledge
he had acquired from [underline]the philosopher[/underline] was
enabled to infuse spirit into his Sailors and
soldiers terrified at an Eclipse of the Sun

[page]85|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00085|dnp19a83pp|91026669[/page]
83
He made his cloak represent the [underline]Moon[/underline] and
he held it between himself [underline]and the source[/underline]
[underline]of light[/underline]
The explanation was received and the
fleet sailed was prosperous and Victorious -
Anaxagoras in the high conviction of
truth dared to attack upon all occasions
the popular superstitions of Attica -
He soon became obnoxious to the Augurs
and priests who trembled for the decay
of their power and wealth
He was persecuted and at last brought
[underline]to trial[/underline].-
The principal accusation against
him as would appear from the most accurate
authorities "was that he had asserted the
Sun to be a burning mass larger than
Peloponesus"

[page]86|MS-DAVY-11901-000-00086|dnp19a84pp|91026670[/page]
84
This was regarded as an impiety for the
Athenians worshipped this luminary as a
God.-
Anaxagoras has had no worthy biographer and
if Plato or Zenaphon had described this incident
of his life there is every reason to believe
that it would have come down to Modern times
with as high an interest and as powerful
an effect as the ever memorable end of
[underline]Socrates[/underline] -
The first Philosopher who had ever taught
on the continent of Greece "The Man who had
devoted forty years of his life to the service of
his Country whose moral character was without
a stain who had given up his Lands and his
property that he might have nothing to
withdraw his attention from objects of
Science and utility. -
