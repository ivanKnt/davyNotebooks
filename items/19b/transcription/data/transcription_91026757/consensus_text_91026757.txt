[underline]in y[superscript]e[/superscript] war against the Persians[/underline]. -
- |_ When Anaxagoras first taught
in the Schools of [deletion]Athenians[/deletion] Athens,
His doctrines [underline]excited[/underline] general admiration!
|_To the Inhabitants of this rising
City [underline]physical truth[/underline] was new;
& their love of [underline]Novelty &[/underline] their
[underline]caprice[/underline], alone [underline]were sufficient[/underline] to
give a [underline]temporary[/underline] impulse [underline]to[/underline]
[underline]Scientific investigation[/underline] - Pericles the
greatest general & the most accomplished
orator of his Age was amongst
the first of his Scholars - Archelaus
& Socrates were initiated by him
into the study - |_and Euripides is said
to have been one of the most
attentive of his auditors till the
popular clamour began to be raised
[underline]against philosphy[/underline] when He [insertion]fortunately[/insertion] relinquished
Science for [underline]tragic[/underline] poetry. -
- The Doctrines of Anaxagoras are
of a much higher, more accurate
& more impressive [underline]character than those[/underline]
of any of his predecessors
