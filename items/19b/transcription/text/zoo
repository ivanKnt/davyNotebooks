-The [underline][deletion]beautiful[/deletion] [unclear]grand[/unclear][/underline] opinion of Thales

Poets - Pindar alludes to it
in [underline]his celebrated ode[/underline] "Water

passage intelligible & bold, when
it would have been otherwise
obscure & common. -
-- To a person not enlightened
by [underline]modern[/underline] Chemistry it is in [underline]indeed[/underline]

- Thales if we may credit
the most ancient of the Greek
Historians was not only acquainted
with the [underline]causes[/underline] of the Eclipses
but was able likewise to
predict [underline]the times[/underline] in which
they would occur; |_but [insertion]this[/insertion] [deletion]this[/deletion]

- The Genius of Thales (from

- Thales had the [insertion]dangerous[/insertion] title of [underline]wise[/underline]

one of the seven sages who
flourished in the era of the
