He is supposed to say I have spared no labour
in endeavouring to gain Knowledge - I have seen
all the great men of my Age. I have
journeyed through all countries in which I
had the most distant hope of discovering useful
truths. I have never been deterred by the
distance of places nor by dangers nor by
fears of danger. I have observed the
various differences of climates - I have
described the [deletion]phaen[/deletion] phenomena of the Air
the Earth and the waters - the fatague
of body has never disturbed the tranquility
of my mind and even during my travels
I have applied my self to quiet meditation
