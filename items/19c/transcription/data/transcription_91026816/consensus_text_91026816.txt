[underline]reputation than this great Man[/underline]
When Socrates [underline]first[/underline] began to teach in [underline]Athens[/underline]
the great attention of the [underline]Schools[/underline] was employed
upon abstracted questions and the Minds of
the Sophists [underline]were deluded[/underline] and led astray by
the grandeur and sublimity of objects which
it was impossible for them ever to comprehend
Having surveyed only a very small part of the
universe they professed to understand the
mechanism of the whole and in this Age [deletion]scarcely[/deletion]
scarcely a relic of the doctrines of Anaxagoras
or of the truths of the Pythagorean school
[underline]was preserved[/underline] in the theories which were
[underline]metaphysical[/underline] vague and inconsistent
It was against this idle method of forming
vain hypothesis that Socrates raised his voice
