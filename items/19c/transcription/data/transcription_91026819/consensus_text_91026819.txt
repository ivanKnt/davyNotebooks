Socrates left no writings.
The first and greatest of his disciples has supplied

Plato has entered very little upon the subject

only dialogue expressly upon the subject [underline]very[/underline]
[underline]little[/underline] valuable information; but [underline]very much[/underline]
obscure speculation may be found -
The charm of this writer is his adorned
and beautiful stile, in which an imagination
bold and yet correct constantly appears -
Plato in his compositions displays the
highest degree of Art -
