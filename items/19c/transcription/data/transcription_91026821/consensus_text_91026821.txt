Socrates had so much censured, but from which
He could not preserve his most distinguished Scholar
The dialogues of Plato appear to have been often
mere amusements of his imagination, and it is
[deletion]imposible[/deletion] imposssible not to wonder that they should
have proceeded from a man who considered Geometry
as the most sublime of the sciences, and who
inscribed on the Door of his School that it was
open for none but Geometricians -
It may however be said that plato never
speaks in those productions in his own person
but details the opinions of the Philosophers who
had preceded him - He ballances opinions,
He discusses and analyses Hypotheses, and generally
leaves the mind in perfect indecision and
[underline]in ignorance[/underline] of the part that He himself had
taken in the question
