- [underline]Aristotle[/underline] was the disciple of Plato, but the
character of his philosophy is wholly unlike that
of his master -
Plato attempted to raise science to the high flights
of poetry - Aristotle on the contrary endeavoured
to bring poesy to fixed rules and to explain
the principles of eloquence. -
The philosopher of Stagyra [underline]truly conceived[/underline]
that one method was applicable to all the
departments of human knowledge but unfortunately
for the progress of science He himself did not
employ [underline]the true method[/underline] He began with
generalizations and attempted to descend to
particulars and hence his conclusions were
almost always modified according to a
preconceived Theory.
