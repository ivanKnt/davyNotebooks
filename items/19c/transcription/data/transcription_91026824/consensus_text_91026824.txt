The comprehensive mind and the extensive talents
of Aristotle were employed upon all the subjects
of practical or speculative investigation and
when the range that He took is considered we
ought rather to wonder that He discovered truth
at all than to be su[deletion]p[/deletion]prised that He discovered
it so rarely.
The [underline]physics[/underline] of Aristotle are perhaps the least
instructive of his works for He was not an
experimenter, and He was seldom contented to
adopt the opinions of Men who had gone
before him -
He has given very few correct explanations
and his notions on causes are perhaps less accurate
than those adopted in the Early Schools of Greece
Aristotle asserted that the world was eternal
that the expanse of the sky was [deletion]spherical[/deletion]
