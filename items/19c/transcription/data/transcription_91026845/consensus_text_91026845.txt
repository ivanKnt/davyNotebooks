It was in the school of Alexandria that
Aristarchus endeavoured to revive the idea
the notion of the earth - and to measure the
distance of the Sun and He concluded that
this luminary was about 20 times farther
from us than the Moon an estimation [deletion]though[/deletion]
which though incorrect still enlarged the ideas
of men with regard to the extent of the
Universe.
Eratosthenes who succeeded Aristarchus
followed a similar path of observation and
ascertained the obliquity of the Ecliptic at
that time a discovery [underline]of the utmost importance[/underline]
for the progress of the Science
