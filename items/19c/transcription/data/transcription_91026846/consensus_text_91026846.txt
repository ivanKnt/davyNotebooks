But of all the Astronomers of Alexandria Hipparchus -
was the person who made the greatest number of
observations
He formed the first table of the Sun - He determined
the time of the revolution of the Moon and ascertain[insertion]d[/insertion]
the nature of her orbit.
And He made a labourious catalogue of the fixed
stars which seems to have been executed with the
greatest accuracy and precision
Potolemy the last philosopher of the Greek
school of Alexandria flourished about 200 years
after Hipparchus - in the 130 year of the Christian
era - He collected all the observations of his
predecessor and added to them a number of new
ones - He endeavoured to establish a system of
planetary motions by supposing the Earth in
the centre and the sun the moon and the
stars revolving round it
