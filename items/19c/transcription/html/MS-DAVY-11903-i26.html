         <p>A pupil of Socrates, much of Plato's large corpus of surviving philosophical texts
            are written in the form of Socratic dialogues. He espoused a philosophical idealism
            including the primacy of mathematics and an anti-democratic political philosophy because
            of the execution of Socrates. Plato's writings have been, and are, so influential
            that all subsequent philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato.</p>

            <p>a character in two of Plato's dialogues, Timaeus and Critias. In both, he appears
               as a philosopher of the Pythagorean school. If there ever existed a historical Timaeus
               of Locri, he would have lived in the fifth century BCE, but his historicity is dubious
               since he only appears as a literary figure in Plato's works.</p>
