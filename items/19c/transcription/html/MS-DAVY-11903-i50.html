            Some ascribe this to the acuteness of his&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            genius, and others to his indefatigable&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            industry by which He made things that cost&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            a great deal of pains appear unlaboured&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            and easy.&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            In fact it is almost impossible for a man&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            of himself to find out the demonstration of his&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            propositions but as soon as he is taught it he&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            will think he could have done it without assistance&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            By such a ready and easy way does he lead&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            us to what he wants to prove&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            We are not to regret as incredible what is&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            related of him that being perpetually charmed&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            by a domestic syren that is his geometry he&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            neglected his meat and drink and took no care&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            of his person; that he was often carried by force&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            to the baths and when there he would make&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            mathematical figures in the ashes; and with&#xD;<br xml:id="">
            his finger draw lines upon his body&#xD;<br xml:id="">
