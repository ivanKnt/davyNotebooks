The two principal sects in Greece the
subjects of the last lecture as we saw were
evidently guided by very different views and
exercised very different influence in the public
mind -
In the Ionic school all the methods were
disclosed nothing was concealed. - The
abstracted love of truth seemed the principal
guide of the few Philosophers who formed
the sect and rejoicing in the love of [underline]truth[/underline]
themselves they appeared to wish that all
others should experience its effects
and its benefits. -

By the disciples of the Italio school a
double doctrine was preferred =
All the abstruser parts of science were
concealed from the public. They seemed
disposed to make of their Philosophy a
private property and to employ it only [underline]for[/underline]
[underline]private ends and advantages[/underline]
In the manner in which the knowledge of
the two schools [deletion]was[/deletion] was acquired, there was
likewise a similar contrast -
The few [underline]discoveries[/underline] brought by Thales from
the East were applied and extended and the
method of [deletion]observation[/deletion] observation seems to
have been successfully used till the

persecution of [deletion]Anaxor[/deletion] [underline]Anaxargorus proved[/underline]
[underline]that it was dangerous openly to profess of[/underline]
[underline]the research for Physical truth[/underline]
In the Italic school on the contrary after
the first importation of useful learning all
novel enquirey seems to have been relinquished
And the later Pythagoreans appears to have
been inferior to their Master not only in
[underline]talents[/underline] but likewise in Knowledge.
He taught the roundness of the Earth -
Many of his followers asserted that it was
flat -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00008|dnp19c06pp|91026801[/page]

He had embraced [underline]the comprehensive[/underline] Theory
[underline]in which[/underline] the sun is placed in the
Centre and the Earth considered as revolving
round it and in which the fixed stars
are regarded as suns and the planets
as habitable worlds. -
but in less than a hundred years after
[underline]his death[/underline] the vulgar notion was revived -
The pride of ignorant men elevated by false
metaphysical speculation would not suffer them
to consider the Earth only as a small [deletion]body[/deletion] part
of the system of nature and themselves as
living atoms only in the scale of being:

No they restored the Globe to its ancient place of
dignity [underline]in[/underline] the centre of the [underline]universe[/underline] and
supposed the sun moon and stars as lights merely
suspended like lamps in the vault of heaven
for the use the conveniency and the amusement
of Man. -
That this account is autherised by history is
evident from the description given of the phy=
=thagorean philosophers of the [underline]Eleatic School[/underline] in
Sicily - such opinions are attributed to
[underline]Xenophanes[/underline] and [underline]Parmenides[/underline], both of whom
lived in the later part of the Age of [underline]Pericles[/underline]
And Xenophanes is said to have believed that
the stars like artificial fires were lighted
up every night and extinguished every

day and that they were supported by
exhalations from the Earth -
To detail the [insertion]physical[/insertion] [deletion]various[/deletion] notions of the
various sects who taught in the different
cities of Greece of Italy and of Sicily in
what may be called the middle Age of
Grecian civilization would to collect [deletion]toghe[/deletion]
together a medley of opinions in which a
few truths occur blended with numerous
errors and absurdities that of the philosophers
attempted [underline]universal systems[/underline]
And the supreme being and Man and
Nature were all considered as objects of
their enquiry

And in almost all researches they pursued
the same vague method of assuming a certain
principle and endeavouring to explain all facts
and all knowledge by applying it generally
and indiscriminately. -
Heracletus to produce one instance
perceiving the activity of fire in nature
its important effects and its vivifying agency
instead of collecting facts with regard to it in
the spirit of a true observer for the purpose
of ascertaining the general laws by which it
was governed -
P only assumed that it was the
principle of all things - And that Earth
and Air and water were only peculiar forms of
Heat -

And not contented with hasty and ridiculous
generalisation. He went still farther and supposed
it intelligent. and moving and living in all
nature.
In the opinions of Leucippus of Abdera who
flourished 428 years before Christ some novel views
were disclosed and a philosophy was taught
of a different character from that of the system
of the [underline]Pythagorean[/underline] or [underline]Ionic Schools[/underline]
Leucippus may be considered as the founder
of the [underline]corpuscular[/underline] system other persons before
had indeed attempted to show that matter
must be composed of very small or minute parts
but Leucippus endeavoured to establish that
such parts had definite figure and that

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00013|dnp19c11pp|91026806[/page]

they were endowed with powers of motion and
that all the varieties of life the forms of things
were produced by their arrangement and their
Combinations
- Democritus was the disciple of [underline]Leucippus[/underline]
and He extended the doctrine of his Master
He is recorded as a diligent observer He is stated
by all his Biographers to have been a great
and indefatigable traveller and one of them
has made him give an account of his Voyage
and labours.
Which account is [underline]of high Confidence[/underline]
[underline]demonstrates great talents[/underline] would prove
democritus to have been one of the first
of the Geniuses of [deletion]An[/deletion] Antiquity.

He is supposed to say I have spared no labour
in endeavouring to gain Knowledge - I have seen
all the great men of my Age. I have
journeyed through all countries in which I
had the most distant hope of discovering useful
truths. I have never been deterred by the
distance of places nor by dangers nor by
fears of danger. I have observed the
various differences of climates - I have
described the [deletion]phaen[/deletion] phenomena of the Air
the Earth and the waters - the fatague
of body has never disturbed the tranquility
of my mind and even during my travels
I have applied my self to quiet meditation

The cultivated mathematics whilst passing over
the public roads with as much success as if
I had been seated tranquilly in my chamber
And I believe that no person living can

I will not even except the priests of Egypt
Democritus is said to have written books
upon plants and animals and to have
pursued Anatomical and philosophical
investigations but none of his [deletion]obsa[/deletion] observations
upon natural bodies have been preserved
If we may credit some writers Democritus was
the first experimental chemist for it is said
that he was acquainted with methods for bringing
stone into solution and for ivory -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00016|dnp19c14pp|91026809[/page]

Democritus added to the system of Leucippus -
Void space and he supposed that all the agencies
of the corpuscles composing matter were exerted in
this space.
Many opinions were attributed [deletion]to this[/deletion] by some
historians to this philosopher which are referred
by others to Anaxagorus and even to Pythagoras
such was the notion that the Galaxy is
produced by a number of small stars and the
general idea of the plurality of Worlds
Many of the strong repostes likewise reported
by some writers to have belonged to Thales
and the Ionic philosophers have by others
been referred to Democritus -

And it would seem from the experience of
early as well as of late times that wit has
always been a rare quality; for there is hardly
one good thing which has not been attributed to
twenty different persons and the attic salt of
antiquity has often been stolen to give a
relish to modern productions -
Democritus was called the laughing Philosopher
and the reason for this appellation seems to be
that he ridiculed the Abderotis on account of
their stupidity and laughed at their follies
They in return accused him of Madness
and are said to have sent for Hippocrates
with the hope that he might effect a cure

[page]18|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00018|dnp19c16pp|91026811[/page]
16
The physician was astonished at the talents of
the philosopher and pronounced him the wisest
of them and his fellow citizens the greatest of
fools for not understanding the nature of
the treasure they possessed -
In an Epistle ascribed to Hippocrates an
account is given of [deletion]his given[/deletion] of his interview
with Democritus a statement is made of the
reason of the philosopher for laughing at the
absurdities
These reasons are delivered in a strong
and energetic style and exhibit a very
perfect picture of a depraved and [unclear]proper[/unclear]
I laugh Democritus is made to say
I laugh at their follies and their

[page]19|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00019|dnp19c17pp|91026812[/page]
17
inconsistences I laugh at their wickedness and
presumption. I laugh as Man the most
wonderful and most insignificant the most
exalted and debased the best and yet the
most depraved of beings
Democritus there is every reason to believe
was a man of considerable talents who perceived
the necessity of experimental methods for
advancing the sciences; but living amongst
a people who despised his labours and enquiries
it was scarcely possible for him to produce
any important or permanent effect
The Age was wholly unprepared for the
devellopement of [underline]great natural truths[/underline]
and [underline]the study[/underline] a consolation and a delight

[page]20|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00020|dnp19c18pp|91026813[/page]
18
to the person who followed it appears to have
had very little effect upon the pursuits of the
public and very little relation to their opinion
The general idea of the various substances
being formed by the union of primitive
particles of matter differing in their form and
arrangements has been adapted by a number
of modern philosophers: but the present system
differs altogether from the ancient system
in this respect: [underline]that these particles[/underline] are [deletion]supposed[/deletion]
supposed to be acted on either by [underline]repulsion[/underline]
or attraction according as the circumstances
of their contiguity are different. -
The modern corpuscular philosophy however
even in its best form can only be considered

[page]21|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00021|dnp19c19pp|91026814[/page]
19
as a mere hypothesis and the ancient doctrine in
which the arrangement of the atoms were supposed
to be was absolutely absurd. -
Chemical experiments which have made us
acquainted with the [deletion]several[/deletion] [insertion]sensible[/insertion] elements of bodies
prove that amidst the infinite variety of the
combinations producible by human Art very
few are similar to those [underline]existing in nature.[/underline]
And where ever the principle of life is
[underline]concerned[/underline] there affinity or elementary
attractions appears no longer as a primary
power but is submitted to a more active and
energetic principle -
Every fact speaks to a distinct language
the harmony of the arrangements existing
in Nature and their necessity for the preservation

[page]22|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00022|dnp19c20pp|91026815[/page]
20
of life and the phenomena can in no way
be accounted for by any effects of material
agency but evidently derive their existence
and their order from supreme wisdom
and intelligence and the vanity of
opinions amongst the ancient speculators
with regard to the causes of things serve
to demonstrate the necessity of immutable
law and of a positive institution for
guiding the reason and for directing
opinion. -
The Era of Democritus was likewise that
of Socrates -
And no philosopher amongst the Ancients
ever [underline]enjoyed[/underline] a [underline]higher[/underline] [underline]and more durable[/underline]

[page]23|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00023|dnp19c21pp|91026816[/page]
21
[underline]reputation than this great Man[/underline]
When Socrates [underline]first[/underline] began to teach in [underline]Athens[/underline]
the great attention of the [underline]Schools[/underline] was employed
upon abstracted questions and the Minds of
the Sophists [underline]were deluded[/underline] and led astray by
the grandeur and sublimity of objects which
it was impossible for them ever to comprehend
Having surveyed only a very small part of the
universe they professed to understand the
mechanism of the whole and in this Age [deletion]scarcely[/deletion]
scarcely a relic of the doctrines of Anaxagoras
or of the truths of the Pythagorean school
[underline]was preserved[/underline] in the theories which were
[underline]metaphysical[/underline] vague and inconsistent
It was against this idle method of forming
vain hypothesis that Socrates raised his voice

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00024|dnp19c22pp|91026817[/page]
22
and endeavoured to persuade the Greeks to
recall to the Earth their philosophy which
had been lost in the Clouds. -
It has been sometimes supposed that this
great man despised physical science and
considered it as of no value
This does however seem to be wholly
false for we Know that he was ridiculed
on account of his experiments and was
represented by Aristophanes as passing his
time in studying meteors and the phenomena
of Air and in making geographical
observations and pursuing researches on the
properties of burning glasses
Socrates undoubtedly saw the miserable
imperfection of the plans of study adopted

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00025|dnp19c23pp|91026818[/page]
23
by the speculation surrounding him and the
whole of his advice seems to have been directed
with the view of inducing them to confine
[underline]themselves[/underline] to things certainly in their reach
[underline]not to[/underline] attempt to pass beyond the limits marked
out for the Knowledge by the senses
And to study those objects surrounding them
and to reduce them to laws before they [deletion]launched[/deletion]
launched into the chaos of conjecture and
into the dim region of possibilities -
Socrates fell a sacrifice to the boldness of his opinion
and the unsubdued strength of his virtue -
And it was whilst lamenting his death that Plato
endeavoured to display the spirit of the System and
to collect the doctrines that had been delivered by
his master

[page]26|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00026|dnp19c24pp|91026819[/page]
24
Socrates left no writings.
The first and greatest of his disciples has supplied
this defect but there is some reason to believe that
the poetical fancy of plato has ornamented and
changed the didactic reasoning of Socrates. -
Plato has entered very little upon the subject
of physical science and in his [underline]Timeas[/underline] the
only dialogue expressly upon the subject [underline]very[/underline]
[underline]little[/underline] valuable information; but [underline]very much[/underline]
obscure speculation may be found -
The charm of this writer is his adorned
and beautiful stile, in which an imagination
bold and yet correct constantly appears -
Plato in his compositions displays the
highest degree of Art -

[page]27|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00027|dnp19c25pp|91026820[/page]
25
No man knew better how to relieve the tediousness
of Philosophical discussion by chearful and brilliant
Coloring, by happy and dignified incidents or
by pathetic and sublime traits of Character
It has been said of his language by a great
orator of antiquity that it seemed to be rather
that of a divinity than of a man, and the
durability of its effect, is perhaps the strongest
testimony of its real excellence.
The poetical beauties of his works have neither
been tarnished by time nor by the revolutions of
opinion and it is in consequence of these beauties
perhaps that the visionary ideas which often form
the foundations of his Systems have been so
[underline]favourably[/underline] received;
And that the constant misapplication of principles
[underline]has been tolerated[/underline] that misapplication which

[page]28|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00028|dnp19c26pp|91026821[/page]
26
Socrates had so much censured, but from which
He could not preserve his most distinguished Scholar
The dialogues of Plato appear to have been often
mere amusements of his imagination, and it is
[deletion]imposible[/deletion] imposssible not to wonder that they should
have proceeded from a man who considered Geometry
as the most sublime of the sciences, and who
inscribed on the Door of his School that it was
open for none but Geometricians -
It may however be said that plato never
speaks in those productions in his own person
but details the opinions of the Philosophers who
had preceded him - He ballances opinions,
He discusses and analyses Hypotheses, and generally
leaves the mind in perfect indecision and
[underline]in ignorance[/underline] of the part that He himself had
taken in the question

[page]29|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00029|dnp19c27pp|91026822[/page]
27
The of the dialogues |_ however |_ whatever view
may be taken is of a [underline]much higher[/underline] Character than the
[underline]Knowledge[/underline], and it is impossible not to regret that
such [underline]great talents[/underline] were thrown away upon subjects
often of mere amusement and without utility or
any durable interest -
All the truly valuable discoveries that remain of
this distinguished man relates to mathematics
And in this department of science He certainly made
great progress which is the more astonishing when
the vividness of his fancy and the playful wildness
of his Mind are considered. -
It was in the School of [underline]Plato[/underline] that the most
celebrated mathematicians of Antiquity were formed
and that the rudiments of the methods were
produced by which [underline]in those later times[/underline] the great
phenomena of the universe have been explained
and the laws of the motions of the Earth and
the Heavenly bodies ascertained

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00030|dnp19c28pp|91026823[/page]
28
- [underline]Aristotle[/underline] was the disciple of Plato, but the
character of his philosophy is wholly unlike that
of his master -
Plato attempted to raise science to the high flights
of poetry - Aristotle on the contrary endeavoured
to bring poesy to fixed rules and to explain
the principles of eloquence. -
The philosopher of Stagyra [underline]truly conceived[/underline]
that one method was applicable to all the
departments of human knowledge but unfortunately
for the progress of science He himself did not
employ [underline]the true method[/underline] He began with
generalizations and attempted to descend to
particulars and hence his conclusions were
almost always modified according to a
preconceived Theory.

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00031|dnp19c29pp|91026824[/page]
29
The comprehensive mind and the extensive talents
of Aristotle were employed upon all the subjects
of practical or speculative investigation and
when the range that He took is considered we
ought rather to wonder that He discovered truth
at all than to be su[deletion]p[/deletion]prised that He discovered
it so rarely.
The [underline]physics[/underline] of Aristotle are perhaps the least
instructive of his works for He was not an
experimenter, and He was seldom contented to
adopt the opinions of Men who had gone
before him -
He has given very few correct explanations
and his notions on causes are perhaps less accurate
than those adopted in the Early Schools of Greece
Aristotle asserted that the world was eternal
that the expanse of the sky was [deletion]spherical[/deletion]

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00032|dnp19c30pp|91026825[/page]
30
Spherical that the Earth was immortal and that the
stars were a part of the heavens and moving
only within the sphere in which they were fixd.
In Aristotles abstracted principles with regard to
the properties of matter there was a greater
opportunity for him to exert his powerful talents
And upon these subjects some of his notions
were tolerably correct. Thus He had an idea
of gravity as an uniform property of matter
and He contrasts it with levity, by which there
is some reason to suppose He meant a repulsive
force -
He conceived that the elements of bodies
were unknown to us in their real state and
that we were acquainted only with their
compounds -
And on this notion He produced his
Theory of actual and possible existence

[page]33|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00033|dnp19c31pp|91026826[/page]
31
in which He conceived an essential species of matter
capable of assuming a great variety of forms
The most important of the works of Aristotle
in Natural Science is his history of Animals -
Here He found it impossible to indulge in vague
conjecture and his patience in registering minute
observations on this occasion is the most admirable
as his mind had generally been applied only to
the discovery of grand and striking analogies
Aristotle was assisted by the riches and power
of his scholar [underline]Alexander the Great[/underline] in the collection
of the specimens for this [underline]work in Natural History[/underline]
And it has been supposed by some Writers that
the Macedonian Conqueror in patronizing Aristotle
had in view the real increase and diffusion of
Knowledge -

[page]34|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00034|dnp19c32pp|91026827[/page]
32
It has been supposed that He had formed
brilliant and comprehensive for civilizing the
Regions that He conquered and for spreading
the light of knowledge the benefit of Arts
from the west to the East from Greece to
every part of the Globe.
These ideas however certainly are delusive
Such bright visions might occasionally have
passed through his lofty and glowing Mind
but every trait of his Character proves that
the motive for all his great exertions was
an ungovernable Ambition an insatible
lust of power
To satisfy these His short life was devoted to
war and bloodshed and to satisfy these other
men were considered only as machines to
fulfil his purposes or to be sacrifised to
accomplish his views. -

[page]35|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00035|dnp19c33pp|91026828[/page]
33
He cultivated letters but [insertion]then[/insertion] it was from the desire of being
thought in all things and his address to
Aristotle on the publication of his works proves that He
had [insertion]no[/insertion] noble and abstracted love of truth and that
selfishness and vanity were the feelings that induced
him to promote the interests of learned Men.
Why have you published your works He says -
to wherein shall We be great if the learning in
which we were educated be made common to all -
And I wish to excell [underline]others[/underline] as much in Knowledge
as in power -
Theophrastus was the successor of Aristotle in
the Lyceum and none of the ancients seem to
have studied Natural science with so much effect
I entered very fully upon his character in the
Geological lectures.
And I shall not run the risque of fatiguing
by goin over the same ground the second time

[page]36|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00036|dnp19c34pp|91026829[/page]
34
This illustrious Character can scarcely be praised
[underline]too much[/underline] but were I to dwell long on his merits
you would perhaps think that He might be
praised too often -
The speculative doctrines which issued from the
Schools of Plato and Aristotle from the academy
and the Lyceum continued nearly for 1800 Years
to occupy and agitate the minds of men and
their influence was felt from the confines of
Arabia to the extremity of Europe -
Men of warm feelings and vivid passions in
whom the imagination was more active than their
reason were most disposed to adopt the enthusiastic
Theories stamped by the ardor of a [underline]poetic mind[/underline]
Persons of sounder and cooler judgments of a
turn for rigid criticism became attached to the
opinions and to the cyllogistic methods of
the stagyrite and the two systems for a long

[page]37|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00037|dnp19c35pp|91026830[/page]
35
while divided between them the empire of the mind
Their influence was various both constantly
propagated errors and often assisted prejudice;
but they produced good effects by calling forth
the powers of men and by inducing them to
combat what appeared false opinion and they
[deletion]and[/deletion] preserved the activity of the faculties through
an age of darkness and ignorance -
They made men acquainted with the forms of
reasoning. and when the authority of the
chair had passed away the method of discussion
which had long been applied to non entities was
made use of for explaining realities and the
doctrines of the scholars were overturned by
weapons which they themselves had formed
and truth was elevated at the same time
error was destroyed -

[page]38|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00038|dnp19c36pp|91026831[/page]
36
At the time the great contests were taking
place between the successor of Alexander and at
the turbulent period when so many different
empires were formed and destroyed there flourished
nevertheless several illustrious men who in particular
departments of Science whent far beyond all the
philosophers of older time. -
Experience principally acquired seemed in
this Age to have convinced men that their powers
were limited; that they were capable of compassing
only a certain number of objects; and that
great and permanent excellence was only to be
attained by continued study and by labourious
application to the multiform combination of [underline]a[/underline]
few things -
Archimedes flourished about 220 [insertion]years[/insertion] B.C and
He devoted the whole of his time [underline]and applied[/underline]
the [underline]whole force[/underline] of his mind to the study
of the moving properties of bodies and to

[page]39|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00039|dnp19c37pp|91026832[/page]
37
the explanation of them by [underline]numbers[/underline] and
[underline]geometrical forms[/underline] -
This genius appears to have been of the
first order and His discoveries are [deletion]abundant[/deletion]
undoubtedly the most splendid belonging to antiqu[superscript]ity[/superscript]
He first ascertained the nature of the mechaniean
powers and the laws of Hydrostatics -
He constructed the first planetarium
He was acquainted with the powers of burning
mirrors and we owe to his talents some of the
highest refinements of the methods of [deletion]mathematical[/deletion]
Mathematical investigation
The effects of the inventions of Archimedes
were such as we are even unable to produce
in modern times
An interesting account is given by [deletion]Plutar[superscript]ch[/superscript][/deletion]
plutarch in his life of Marcellus" of their
effects in the defence of Syracuse against the

38
The history is very interesting and contains many
curious particulars of the studies of this great
man and some refined observations on [underline]his[/underline]
[underline]Character -[/underline]
The subject is treated with a freshness of
memory and so striking a delineation of
incident that I shall venture to read a long
extract.
Here upon Marcellus marched with his
whole army and encamped before Syracuse
Appius Claudius commanding the land forces
and himself the fleet, which consisted of sixty
galleys of five banks of oars full of alsorts
of arms and missive weapons. Besides these
He had a prodigious machine carried upon
eighty galleys fastened together;
With which He approached the walls relying

[page]41|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00041|dnp19c39pp|91026834[/page]
39
on the number of his batteries and other
instruments of war as well as on his own
great Character -
But Archimedes despised all this and
confided in the [deletion]superiority[/deletion] superiority of his
engines;
Though He did not think the inventing of them
an object worthy of his serious studies but [underline]only[/underline]
[underline]reckoned them[/underline] among the [underline]amusements[/underline] of
[underline]geometry[/underline]
Nor had He gone so far but at the pressing
instance of King Hiero who entreated him to turn
his art from abstracted notions to matters of sense
and to make his reasoning more intelligible to
the generality of Mankind by applying them
to the uses of Common life
which could not be demonstrated in the way
of Theorem by sensible experiments and by
the use of instruments.

[page]42|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00042|dnp19c40pp|91026835[/page]

In consequence of this application Archimedes
told the [person]person_911|King[/person] that [insertion]He[/insertion] would prove his talents and
aserted that with a given power he could move
any given weight whatever; Nay it is said from
the confidence He had in his demonstration he
ventured to give scope to his fancy and to affirm
that if he had an insulated spot on which
his feet could be fixed he would move the
earth out of its place.
Hiero full of wonder begged of him to evince the
truth of his notions by moving some great weight
with a small [deletion]body[/deletion] power -
In compliance with which Archimedes caused
one of the Kings Galleys to be drawn on shore
with [deletion]as[/deletion] many hands and much labour.
and having well manned her and put on board
her usual loading, He place himself at a
distance and without any pains, only

[page]43|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00043|dnp19c41pp|91026836[/page]
41
moving with his hand the end of a machine which
consisted of a variety of ropes and pulleys he drew
her to him in as gentle and smooth a manner as
if she had been under sail.
The [person]person_911|King[/person] quite astonished when he saw the force
of his art prevailed [deletion]with him[/deletion] with Archimedes to
make for him all manner of engines and machines
which could be used either for attack or defence
in a siege -
This however he never employed of the greatest
part of his reign being blest with tranquility; but
they were extremely servicable to the [deletion]Sary[/deletion] Syracusian
on the present occasion when with such a number
of machines they had the inventor to direct them
by his talents and genius at the time that
the Romans first attacked them both by sea and
[deletion]by[/deletion] land, they were struck dumb with terror
imagining they could not possibly resist such
numerous forces and so furious an assault,

[page]44|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00044|dnp19c42pp|91026837[/page]
42
But Archimedes soon began to play his engines
and they shot against the land forces alsorts of
Missive weapons and stones of an enormous size
with so incredible noise and rapidity that nothing
could resist them; they overturned and crushed
whatever came in their way and spread terrible
disorder through the ranks
on the side towards the sea were erected vast
machines putting forth on a sudden over the
walls huge beams with necessary tackle and striking
with a prodigious force on the enemys Galleys
sunk them at once -
While other ships hoisted up by the prows
by iron grapples or hooks like the beaks of Cranes
and set on end on the stern were plunged
to the bottom of the Sea; and others again
by ropes and grapples were drawn towards
the shore and after being whirled about and

[page]45|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00045|dnp19c43pp|91026838[/page]
43
and dashed against the rocks that projected
below the walls were broken to pieces and the
crews perished
Very often a ship was lifted as high above the sea
and suspended in the air there it swung till
the men were thrown out by the violence of
the motion and then it dashed against the walls.
As for the great machine which Marcellus
brought forward upon eight galleys whilst
it was at a considerable distance from the walls
Archimedes discharged a stone of ten talents weight
and after that a second and a third all
which striking upon it with an amazing
noise and force shattered and totally disjointed
it
Marcellus in this distress drew off all his galleys
as fast as possible and sent orders to the land forces
to retreat likewise,

[page]46|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00046|dnp19c44pp|91026839[/page]
44
He then called a council of war in which it was
resolved to come close to the walls, if it were possible
next morning before day.
For Archimedes engines they thought being very
strong and intended to act at a considerable distance
would then discharge themselves over their heads; and
if they were pointed at them when they were so near
would have no effect.
But for this Archimedes [underline]had been[/underline] long [underline]prepared[/underline]
having by him engines fitted to all distances with
suitable weapons and shorter beams.
Besides, He had caused holes to be made in the walls
in which he had placed scorpions that did not carry
far but could be discharge very fast and by these
the enemy was galled without knowing whence
the weapon came.
When therefore the Romans were got close to
the [underline]undiscovered as[/underline] they [underline]thought[/underline], they were
[unclear][/unclear]

exceeds even the hundred handed giants in the fable
And in truth all the rest of the syracusans were
no more than the body of the batteries of Archimedes
while He himself was the animating soul
All other weapons lay idle and unemployed
his were the only offensive and defensive arm of
the City.
At length the Romans were so terrified that if
they saw but a rope or a stick put over the walls
they cried out that Archimedes was levelling
some machine at them and turned their backs
and fled.
Marcellus seeing this gave up all thoughts
of proceeding by assault and leaving the matter
to time turned the siege into a blockade.
Yet Archimedes had such a depth of understan
such a dignity of sentiment and so copious a fund
of Mathematical Knowledge that though in the
invention of these machines He gained the
reputation of a man endowed with divine

[page]49|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00049|dnp19c47pp|91026842[/page]
47
rather than human knowledge yet he did
not vouchsafe to leave any account of them in
writing
For He considered all attention to mechanics
and every art that ministers to common uses as
mean and sordid, and placed his whole delight
in those intellectual [underline]speculations[/underline] which
without any relation [underline]to the necessities[/underline] of life
have an intrinsic excellence arising from
abstracted truth and demonstration.
Indeed if mechanical knowledge is valuable
for the curious frame and amazing power of
those machines which it produces
The other infinitely exccels on account of
its invincible force and conviction.
And certain it is that abstruse and profoun[insertion]d[/insertion]
questions in geometry are no where solved by
a more simple process and upon clearer
principles than in the writing of Archimedes

[page]50|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00050|dnp19c48pp|91026843[/page]
48
Some ascribe this to the acuteness of his
genius, and others to his indefatigable
industry by which He made things that cost
a great deal of pains appear unlaboured
and easy.
In fact it is almost impossible for a man
of himself to find out the demonstration of his
propositions but as soon as he is taught it he
will think he could have done it without assistance
By such a ready and easy way does he lead
us to what he wants to prove
We are not to regret as incredible what is
related of him that being perpetually charmed
by a domestic syren that is his geometry he
neglected his meat and drink and took no care
of his person; that he was often carried by force
to the baths and when there he would make
mathematical figures in the ashes; and with
his finger draw lines upon his body

when it was anointed so much was he transported
with intellectual delight such an Enthusiast in
science.
About the that Archimedes was gaining for
himself unrivalled glory: the School of Natural
Science in Alexandria flourished in its greatest
splendor. -
By the magnificence of the Potolemies an [deletion]extensiv[/deletion]
extensive [deletion]librena[/deletion] [place]place_187|library[/place] was established and the
greeks were invited from every part of the world
to assist the progress of investigation
It was in Alexandria that Euclid collected
and improved the elements of Mathematics that
at present bear his name and which are so perfect
as to be perhaps incapable of improvement and
which present one of the few finished productions
of the human mind

[page]52|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00052|dnp19c50pp|91026845[/page]
50
It was in the school of Alexandria that
Aristarchus endeavoured to revive the idea
the notion of the earth - and to measure the
distance of the Sun and He concluded that
this luminary was about 20 times farther
from us than the Moon an estimation [deletion]though[/deletion]
which though incorrect still enlarged the ideas
of men with regard to the extent of the
Universe.
Eratosthenes who succeeded Aristarchus
followed a similar path of observation and
ascertained the obliquity of the Ecliptic at
that time a discovery [underline]of the utmost importance[/underline]
for the progress of the Science

[page]53|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00053|dnp19c51pp|91026846[/page]
51
But of all the Astronomers of Alexandria Hipparchus -
was the person who made the greatest number of
observations
He formed the first table of the Sun - He determined
the time of the revolution of the Moon and ascertain[insertion]d[/insertion]
the nature of her orbit.
And He made a labourious catalogue of the fixed
stars which seems to have been executed with the
greatest accuracy and precision
Potolemy the last philosopher of the Greek
school of Alexandria flourished about 200 years
after Hipparchus - in the 130 year of the Christian
era - He collected all the observations of his
predecessor and added to them a number of new
ones - He endeavoured to establish a system of
planetary motions by supposing the Earth in
the centre and the sun the moon and the
stars revolving round it

[page]54|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00054|dnp19c52pp|91026847[/page]
52
but though this part of his doctrine is
incorrect yet his account of the phenomena
is elegant and precise -
Potolemy attempted in his Almagest a
complete theory of astronomy - It still exists
and is one of the most precious of the monumen[insertion]ts[/insertion]
of Antiquity -
[underline]The ideas[/underline] which he adopted were current
for nearly 1400 years - late discoveries have
proved them to be erroneous; but it must not
be forgotten that they led the moderns to the
investigation of truth and that they were
in the dark ages the only foundation
of the science. -

[page]55|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00055|dnp19c53pp|91026848[/page]
53
From the general tenour of what has been advanced
and particularly from all the later instances it
is evident that whenever the greek Philosophers
were contented with reasoning upon their observati[insertion]ons[/insertion]
the results of Theory obtained were always opposite
and often grand and conformable to the facts
of nature; but in their speculations that remain
concerning the general system of things no
distinct or extensive truths ever occur and the
semblances of truths in their hypotheses seem
rather to have been the result of accident
than of any peculiarity or the correctness of
[deletion]by which[/deletion] the method by which the were formed
- Still however [underline]their[/underline] views of [underline]material[/underline] existence
I mean the views [underline]of their most[/underline] distinguished
[underline]masters[/underline] often present a sublimity of thought
and a grandeur of expression which demonstrate

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00056|dnp19c54pp|91026849[/page]
54
the warm imagination and the power of the mind
by which they were created - |_ We may purcieve
in them a character which marks the ardour
of curiosity and the restlessness of lofty [underline]Genius[/underline]
[underline]which[/underline] despising the slow methods of acquiring
knowledge offered by the senses by minute [deletion]observa[/deletion]
observations and laborious experiment endeavours
to approve its unassisted strength to obstacles and
difficulties; and unable either to lift up or
to rend the veil that conceals the Mysteries
of Nature and exhausted by its own efforts
[underline]sleeps[/underline] and dreams that it has penetrated
even into the very sanctuary of her temper. -
The perfection of the execution of the
philosophical literature of the Greeks likewise
has a claim to our high admiration.

[page]57|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00057|dnp19c55pp|91026850[/page]
55
The refinement of their taste is demonstrated by
the [underline]graces[/underline] of their stile by its dignity
simplicity, and energy.
No people perhaps ever understood [underline]so distinctly[/underline]
the principles of the sublime the beautiful
the decorous -
The principles appear even in [deletion]their[/deletion]
their [deletion]arroneous[/deletion] erroneous sientific Histories and
shine forth amidst the obscurity of error and
of doubt - and give an interest and an effect
to combinations of thoughts which otherwise would
have appeared triffling and [deletion]inseg[/deletion] insignificant
In their descriptions and even in their analogies
every thing is chaste and properly disposed no
meretricious Arts are adopted - no attempts are made
to enhance the sublime or the beautiful by causing
it to follow [underline]the ludicrous[/underline] -

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00058|dnp19c56pp|91026851[/page]
56
no efforts are made to blend together incongruous
forms for the mere amusement of the fancy
Elegance and decorum and greatness are the
elements of the interest they produce:
And the remains of the sientific systems of the
greeks like the ruins of their magnificent
edifices must excite atonishment and admiration
even though their systems were formed by false
speculations though their temples were devoted
to Idolatry. -
The perfection of the language of Greece
might at first view be considered as having
been rather favourable than detrimental to
the progress of physical Science: but a
correct examination of the subject I am
inclined to believe would [deletion]ad[/deletion] lead to [deletion]the[/deletion] a
different opinion the enquiry is one of
great importance and it surely will not

[page]59|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00059|dnp19c57pp|91026852[/page]
57
be improper to enter upon some general views
with regard to it on this occasion -
Every language is in its simplest state either
an expression of feelings or of things and all
the words belonging to it in their original
construction are that signify simple objects
or simple Ideas.
Abstractions are only gradually formed
when one word is made to imply a number of
other [underline]words which[/underline] themselves denote things
and it is on abstractions or general terms
that all scientific proposition depends
When accurate [underline]views[/underline] are [deletion]taken[/deletion] represented
in general [underline]proportions[/underline] there is always an
immediate recurrence to the simpler words
that they represent and hence the appeal [underline]is[/underline]
[underline]to relations of facts[/underline] and the feelings of assent

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00060|dnp19c58pp|91026853[/page]
58
or dissent when first formed and founded upon
the distinct [underline]connections[/underline] of [underline]words[/underline] and things
But in the progress of the [deletion]acquisition[/deletion]
acquisition and the use of language after
a certain number of propositions are
understood they become axioms and are
employed for conveniency and expedition
independently of facts as methods of opinion
It is on this circumstance that the most
refined of our reasons are formed.
and that the great use of language as
an instrument of thought depends -
But it is likewise on this circumstance
that a number of erroneous conclusions
of prejudices and of false theories are
established and cloaked as it were in

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00061|dnp19c59pp|91026854[/page]
59
the forms which ought only to express truth
when the natural order of association is
[underline]strictly followed[/underline] no mistakes can arise from
the use of general propositions
but when abstracted words have been
exceedingly multiplied it becomes deficient
to define the[deletion]ir[/deletion] true signification of all
and yet from their having been employed
habitually, they produce a great effect upon
the mind and become connected with strong
and vivid feelings.
All the physical writings of the greeks
demonstrate that terms of this kind without
any distinct meaning had continually [deletion]accum[/deletion]
accumulated in their language and that in
proportion even as it became more [deletion]harmon[/deletion]
harmonious more energetic and more copious

[page]62|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00062|dnp19c60pp|91026855[/page]
60
Applied to the phenomena of nature they
were often made the foundations of theories;
and where the [underline]primitive materials[/underline] were
of so loose and incoherent a species it necessarily
followed that the superstructure however
beautiful [underline]or grand[/underline] never possesses solidity
or convenience or permanency. -
The correctness the excellency of the style
of the most eminent of the grecian Philosophers
are worthy of our highest praise and deserving
our zealous imitation
But never may we desert the sublime
methods of [person]person_124|Bacon[/person] and of Newton for the rules
of the speculative philosophy developed by
Plato and Aristotle never may we relinquish
the pure [deletion]troths[/deletion] truths of modern science
which are images of nature for the

[page]63|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00063|dnp19c61pp|91026856[/page]
61
speculations of Elder times which are the fancies
of men
In all cases in science it is our business
to analyse every principle and to ascertain
to what expressions of facts it relates or to
what simpler laws it may be referred -
It is our duty to separate propositions from
[deletion]human[/deletion] human passions and to reason on
them as mere representation of things and
to employ no terms that are either perplexed
or doubtful or uncommon
The same processes of thought ever will
apply in common life as in science -
experience must be our only guide - Experience
or [underline]moral feeling[/underline] founded on accurate and
distinct knowledge

[page]64|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00064|dnp19c62pp|91026857[/page]
62
Words alone must never be suffered to satisfy
or fill the mind and their relations to
facts must be ascertained before they can be
considered either of importance or of use
The imagination must be subjected
to the judgment or rather they must naturally
operate and assist and correct each other.
We may be always safely entertained by wit
We may always be safely delighted by eloquence
for they are the [underline]life[/underline] and the [underline]organs[/underline] of the
mind: -
But never let us consider wit as argument
or eloquence as truth till we have cooly
examined them by the test of right [underline]reason[/underline]
for this is the only certain guide of

[page]65|MS-DAVY-11903-000-00065|dnp19c63pp|91026858[/page]

[underline]opinion[/underline] a principle the same in all
ages and in all matters independent
of fashion or caprice unchanging
immortal. -
