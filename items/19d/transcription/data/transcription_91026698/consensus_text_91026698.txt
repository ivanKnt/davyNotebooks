- To Minds of sensibility it was scarcely
possible that there should not be
[underline]an appeal of facts[/underline] with regard
to [underline]the order of Nature[/underline]; they
saw [underline]Nature[/underline] smiling under the
[underline]influence of the Sunbeams[/underline],
life arising as if spontaneously
in all its forms; they beheld
a continued principle of production
acting in all the Kingdoms
of Nature & the whole of
the surface; - the breeze, the
dews & the gentle rain [deletion]in[/deletion]
all these ideas in Minds of
sensibility, must necessarily have
combined.
