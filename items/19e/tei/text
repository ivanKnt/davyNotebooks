The love of Knowledge and of intellectual<lb/>
power is a faculty belonging to the human mind<lb/>
in every state of society; and it is one by which<lb/>
it is most justly characterized: one the most<lb/>
worthy of being cultivated and extended.<lb/>
Useful to the individual and even necessary<lb/>
to his existance<lb/>
Its general effects upon the species are in<lb/>
the highest degree important and beneficial;<lb/>
and the improvements in the condition and in<lb/>
the happiness of mankind appear in all<lb/>
instances to have preserved an uniform pace<lb/>
with the progress of the inventions of<lb/>
the Arts and the advancement in the<lb/>
sciences. -<lb/>
