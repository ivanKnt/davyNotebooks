hopes of wild presumption and in a
sound understanding the conviction of

produces discretion and caution which
daily become more [underline]habitual[/underline] which

become the foundation of a just

the better are its effects no efforts
made for the attainment of truth
ought to be slighted [underline]Lofty and[/underline]
[underline]high ideas[/underline] are often connected}
