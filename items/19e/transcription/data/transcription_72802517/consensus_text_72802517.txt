{and who being in possession of a [underline][underline]light[/underline][/underline]
chuses [underline][underline]rather[/underline][/underline] to employ it for dazzling
the eyes of others than to use it for
his own [underline]Guidance[/underline]-
-[underline]That persons[/underline] who are only beginning
[underline]to attend to[/underline] the principles of [underline]science[/underline]
often over[insertion]r[/insertion]ate their acquirements
[underline]and abilities[/underline] cannot [underline]be denied[/underline]:
But this is a [underline]circumstance[/underline] of very little
importance and seldom of much
permanence
In every well regulated mind
false confidence cannot be of any long
duration vanity almost always
carries with it a certain [underline]cure[/underline]}
