{in science, and in such a refined period
as that in which [underline]we live[/underline] it is scarcely
possible that such a folly can flourish-
What is sometimes called pedantry
indeed may depend upon the ignorance
of the many as compared with the
knowledge of the few
But the moment the language of
science becomes the common language
of refined society every feeling of this
kind must cease -
And till that event takes place
the person must be very defficient in
common sense, who eneavours to
astonish by a parade of knowledge}
