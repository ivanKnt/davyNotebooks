{All the discoveries all the works of [underline]human[/underline]
[underline]Genius[/underline] are of great importance to the
community; but that their full [underline]effects[/underline]
may be produced; it is necessary that
the public mind [underline]be prepared to[/underline]
[underline]enjoy them[/underline] and to estimate their
advantages
The dew and the fertilizing
rain may descend from heaven but
unless the soil on which it falls
is well cultivated and the seed carefully
sown the harvest may be expected
in vain
The general diffusion of letters
and Philosophy is necessary to the
progress of the [underline]higher invention[/underline] of
[underline]the mind[/underline]}
