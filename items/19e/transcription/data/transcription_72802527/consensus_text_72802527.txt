{And there is scarcely any other weapon
than ridicule proper to be employed
the advocates of this mean doctrine
most of whom regard nothing as worthy
attention what they cannot eat or drink
most of whom would consider the invention
of a new [underline]sauce[/underline] as of more importance
than the discovery of a novel principle
in Natural Philosophy or the [deletion]constr[/deletion]
construction of an improved mouse trap
as more interesting than the production
of a sublime Poem}
