{for preventing any of its parts from
falling into decay -
And knowledge is like a [underline]river[/underline] which
unless it springs are constantly supplied
soon becomes exhausted and ceases to flow
on and to fertilize
- [underline]The mind[/underline] requires [underline]novelty[/underline] even as a
stimulus to exertions:
And the [deletion]Author[/deletion] Philosopher who has made
a discovery in natural [underline]science[/underline]; or the
Author of a [underline]work of Genius[/underline], in Art or in
literature is a [underline]Benefactor[/underline] not only to the
present generation but likewise to future
ages; for He gratifies that faculty of
[underline]enjoyment[/underline] which is pure and intellectual
and which must be more exalted in
proportion as society becomes more improved}
