No person who understands the luxury of the
table will assert that a sheep rendered
uncommonly fat on rich pasture or on turnips
is better or [underline]more luxurious food[/underline] than one
that grazed on the aromatic herbage of the
mountains;
but in the attempt to produce this well
fed animal which perhaps gains the prize
at smithfield a number of others have
been improved to a less extent and rendered
in consequence more adapted to common
use and the high price of well fed cattle
has awakened the [underline]feeling of emulation[/underline]
amongst [deletion]the[/deletion] Farmers. -}
