{The elegant models of the Etruscan
vases produced by the ingenuity of the
late excellent M[superscript]r[/superscript] Wedgwood may be said
to have no immediate application to
common uses; but yet in consequence of
their invention a spirit of immitation
and of emulation has operated upon
every branch of the porcelain manufacture
and even the form and composition
of our common pitchers and [underline]our common[/underline]
[underline]flower pots[/underline] in consequence have [underline]been[/underline]
[underline]improved[/underline] -.
In certain departments of industry
still greater advantages result from
the constant attempts to attain the
highest degree of excellence.-}
