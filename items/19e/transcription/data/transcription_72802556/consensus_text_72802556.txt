{It was at the beginning of this period that
literature and science made their first
progress in greece -
And at the time that they were studied
with the greatest ardour the patriotic spirit
and the Heroical virtues of the People
were revealed in their full splendour.
It was at the beginning of this period
when Anaxagoras was instructing the youth
of Athens in speculative Philosophy: when
Hippocrates was laying the foundations of
medical science- when Democritus was
pursuing the paths of experimental enquiry
It was at the same time that the minds of
the Inhabitants of Attica were kindling with
the poetic feeling raised by the immortal
[underline]genius of Homer[/underline]}
