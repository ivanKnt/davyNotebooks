{cannot indeed be denied; but a few facts
derived from the History of empires of
Antiquity will distinctively shew: that the
influence of the Arts and sciences in great
and wealthy states tends rather to depress
than to [underline]promote common luxury[/underline]: and that
[underline]those[/underline] periods, the most distinguished by
elevation of moral character by the social
virtues and by the higher feelings of the
soul; were likewise the periods in which
Philosophy and letters were most cultivated
and in which the fine Arts were [underline]ardently[/underline]
pursued -
The most happy period of grecian civil=
=ization is that included between the first
[underline]persian[/underline] and the second [underline]peloponnesian[/underline]
[underline]War[/underline] - -}
