{[deletion]Between[/deletion]
Between the Earth wildly and spontaneously
producing food- and grounds made fertil only
by human labour. -
Between the vices miseries and dependance
of Man in society -
And his simple virtues, his lofty pastoral
manners and his unsubdued freedom in the
condition of nature -
Such romantic pictures though they should
be adorned with the highest colouring of genius
can never scarcely in the slightest degree
affect [underline]the opinion[/underline] of a sound and [underline]judicious[/underline]
reasoner.-
The details of past=times the narrations
of [underline]travellers[/underline] or even simple observations
of the habits and propensities of the
human mind are sufficient to demonstrate}
