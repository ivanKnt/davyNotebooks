power is a faculty belonging to the human mind
in every state of society; and it is one by which
it is most justly characterized: one the most
worthy of being cultivated and extended.

Its general effects upon the species are in
the highest degree important and beneficial;
and the improvements in the condition and in
the happiness of mankind appear in all
instances to have preserved an uniform pace
with the progress of the inventions of
the Arts and the advancement in the
sciences. -}
