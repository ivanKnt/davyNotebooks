[underline]Of the [deletion]forms of[/deletion] [insertion]species of[/insertion] Matter[/underline]

In examining [deletion]the[/deletion] the material universe
We perceive amidst the infinite

number possessed of very similar

The simplest division of natural
bodies is into solids, fluids, gasses
or airs & [underline]etherial fluids-[/underline]
-:- [blockdeletion]Solids [insertion]& fluids[/insertion] differ in various
properties such as weight, hardness
colour lustre [unclear]Thus[/unclear]Thus gold
is nearly 20 times as heavy
as Wax-[/blockdeletion]

[deletion]A number of [unclear]different[/unclear] solids[/deletion]
[deletion]& fluids are [unclear]more[/unclear] familiarly[/deletion]
[deletion]Their[/deletion] The parts of solids adhere so strongly

[deletion]of form[/deletion] any form that may be

[deletion]of[/deletion] weight, colour, lustre hardness
are extremely various-. Thus
Gold is nearly 20 times as
heavy as wax taking equal
[unclear]bulks[/unclear]- & does not alter in
the most intense fire where as
Wax is immediately disipated
& destroyed.-
Fluids [insertion]The parts of fluids adhere more feebly so[/insertion] [deletion]on[/deletion] small [unclear]portions[/unclear] assume
the spherical form; [deletion]but[/deletion] but

[deletion]Gasses[/deletion] Gasses are all compressible

conscious that a material

[deletion]In [unclear]observing[/unclear] the changes taking[/deletion]

weight [deletion]we must conclude[/deletion]
[deletion]that[/deletion] " without any obvious
cause, we may conclude
that some [unclear][misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc][/unclear] matter

the existence & evolution of
a peculiar kind of air

- With respect to the agency
of etherial substances we
possess no such accurate

instance we must cautiously
reason upon [underline]the effects[/underline]
-& avoid all premature
conclusions respecting
the union or separation
[deletion]of etherial[/deletion] of these subtile
materials-. Thus if an
effect is perceived to be produced

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11905-000-00016|dnp19e14pp|72802472[/page]
by Light or Heat, it cannot
be concluded necessarily that
the light or heat has[deletion]ve[/deletion] com

may have separated its

new arrangements of them.-
- Thus pale [chemical]chemical_150|Aqua fortis[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric[line]Acid[/chemical] becomes yellow by exposure

[deletion]owing to any com[/deletion] must not

His powers are often wasted in
attempts to obtain triffles which vanishes

-[underline]That persons[/underline] who are only beginning

But this is a [underline]circumstance[/underline] of very little

In every well regulated mind
false confidence cannot be of any long

in science, and in such a refined period
as that in which [underline]we live[/underline] it is scarcely
possible that such a folly can flourish-
What is sometimes called pedantry
indeed may depend upon the ignorance
of the many as compared with the
knowledge of the few
But the moment the language of
science becomes the common language
of refined society every feeling of this
kind must cease -
And till that event takes place
the person must be very defficient in

Some few arguments are now

This however can scarcely happen

[underline]exertions[/underline] have been made in the
higher classes of society to diffuse
improvement and to promote all
objects of enquiry which can benefit
or enlighten the public -
There are other uses still greater
resulting from the communication
of general and poplar science
By means of it vulgar errors and
common prejudices are constantly
diminished-

they can never be actively pursued and

All [underline]minds[/underline] require [underline]hope[/underline] to [underline]animate[/underline]
them [underline]to exertion[/underline] and the desire of
glory is one the most common to
great and [underline]elevated[/underline] understandings
The increase of general knowledge
must uniformaly produce the general
patronage of letters and Philosophy -
And this is a most excellent and
important end
[underline]Men of Genius[/underline] in former times have
often languished in obscurity not because
[deletion][underline]they were not understood[/underline][/deletion] their merits
were neglected but because they

All the discoveries all the works of [underline]human[/underline]
[underline]Genius[/underline] are of great importance to the
community; but that their full [underline]effects[/underline]
may be produced; it is necessary that
the public mind [underline]be prepared to[/underline]
[underline]enjoy them[/underline] and to estimate their
advantages
The dew and the fertilizing
rain may descend from heaven but
unless the soil on which it falls
is well cultivated and the seed carefully
sown the harvest may be expected
in vain
The general diffusion of letters
and Philosophy is necessary to the
progress of the [underline]higher invention[/underline] of
[underline]the mind[/underline]

[page]56|MS-DAVY-11905-000-00056|dnp19e54pp|72802527[/page]
And there is scarcely any other weapon
than ridicule proper to be employed
the advocates of this mean doctrine
most of whom regard nothing as worthy
attention what they cannot eat or drink
most of whom would consider the invention
of a new [underline]sauce[/underline] as of more importance
than the discovery of a novel principle
in Natural Philosophy or the [deletion]constr[/deletion]
construction of an improved mouse trap
as more interesting than the production
of a sublime Poem

[underline]But independantly[/underline] of these [underline]considerations[/underline]
all truths in nature all inventions
by which they can be develloped, are
worthy of our study for their own
sake rather than with any idea of
profit or interest-
Whatever can enlarge the [underline]views[/underline] of the
mind raise new sentiments of
intellectual pleasures or make us
acquainted with new properties and
powers in the substances surrounding
us is in the highest degree worthy of
the pursuit of a being whose noblest
faculties are reason and the love
of knowledge-

[page]58|MS-DAVY-11905-000-00058|dnp19e56pp|72802530[/page]
most [underline]important inventions[/underline] which have
arisen from scientific principles have
never been ascertained till long after
the principles themselves were develloped.
And so [underline]intimately connected[/underline] are all
the objects of human enquiry; and so
much dependant upon the sensible
[underline]properties of bodies[/underline]; [deletion]that Theoretical[/deletion]
[deletion]improvement can be made without[/deletion]
that it is scarcely possible that any
great Theoretical improvement can be
made without being soon accompanied
[underline]with practical advantages[/underline]-
And new science like the new ore of a
precious metal though it cannot be
immediately brought [underline]into use[/underline] ought
not to be disregarded or thrown away-

Very few persons in the present day are
disposed to reason against the advantages
resulting from the higher refinements of
science and [underline]philosophy[/underline]-
And the only argument that can be
brought forward is one founded upon
the doctrine of common utility --
When a new fact for instance is
ascertained in chemistry or in Electricity
the superficial observer is very often
apt to slight it if it does not immediately
admit of some application to the common
wants of life -
This however is very unfair. for
all experience proves the greatest and

[page]60|MS-DAVY-11905-000-00060|dnp19e58pp|72802533[/page]
for preventing any of its parts from
falling into decay -
And knowledge is like a [underline]river[/underline] which
unless it springs are constantly supplied
soon becomes exhausted and ceases to flow
on and to fertilize
- [underline]The mind[/underline] requires [underline]novelty[/underline] even as a
stimulus to exertions:
And the [deletion]Author[/deletion] Philosopher who has made
a discovery in natural [underline]science[/underline]; or the
Author of a [underline]work of Genius[/underline], in Art or in
literature is a [underline]Benefactor[/underline] not only to the
present generation but likewise to future
ages; for He gratifies that faculty of
[underline]enjoyment[/underline] which is pure and intellectual
and which must be more exalted in
proportion as society becomes more improved

[page]61|MS-DAVY-11905-000-00061|dnp19e59pp|72802534[/page]
59
And science has given new objects and
new forms for adorning and extending
literature -
All the different branches of knowledge
have assisted each other. And like different
instruments of music, the sounds of which
combine in Harmony, They have all
cooperated in enlightening the mind in
extending its enjoyments and in exalting
the state of [underline]social Life[/underline] -
Though so [underline]magnificent[/underline] a structure
has been raised in science rapidly as if
[underline]by a kind of enchantment[/underline], yet it is still
[underline]unfinished[/underline] and new labours and new
efforts of ingenuity are required both
for ornamenting and extending it and

[deletion][unclear]whose[/unclear][/deletion]
which was obscured by the clouds of error
and of prejudice has appeared to us in all
its purity and brightness.-
And whilst nature and the order established
by the Author of Nature have been to
a great extent [underline]develloped[/underline], the science
of Man has not been neglected
The works which awaken the imagination
and exalt the feelings have preserved all
their effects upon the mind
By means of experiment a new creation
as it were of facts has appeared of facts as
much superior to mere speculations as things
can be to [underline]words[/underline]-
Letters the great instrument of thought
have assisted science. -

Hence all the productions of the
Globe are made subservient to the uses
or comforts of Man and Nature arises

or deformed but enriched and rendered more

The useful Arts in modern times
have attained an infinitely higher degree
of perfection than in the most splendid
eras of [underline]Antiquity[/underline].
And the improvements and extension
of the sciences will admit of no parallel
instances
That light of knowledge which
was only dimly perceived by the [unclear]anciens[/unclear]

likewise [deletion][unclear]but[/unclear][/deletion] to prevent their decline
All parts of the system of commerce
are intimately connected-
Honorably acquired wealth I say produces
credit; and from credit arises a capital
capable of an extent almost indefinite
Hence proceeds the division of labour.-
Hence the invention of Machinery.
Hence the circulation of wealth and power
from one extremity of the Empire to the
other, communicating like the vital blood

health and strength -

No person who understands the luxury of the
table will assert that a sheep rendered
uncommonly fat on rich pasture or on turnips
is better or [underline]more luxurious food[/underline] than one
that grazed on the aromatic herbage of the
mountains;
but in the attempt to produce this well
fed animal which perhaps gains the prize
at [place]place_805|smithfield[/place] a number of others have
been improved to a less extent and rendered
in consequence more adapted to common
use and the high price of well fed cattle
has awakened the [underline]feeling of emulation[/underline]
amongst [deletion]the[/deletion] Farmers. -

The elegant models of the Etruscan
vases produced by the ingenuity of the
late excellent [person]person_135|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Wedgwood[/person] may be said
to have no immediate application to
common uses; but yet in consequence of
their invention a spirit of immitation
and of emulation has operated upon
every branch of the porcelain manufacture
and even the form and composition
of our common pitchers and [underline]our common[/underline]
[underline]flower pots[/underline] in consequence have [underline]been[/underline]
[underline]improved[/underline] -.
In certain departments of industry
still greater advantages result from
the constant attempts to attain the
highest degree of excellence.-

than they would otherwise be which
are disposed of at a moderate rate.
A finely polished knife for instance
which costs [underline]a Guinea[/underline] may not have a
better edge than one which sells for
a shilling only, but the cutler who
has produced the expensive knife from his
accurate acquaintance with his Art gained
from habit and laborious operation is
able to make [underline]the common knife better[/underline]
and at a lower rate. -
A thousand cases of the same kind might

To the superficial observer the attempt
to extend the refinement of inventions
beyond that state in which they are
fitted for all the usual purposes of life
may appear unnecessary -
but it [underline]should be remembered[/underline] that in
coming at perfection in a manufacture
the workman is constantly improving
himself and in attempting to produce
articles which are to sell at a high
price He makes a number much better

cannot indeed be denied; but a few facts
derived even from the History of empires of
Antiquity will distinctively shew: that the

[underline]those[/underline] periods, the most distinguished by

Such persons have generally founded their

instances to have preserved an uniform pace
with the progress of the inventions of
the Arts and the advancement in the
sciences. -
