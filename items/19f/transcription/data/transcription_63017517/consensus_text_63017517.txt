[underline]Vegetables[/underline] are possessed of a principle
of life and they are acted upon [underline]laws[/underline]
different from those which govern common
matter. Their functions however are
modified by external agents; and their
living powers being exerted in a much
more feeble manner than those of Animals
are more immediately influenced by
common natural changes
All Vegetables are produced from seed
Their germination and growth depend
upon the assimilation of new matter
to their living parts
They derive their nourishment
from the soil in which they grow
and the Atmosphere by which they are
surrounded
