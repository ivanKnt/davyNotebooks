The alburnum in shrubs and in
annual plants bears only a very
small proportion to the bark and
pith and there is little accumulation
of woody matter except in the fibres
of [underline]the roots[/underline].
The leaves of plants are attached
to their branches by foot stalks their
basis is a number of fibres which
intersect each other in various
directions and which contain the
tubes through which the sap
rises to their extremities
They are covered by an epidermis
and beneath this is situated the
membranes or parynchenitous part
