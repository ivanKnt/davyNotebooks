The greater number of [underline]flowers[/underline] are fixed in a
cup or [underline]Calyx[/underline] which is attached to the flower
stalk and which has been supposed though
erroneously to be a continuation of the outer bark
The [underline]Corolla[/underline] or [underline]petals[/underline] form in most cases
the base of the flower and in the conolla are
inserted the parts of reproduction the organs
essential to the formation of seeds
most plants contain the stamina and the
pistil in one coralla but in others they
are arranged in separate cups. and in a few
cases they exist in distinct plants
The [underline]pistil[/underline] is the basis of the [underline]seed[/underline] in
all plants but that it may be converted into the
seed it is necessary that it be acted upon by
the pollen or dust upon the Anther of the
stamina
