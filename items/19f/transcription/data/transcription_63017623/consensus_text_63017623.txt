M[superscript]r[/superscript] Vaquelin found in the sap of the
beach and of the Elm a small quantity
of [underline]mucilage[/underline] and astringent matter
and some saline substances containing
the Acetous Acid or Vinegar -
The Birch as is well known affords
a sap containing sugar and capable
of fermenting and the juice exuded from
the Ivy is almost a pure solution of
mucilage in water.
The fluid obtained from the
young shoots of Wheat and of Barley
is allways more or less with sugar.
