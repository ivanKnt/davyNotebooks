This conclusion at first view appears
extraordinary but it is countenanced by
the great [deletion]science[/deletion] [insertion]series[/insertion] of chemical facts
Even in our common processes we
are capable of producing a very great
diversity of compounds by the different
union of two or three bodies -
Sulphuric acid salts
In these cases solids become fluids
and fluids are partly converted into
[deletion]gases[/deletion] gases and a variety of Changes
are almost [underline]instantaneously[/underline] produced -
-[underline]The powers[/underline] by which these
extraordinary effects are produced in our
hands are extremely limited and the
combining attractions so quickly
