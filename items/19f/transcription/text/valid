The practice of Agriculture is founded
wholly upon experience but many great
improvements have been made in consequence
of the application of the general principles
of science to the Theory of the art
of the different branches of physical
knowledge no one perhaps is more immediately
connected with the doctrine of the Cultivation
of the Earth than Chemistry
This science relates to all those
changes on which the growth and
nourishment of plants depend
It affords the only means that are in
our possession of explaining the operations
of manures and the causes of the

fertility [deletion]of[/deletion] or [underline]barreness[/underline] of soils can be
investigated only in chemical principles -
Philosophical chemistry is a science of
late origin and that part of it which
relates to Agriculture is still in an
infant state but it has nevertheless already
afforded many interesting facts and it
is connected with investigation of very
great importance.
In attempting to give an account
of the connection of Chemistry with
agriculture - I shall endeavour to follow
that order of arrangement which begins
with the least obscure part of the [deletion]sup[/deletion]
subject

I shall in all cases where it is possible
employ experimental elucidations and without
entering upon the History of the progress
of the enquiry. I shall detail all such
well authenticated facts as I have been
able to collect which promise to lead to
either to useful practice or to improvements
in Theory
The same general arrangement as
that followed in the last course will be
adopted in this and the introductry part
of the subject I shall be able to add
but little novel matter -
With regard however [deletion]with regard[/deletion]
to the most important objects the
analysis of soils and the operation

of manures I shall bring forward some
new experiments and and facts which
are founded upon information that I
collected in different parts of England
in the course of last summer and which
I flatter myself will not be found wholly
unworthy of the board.
The great object of the chemistry
of agriculture is the discovery of the best
possible manner of cultivating different
lands so as to produce upon them the
greatest quantity of useful plants -
This object which at first view
might appear simple is in fact very
complicated and is connected with a
great variety of scientific generalizations

[underline]Vegetables[/underline] are possessed of a principle
of life and they are acted upon [underline]laws[/underline]
different from those which govern common
matter. Their functions however are
modified by external agents; and their
living powers being exerted in a much
more feeble manner than those of Animals
are more immediately influenced by
common natural changes
All Vegetables are produced from seed
Their germination and growth depend
upon the assimilation of new matter
to their living parts
They derive their nourishment
from the soil in which they grow
and the Atmosphere by which they are
surrounded

[page]13|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00013|dnp19f11pp|63017522[/page]
11
And that we may be able to judge of
the manner in which this nourishment
is subservient to their life it is necessary
that we should first study the nature
of the organs by which it is received
and modified and the [underline]principles[/underline] of
which they are composed.
The forms of vegetables are almost [deletion]inf[/deletion]
infinitely diversified - yet the [underline]structure[/underline] of
such of them as have been accurately examined
is found in many respects anagolous and
in consequence of this circumstance the
same general reasonings may be applied
in accounting for the functions of the
same species of organs in different
plants

In every [underline]perfect vegetable[/underline] there are found
at least four distinct classes of organs
which though very different as to their
size and appearances are in some respects
similar in construction.
The roots the trunk and branches
The leaves and the flowers or seeds -
The roots the trunk and branches are
chiefly alike as to original structure and
they are composed of analogous parts
When the trunk of a tree is cut
transversely there is perceived at least
three different bodies the bark the wood
and the pith and these bodies [deletion]are[/deletion] are
again capable of a new division

[page]16|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00016|dnp19f14pp|63017529[/page]
[page]17|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00017|dnp19f15pp|63017532[/page]
15
The [underline]bark[/underline] when perfectly formed is
covered by a [deletion]new[/deletion] thin [underline]membrane[/underline] which
as in the instance of [underline]the Elder[/underline] may be
easily seperated and which is called the
[deletion]epiad[/deletion] [underline]epidermis[/underline] it is composed of a
number of small lamine or scales
and in old trees is found broken
into parts at its surface. - Instance
Beneath the [deletion]surface is[/deletion] epidermis
is situated the [underline]parynchyma[/underline] which is
a soft substance of a cellular structure
its colour is green and it is allways
more or less filled with moisture.
The cortical layers form the [deletion]innermost[/deletion]
inner most part of the [underline]bark[/underline] and their
numbers vary with the age and size of the
Tree

They are composed of [underline]longitudinal fibres[/underline]
which in some cases are exceedingly strong
and firm and they contain pores or
vessels which may be distinctly seen in
many instances in the horizontal section
The [underline]external[/underline] part of the wood in
trees is called the sap wood or [underline]alburnum[/underline]
it is the living part and in annual
shoots reaches even to the pith it
contains a number of pores or vessels
in some of which the sap appears
immediately to ascend from the roots
and in others of which it is transmited
to the leaves.
The woody matter in the alburnum
consists of the silver grain and of the
bastard grain - -

[underline]Instance[/underline] Oak
The first appears in their lamina
extending from the pith towards the
bark -
The second constitutes the concentric
[underline]layers[/underline] which denote by their number
the age of the tree -
Instance
The pith or medulla in young trees
and in annual shoots is soft and full
of juice but in old trees it is dry and
spongy - It is composed of a number
of cells and in its living state its
use is probably to supply moisture
to the vessels of the [underline]Alburnum[/underline] by
the spinal tubes -

[person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] has shewn however that the
presence of it is not essential to the
growth of plants, for it was found in
cases when it was removed that
vegetation was not materialy impeded
In the [underline]roots[/underline] of [underline]trees[/underline] as may be
easily discovered by inspection there
is the same arrangement of parts
as in the trunk and branches -
The pores or vessels in the alburnum
extend to the minutest filaments and
in these filaments they appear to exert
their action in the moisture and
nourishing fluids contained in the
soil

[page]24|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00024|dnp19f22pp|63017547[/page]

[page]25|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00025|dnp19f23pp|63017549[/page]
23
The alburnum in shrubs and in
annual plants bears only a very
small proportion to the bark and
pith and there is little accumulation
of woody matter except in the fibres
of [underline]the roots[/underline].
The leaves of plants are attached
to their branches by foot stalks their
basis is a number of fibres which
intersect each other in various
directions and which contain the
tubes through which the sap
rises to their extremities
They are covered by an epidermis
and beneath this is situated the
membranes or parynchenitous part

in the pores or cells of which the
nourishment that they recieve from the
sap is probably modified and rendered
fit for assimilation -
The flowers of plants are the
vegetable organs that have been
most [deletion]studied[/deletion] accurately studied
and most minutely described and
it is upon the different constitution
and arrangements of their parts
that [underline]Linneaus[/underline] has founded that
admirable system of classification
which has given to botany the form
of a perfect science.

27
The greater number of [underline]flowers[/underline] are fixed in a
cup or [underline]Calyx[/underline] which is attached to the flower
stalk and which has been supposed though
erroneously to be a continuation of the outer bark
The [underline]Corolla[/underline] or [underline]petals[/underline] form in most cases
the base of the flower and in the corolla are
inserted the parts of reproduction the organs
essential to the formation of seeds
most plants contain the stamina and the
pistil in one coralla but in others they
are arranged in seperate cups. and in a few
cases they exist in distinct plants
The [underline]pistil[/underline] is the basis of the [underline]seed[/underline] in
all plants but that it may be converted into the
seed it is necessary that it be acted upon by
the pollen or dust upon the Anther of the
stamina

[page]30|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00030|dnp19f28pp|63017560[/page]
28

[page]31|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00031|dnp19f29pp|63017562[/page]
29
In consequence of this obscure and [deletion]in[/deletion] singular
agency its form gradually changes and it is
at last converted into the seed vessel -
In cases when the pistil and stamina are
seated in one corolla the pollen [deletion]is[/deletion] is
immediately deposited upon the [underline]pistil[/underline] by
contact, but in the instances in which
they are seperated from each other no
impregnation takes place unless the fecundatin[superscript][unclear]g[/unclear][/superscript]
dust has been carried upon the seminal
parts by winds or by other causes and it
often happens as for instance in the case
of the [underline]female date[/underline] trees that [underline]blossoms[/underline] are
[underline]produced[/underline] but no fruits till male trees
are brought in their vicinity

[page]32|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00032|dnp19f30pp|63017564[/page]
[page]33|MS-DAVY-11906-000-00033|dnp19f31pp|63017566[/page]
31
The seeds of plants are infolded in differen[superscript]t[/superscript]
membranes and when the and when the
corolla and stamina have disappeared after
performing their necessary functions they
are discovered in the place of the [underline]base[/underline] of
the [underline]pistil[/underline]- -
When their outward coatings are removed
they are usually found containing two principle
parts the radicle and the plumula which
are the foundation for the root and stem
of the infant plant these parts are small
and visible only in a small number of
seeds; they are discovered by minute
inspection in the large Garden bean even
in its dry state and in their [underline]devellopmen[superscript]t[/superscript][/underline]
in [deletion]corn[/deletion] corn that has undergone malting

33
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The largest part of the seed is constituted by
the [underline]Colyledons[/underline] which are the situated on
each side of the radicle and which are destined
for the nourishment of the infant plant
The Colyledons are two in number in the
bean - Instance and wheat only one
It will at present be unnecessary to
enter more minutely into the study of the
structure of vegetables and their various
forms and diversified organs.
This branch of the science even where
it has been most successfully pursued is still
far removed from perfection and the [deletion]sipt[/deletion]
simplest part of it is that which is most
immediately connected with the facts at
present Known relating to the living functions
of plants

The [underline]most general[/underline] the [underline]least perfect[/underline] of the
parts of vegetables these which approach
nearest [deletion]In[/deletion] in their nature to inorganic
matter are yet eminently different from
any of the [underline]substances[/underline] which are subservient
to their formation -
[underline]These substances[/underline] consequently must
have undergone a new arrangement in
the vegetable organs an arrangement
which can only be estimated by the chemical
laws -

us the means of estimating the alternate
known principles of which vegetable
substances are composed and enable us
to form a probable judgment [insertion]of the manner[/insertion] in which
these principles are procured -
When any of the vegetable organs are
long acted upon by boiling water some
of their parts are dissolved; and after
water is no longer capable of changing
them new principles are taken up by spirit
of wine or Alcohol and made to enter
into Chemical union with it - |_ After these
fluids have exerted all their powers

number of cases in found possessed of very
similar chemical properties and it is called
woody fibre and it forms the basis of
most of the solid parts of Trees and plants

The substances soluble in water are
usually Gum of which mucilage and
and farina are modifications Sugar

The principles acted [deletion]up[/deletion]on by Spirits
of wine are resinous and oily matters
which are much more seldom found than
the bodies soluble in water

The analysis afforded by the solution
in fluids offers us however only the
secondary elements of vegetable matter
and the arrangements of these elements
may in many cases be traced with
considerable accuracy in the [underline]vegetable[/underline]
organs. -
Thus we find woody fibre forming
almost wholly the interior wood or
fibres of the plant, where its [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion][insertion]ri[/insertion]gidity
and hardness render it necessary to the
support of the organs -
In the [underline]alburnum[/underline] [deletion]and[/deletion] of farinaceous
plants and different edible plants
mucilage and sugar are often [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] found

and these substances exist abundantly
in fruits.
And in the Apple the pear and the
plumb and other similar productions
They are united to vegetable acids
The [underline]Colyledons[/underline] of seeds are for the
most part composed of farina or coagula[insertion]ted[/insertion]
mucilage -
In the bean for instance this substance
exists in abundance and it is dissolved
after long ebullition - In barley it is
found almost pure - |_ in wheat it is
united to a peculiar insoluable substance
called gluten and in [unclear]nuts[/unclear] and other
similar seeds it is combined with oil

The leaves of the greater number of
large trees contain as well as mucilage
different astringent principles; [deletion]and[/deletion]
[deletion]these principles are usually most[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]abundant[/underline] in the internal cortical[/deletion]
[deletion]layers which are the parts most efficient[/deletion]
[deletion]in Tanning skin.-[/deletion]

  parts which usually contain the colouring

[blockdeletion]The [underline]epidermis[/underline] both in the bark and

resisting the action of water -
in many cases the upper surface of leaves
is covered with a substance analogous
to [underline]wax[/underline] -
Instance
The varnish prevents the evaporation
of moisture by the action of the Solar
light and the under surface being
free from it is capable of absorbing
water from the air and of drinking
in the dew -

surfaces of their Stalks is owing to this
substance -
[blockdeletion]If a stalk of Corn be carefully burnt
in a crucible the Earthy matter will
be seen retaining the form of the
epidermis and reticular in its appearance
And in all these vegetables which are
hollow internally the silicious earth
not only acts by defending their tender
barks from external injury but serves
to support and to strengthen and may
be considered as in some measure analogous
in its purposes to the earthy matter in
the shells of different animals -[/blockdeletion]

of plants into the substances that have
been just described -
The analysis by means of fluids offers
to us no ultimate [deletion]products[/deletion] [insertion]results[/insertion] and it is
only by employing the agency of [underline]heat[/underline]
that we are capable of gaining any
knowledge of the real undecomposable
[underline]principles[/underline] of [underline]vegetable matter[/underline]
Instance
[underline]When[/underline] any part of a plant is exposed in
close vessels in which the products of the
experiment[deletion]s[/deletion] can be examined to the action of fire
water is the first substance that rises from it
permanently elastic fluids are then generated
a little oil and Acid come over and the
substance remaining is Charcoal mixed with
a small quantity of Alk[insertion]a[/insertion]li & earthy matter

[underline]Instance[/underline] Gum
By passing this fluid matter through a
tube heated red it would be considerably
altred and would be converted into elastic or
aeriform fluid water and Charcoal so that
the vegetable matter would be wholly resolved
by the powers of Heat into gas or air water
charcoal and saline matter.
[deletion]Mucilage[/deletion]
Mucilage sugar and woody fibre colouring
matters and the astringent principles and
all the secondary component parts of the
organs of plants would undergo like
changes but they would produce different
proportions of new substances
[underline]The Charcoal[/underline] is largest in quantity
from the woody fibre water is procured
in greatest proportion from sugar & mucilage

This to be introduced instead of this

- The charcoal, Earths & alkalies produced
  by the decomposition of Vegetable
  Matter are less compounded than
  any of the other materials
  given out; - The charcoal
  seems to consist principally
  of a substance called
  [underline]carbon[/underline] united to inflammable
  air. - [underline]The Alkalies[/underline] as
  will be distinctly shewn in a
  [deletion]another[/deletion] future lecture are composed of
  peculiar metals united to pure
  air & the Earths seem
  analogous in composition.
  Water is likewise a compound this principle

the resins oils and astringent principles evolve
most aeriform fluids, and oxide or rust of Iron
is found in [deletion]most cases[/deletion] [insertion]general[/insertion] in the [deletion]rest of[/deletion] residuum
of the vegetable matter -
[blockdeletion][underline]The Charcoal[/underline] [deletion]Earths[/deletion] and Alkalies produced
by the decomposition of vegetable matter are
incapable of being reduced into a simpler form
by any Known means and in their pure
states they are supposed to be perfectly
elementary principles.[/blockdeletion]
[deletion]The water and [underline]aeriform[/underline] bodies [insertion]still[/insertion] are less[/deletion]
[deletion]permanent in their nature and by the[/deletion]
[deletion]later discoveries they are shewn to be compound[/deletion]
[insertion]supposed by the ancients to be the most perfect of[/insertion]
[insertion]the elements has been proved by the researches of the[/insertion]
[insertion]Moderns to consist of two species of Air.[/insertion]
When [insertion]an[/insertion] [underline]electrical[/underline] [deletion]sparks are[/deletion] [insertion] current is[/insertion] passed [deletion]into[/deletion]
[insertion]through[/insertion] water gas is slowly evolved from it and a
part of this gas when it is examined is found
analogous to that aeriform fluid in our
atmosphere which supports combustion and which
is called oxygene.

whilst the other part is inflamable and is
denominated Hydrogene the producer of water
[blockdeletion]so that the body supposed by the ancients to be
the most perfectly elementry consists of pure
inflammable airs united by its attraction
in a condensed form and in proportions to
each other as about [deletion]1 one to[/deletion][/blockdeletion] 1 to 6
When the gas evolved by the action of
Heat upon vegetable matter is agitated
with [underline]lime water[/underline]; an absorption takes place
and a part of the Lime is precipitated
in union with [underline]elastic fluid[/underline]-
This absorbable part is fixed air and
is the same substance with that which is
disengaged from Limestone by vinegar and
which is found in brewers vats

It is likewise formed by the burning of
[underline]charcoal[/underline] and it is considered as a compound
of pure Charcoal or [underline]carbon[/underline] and oxygene
or the vital air found in the Atmosphere
and its properties being slightly sour it is
called carbonic Acid -

- The gas not absorbable by [underline]lime[/underline]
  [unclear]x[/unclear] [underline]water[/underline] is found for the most part to be
  combustible and it usually burns with a
  lambent flame.
  When chemically examined it is disc-
  -overed to be precisely similar in its properties -
  to the substance obtained by passing pure
  inflamable air or Hydrogene over Charcoal
  Heated red.
  It is believed to be a combination of
  Hydrogene and Carbon and it is usually called
  [underline]Hydrocarbonate[/underline] -

[underline]The elements[/underline] of plants then gained by
destructive distillation as is evident from
these observations are extremely few and their
nature [underline]is easily understood[/underline] -
[underline]Results[/underline] proving the same general facts
are gained from the combustion of vegetable
matters in the open atmosphere and by
[deletion]defalgration[/deletion] deflagration of them with nitre
or with the salt called oxymuriate of Potash
which contains an immense quantity of
oxygene or pure [underline]air[/underline]-

In this case water Carbonic Acid and
a little incombustible gas only are [deletion]produced[/deletion]
evolved and a dense charcoal remains -
in the vessel -

The experiment might be diversified in
a variety of manners but the products would
be analogous in their nature though different
in quantity in different instances. -
By no methods of investigation can absolute
certainty be [deletion]obtained[/deletion] obtained in physical
[underline]science[/underline] but all the phenomena seem
to concur in shewing that the various
parts and organs of plants are constituted
by different arrangements and chemical
combinations of a few simple principles
which are for the most part oxygene
or the base of pure air Hydrogene
[deletion]of[/deletion] or inflamable air and carbon or
pure charcoal and [deletion]different[/deletion] [insertion]the metallic bases of the[/insertion] Earthy
and Alkaline [underline]substances[/underline] -

This conclusion at first view appears
extraordinary but it is countenanced by
the great [deletion]science[/deletion] [insertion]series[/insertion] of chemical facts
Even in our common processes we
are capable of producing a very great
diversity of compounds by the different
union of two or three bodies -
Sulphuric acid salts
In these cases solids become fluids
and fluids are partly converted into
[deletion]gasses[/deletion] gasses and a variety of Changes
are almost [underline]instantaneously[/underline] produced - -
[underline]The powers[/underline] by which these
extraordinary effects are produced in our
hands are extremely limited and the
combining attractions so quickly

But in natural operations the agents
are presented to each other under a variety
of circumstances that can never be obtained
in our artificial experiments -
chemical affinities are modified by
the powers of life and the alterations
of form and structure take place slowly
and after a beautiful and varied order
The [underline]Knowledge[/underline] of the ultimate
composition of vegetable substances will
enable us to understand [insertion]the nature of the food of plants & their growth[/insertion] & the agencies of
the Atmosphere and of soils upon [deletion]plants[/deletion] [insertion]them[/insertion]
