Bodies possess the power of communicating
repulsive motion from their attraction [deletion]the[/deletion]
[deletion]attraction[/deletion] if two bodies A & B attract
each other & the particles of A have a
repulsive motion equal to x as well
as the particles of B. then they will
be in equilibrium tho A is a fluid
& B a gas or projectile repulsive
fluid - [deletion]Let A be [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] opaque -[/deletion]
But if B. have added to it by any
means repulsive the particles will move in
greater space then absolute gravitating
matter will be still the same
How can B communicate motion
to a
