The idea of the spunge accurate & unphilosophical
An atmosphere with [deletion]an[/deletion] simply an increased proportion
of P. oxygen has never been tried to its full
extent from the administration of ten twenty
or thirty cubic feet of this in a day
after which the patient [deletion]went to[/deletion] breathed
[insertion]oxygen[/insertion][deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] usual atmosphere little could be expected
in truly formidable complaints. The exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
already made seem to prove that no
difficulty would be found to increase
the arterial action by a permanent
atmosphere of oxygen. - Oxygen we
are conscious as well as nutriment is
something more than a stimulus. Sensibility
& irritability appear more immediately
to depend on respiration & [deletion]that[/deletion] that we
may [deletion]hope[/deletion] [insertion]find[/insertion] something more [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] it than
 [deletion]in[/deletion] a simple stimulus for the arterial
system. it may restore irritability & give
to the nerves then deficient energy.
P.oxygen demands a fair trial in
all diseases with debility, in paralysis

Typhus confluent small pox &c.
