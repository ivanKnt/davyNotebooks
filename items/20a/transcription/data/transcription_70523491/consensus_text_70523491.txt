[In pencil written vertically in margins: Journal August 26- 1799 -]
The changes taking place in
organic beings infinitely more complex
than those of inanimate substances
involve a number of principles
many: of which are unknown
in their [unclear]simple[/unclear] state[unclear]/[/unclear] & the attraction
susceptibilit[deletion]y[/deletion]ies of [unclear]repetition[/unclear] of the
others are totally hidden from us.
That changes in the organic
matter of the body must accompany
every change of our perceptions
is a fact which no one will
deny. The state of a nerve
during its [unclear]sensitiment[/unclear] is essentially
different from that of its torpid state
external - bodies can communicate
nothing but motion & either there
must be as many different
motions in the different [unclear]nerves[/unclear]
