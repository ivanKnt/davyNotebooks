Our hopes must rest on the
united efforts of the sons of
genius, the friends of science
& humanity. -
One thing however is certain
the energies of a certain portion
of the human species are awakened
& there exist those who think
that Man was neither
born to suffer eternally moral
& physical evil. - Their exist
those whom rational scepticism
leads alone to exertion -
who are confident of nothing
but who hope for much.
They are lighted by the lamp
of true philosophy. - who neither
consider the immortality new
