De la Metherie in his work on airs
attempts to prove that the dephlogisticated
Nitrous gas of Priestley is a mixture
of pure & Nitrous air He [unclear]assumes[/unclear]
its diminution both with common
& Nitrous air & likewise asserts.
that He procures it from
platina.
Kirwan in his work on the
[unclear]hepatic[/unclear] gas discovered this air
& seems to have been the first
who entertained any notion of
its composition; He supposed
it to be Nitrous gas deacidified. -
Milner asserts that He
perceived proofs of its existence
in the decomposition of Ammonia
by Manganese.
