The changes
The perfection of chemical science
Nothing perhaps is more absurd in the present
state of our knowledge than to connect
scientific generalisations of the phaenomena
of life, with the common & simple
changes [deletion]taking place in our organs[/deletion]. -
perpetually taking place on our globe. -
The rapid changes in our organs connected
with perceptions & muscular motions are
altogether out of the power of our
senses & it is only by ascertaining
the changes effected in dead matter
by living beings & comparing those
changes with known analogous ones
in [deletion]dead matter[/deletion] than we can ever
to make any progress in the Knowledge
of the chemistry of life -
Till we are acquainted with the simple
laws of attraction by which two
more principles are connected or separated
