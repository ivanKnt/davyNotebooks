have arisen from false generalisations -
Man not contented with the ultimate
effect cognisable by his sense is ever fond
of going beyond the sphere of faculties
in the invention of causes. The calorique
of Lavoisier & the ether of Newton
do not afford the only instances
of the readiness with which philosophy
supplies words without meaning to
express the causes of certain effects
our future acquaintance with
the phaenomena of nature will
I doubt not rather extend
than diminish our generalisations
We shall at last find all
matter governed by the same
laws differently modified, [unclear][deletion]xx[/deletion][/unclear]
superiority of modern
theories have depended
on the accuracy
