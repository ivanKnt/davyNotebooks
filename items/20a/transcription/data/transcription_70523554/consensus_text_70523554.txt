The 87, 5 cubic inches of gas [unclear]Nitri[/unclear]
consequently weighed 31,2
But [deletion]31[/deletion] 87, 5: 31,2,100
[Mathematical equation]
35, 6 according
to this calculation
the weight of 100
cubic inches
[Horizontal rule]
15 [deletion]measures[/deletion] [insertion]cubic inches[/insertion] of pure Nitrous
gas weighing of course 5,34 grains
[insertion]This coud not contain more than [deletion]25[/deletion] Azote[/insertion]
Were absorbed by 8,[insertion]9[/insertion]5 of oxygen
the residuum was 2 & supposing
a cubic inch of oxygen to weigh
6,75 will weigh
2,3 grains
