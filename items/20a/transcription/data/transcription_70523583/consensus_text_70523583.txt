Ammonia, Now it is evident
that if Nitrous gas & water
decompose each other, there
must be a certain ratio
between the ammonia & the
nitrous acid formed
Let us discover this ratio. -
suppose
1 of Hydrogene requires 6 of Nitrogen
- . . & 6 of oxygene
2 of Nitrous gas requires 1 of oxygene
to form nitrous acid. -
Let d be the Nitrous gas
& b the water
Then the hydrogene of B requires
6 of the nitrogene of the Nitrous gas
to form water
