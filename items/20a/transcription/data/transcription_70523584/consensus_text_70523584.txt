oxygene of the water to form
nitrous acid: but as much
Nitrogene as d gives so much
oxygene must b give. -
But d+1 = Nitrous acid -
[Horizontal rule]
Water consists of 15 Hydrogene & 85 oxygene
Nitrous acid consists of 3 oxygene [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear]
Nitrous gas consists of 2 Oxy & 1 Nitrogen
100 parts of Nitrous gas require 33 parts oxygen
to form Nitrous acid.-
13 parts of Hydrogene require 87 of Nitrogene
to form Ammonia
