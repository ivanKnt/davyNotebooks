Given the oxygene & Nitrogene &
in Nitrous acid the oxygene &
Nitrogene in Nitrous gas, the
oxygene Hydrogene in water &
the Hydrogene & nitrogene
in Ammonia - To find
how much water must be
decomposed to convert 100 parts
of Nitrous gas into Nitrous acid
by combining with its Nitrogene to
form Ammonia & giving it its
oxygene
The Nitrous acid formed must
consist of 3 oxygene 1 Nitrogene
the Ammonia formed must consist
[underline]of [/underline]1 [underline]Hydrogene & 6[/underline] Nitrogene
All the oxygene of the Nitrous gas is
employed. - which is 66 - but its 34
