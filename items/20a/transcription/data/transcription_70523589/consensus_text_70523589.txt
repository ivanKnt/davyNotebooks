of Nitrogene must be divided into two
parts one of which must combine with
a certain portion of the hydrogene of
water but the water must be in
both but the water must be in
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] quantity[/deletion] but the hydrogene
of the water is to the oxygene
as [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] 1 to 6 nearly.
but as Nitrous acid consists of
[unclear]x[/unclear] Nitrogene; If 22 of Nitrogene
remained it would form Nitrous
acid with the 66; but
[deletion]22[/deletion]
take 22 from 34 & the
remainder is 12
12 Nitrogene remains then; but
this must decompose water by the
attraction of one part of it for
the oxygene of the water &
by the attraction of the other
part of it for the hydrogene
