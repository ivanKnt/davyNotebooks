But the water must be
divided into two parts to each
other as 15 to 85.
& 15 of hydrogene require
8.5 of Nitrogene to form ammonia. -
but if the Nitrogene be divided
in this way it evident that
the oxygene must be 8.5 & consequently
will be superabundant. -
I discovered this Night that
Nitrous acid has a stronger affinity
for the oxyd of iron than Sulphuric
acid & that when it combines
with the [deletion]sulphuric acid[/deletion]. Nitrous
acid it must be oxydated to a
greater extent & in this oxydation
produces from a concentrated acid
Nitrous gas or gaseous oxyd.-
