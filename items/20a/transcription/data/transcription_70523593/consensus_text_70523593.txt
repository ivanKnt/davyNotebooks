it is the attraction of this
for the oxygene of the water
that enables Sulphate of iron
to absorb Nitrous gas, the
Nascent hydrogene attracts the
[deletion]oxygene[/deletion] [insertion]Nitrogene[/insertion] of the Nitrous gas
which is consequently converted
into Nitrous acid. -
100 Nitrous gas suppose this
formed into Nitrous acid & Nitrogene [deletion]by[/deletion]
then the Nitrogene must be divided
into two parts one of which must combine
with 85 of oxygene to form Nitrous acid
& the other with 15 of Hydrogene to
form Ammonia; but 85 of oxygene
reuire d Nitrogene & 15 Hydrogene b
therefore x : d : [deletion]d[/deletion] y : b
x+y = Nitrogene
