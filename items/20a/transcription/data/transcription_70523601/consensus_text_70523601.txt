Observations on the changes

Heat. -
At temperatures [deletion]about[/deletion] 300[superscript][unclear]o[/unclear][/superscript] [insertion]280. solid[/insertion] the Nitrate of
Ammonia is fluid between 300 & 310
it slowly sublimes & between 310 & [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
to perhaps 600[deletion][unclear]or[/unclear][/deletion] 700 its is decomposed
into Water & Nitrous oxyd. whilst a [insertion]little free acid is disengaged[/insertion]
with little or no increase of temperature
during this decomposition . between the

into water, & Nitrous oxyd. [deletion]whilst[/deletion] with

Perhaps no part of chemistry is more obscure
than that relating to the different
