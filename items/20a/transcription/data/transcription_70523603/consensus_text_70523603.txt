and Ammonia two gases by entering
into combination produce a solid compound
whilst they produce a considerable increase
of temperature, fluid at 308 they
assume a new form of existence &
two new bodies exist having but
a feeble affinity for each other
& one of them incapable of alteration
by any substance in nature beside
except at a very high temperature.
It appears then that those reciprocal
attractions ie that of Nitrogene for
[deletion]Ammonia[/deletion] [insertion]Hydrogene[/insertion], that of oxygene for Hydrogene
& of oxygene for Nitrogene are dissolved.
instead of them the oxygene.
The attraction of Hydrogene for Nitrogene
is we know weakened by heat for oxygene
increased; but temperatures below 400
do not decompose any of the combinations
of oxygene & Nitrogene hence it appears
