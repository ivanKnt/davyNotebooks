From the formation of Nitre it appears that
oxygene & Nitrogene somehow combine at the
common temperature. - when 1 part of a
fluid is rapidly expanded. [unclear][deletion]&[/unclear][/deletion]by the transmission
of the electric spark through it it must
[deletion]immediate[/deletion] produce approximation of
other parts of it
that a considerable affinity exists
between those two bodies at that
temperature - Hence the Nitrogene combines
with the remaining oxygene to form NItrous oxyd -
The exact points of saturation prove that
the affinity exercised by bodies must be
compound & that certain sums of Attraction
correspondend.. in at[superscript]c[/superscript] air 27 parts of oxygene
are combined with 73 Nitrogene here it would
appear that the affinity of many particles
of nitrogen are divided upon one of oxygene
In nitrous oxyd which is more condensed
the affinity is stronger & the body more
