condensed. here the affinity of oxygene
prevails rather more in Nitrous gas
the affinity is sufficient to prevent
it from being decomposed by heat.
& by most combustible bodies, tho
bodies which attract oxygene slowly
at the common temperature are
capable of decomposing it. -
Nitrous acid seems to be the result
of the union of Nitrous gas with
Oxygene, this union takes place at
the common temperature it is dissolved
likewise at the common temperature
& in some cases where the bodies
attract oxygene strongly the Nitrous
gas is decomposed
