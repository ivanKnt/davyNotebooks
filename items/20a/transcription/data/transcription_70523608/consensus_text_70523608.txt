supposing at [superscript][unclear]c[/unclear][/superscript]air then a chemical compound
it consists of oxygene held down by many
particles of Nitrogene whose attraction
for it is less intimate from its
division - consequently in this compound
the oxygene is easily seperated from
the Nitrogene -
In Nitrous oxyd on the contrary
perhaps nearly equal quantities of
oxygene & Nitrogene are attracted by
equal forces. Hence this body is
extremely difficult of decomposition &
has but little affinities for other
bodies [deletion]its[/unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] & is [insertion]consequently more[/insertion] more condensed
than Nitrous gas or A[superscript]tc[/superscript] air - it
never gives out Nitrogene to form
Ammonia & is only decomposable by
strong oxygene attractions at high temp[superscript][unclear]x[/unclear][/superscript] -
Nitrous gas we may consider as oxygene
attract[deletion]ing[/deletion][insertion]ed[/insertion] small quantities of Nitrogene
