[deletion][unclear]but[/unclear][/deletion]. The oxygene is not easily taken
from the Nitrogene; but the
Nitrogene by being attracted by
many particles has little affinity for
once hence it is seperated by hydrogen
to form ammonia.-
The Nitrous gas is not decomposable
by [insertion]Red[/insertion] heat as is the gas [unclear][insertion]x[/insertion][/unclear] oxyd into
Nitrous acid & common air -
but at high heat into Nitrous
acid & Nitrogene: hence it appears
that the mass of the attractions
of Nitrogene are less in Nitrous
gas.

Quere in that expt in which gaseous oxide
is converted into [deletion]Nitrous[/deletion] common air is not
water decomposed the oxygene of which combines
with the Nitrous gas of the gaseous oxyd - & in Nitrous
gas when decomposed by [unclear]electrity[/unclear]
