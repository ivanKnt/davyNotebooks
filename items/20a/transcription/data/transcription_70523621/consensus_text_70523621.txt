It is evident that if water be decomposed
its Hydrogene will demand 6 of [deletion]oxyg[/deletion]
Nitrogene to form Ammonia
[Horizontal rule]
But Nitrous acid consists of 3 oxygene
& 1 Nitrogene
For every 5 of oxygene then
that Nitrous gas receives from water
it must give 6 Nitrogene-
to the Hydrogene of the water -
Now how much [deletion]oxy[/deletion] water will
100 grains of Nitrous gas decomposed. -
100 [deletion]cubic inches[/deletion] grains consist of 55,5
[deletion]N[/deletion]Oxygene & 44,5 Nitrogene -
this would require [deletion]51[/deletion] 50 more of oxygene
to form Nitrous acid.- -
Let x be the water then x
must be divided into two parts to each
