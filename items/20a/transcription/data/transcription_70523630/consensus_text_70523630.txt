soon began to form & in a short
time, [space left for insertion] was collected; now
accounting for the expansion from
increase of temperature this is nearly
the quantity employed. - on introducing
1/20 of oxygene nearly pure an absorbtion
almost compleat took place - From
this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it appears that Nitrous gas
[deletion]is not decompos[/deletion] forms no new combination
with water; for had Nitrate of
Ammonia been formed, a quantity of
Nitrous gas [deletion]suf[/deletion] = to that first
introduced could not have been
[deletion]formed[/deletion] in any way produced that
is existed is evident from the saturation
of the oxygene. - I was curious
to see if Nitrate of Ammonia
hindered the absorbtion of Nitrous gas
by water for this purpose [deletion]I boiled[/deletion]
I exposed Nitrous gas to a solution
of it which had been in ebullition
