Of the fall of Murray down
~ the Cataract ~
The night was dark I wandered through
the wood a miserable, a frantic
being, the dangers I had escaped
the terrible scene I had witnessed
The loss of the source of all
my joys united in my mind
in one painful emotion, I
reasoned not. I felt only my
organs of sense were useless to me
& I walked with instinctive
energy. - These feelings are
now almost wholy forgotten
The pains of that terrible night
are obliterated from my memory.
Wearied with sorrow & fatigue
