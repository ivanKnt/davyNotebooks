My sould became more heroic,
Had new dangers occurred I
should have gloried in meeting
them - the forest gr[deletion]eat[/deletion]adually grew
thinner. & at length a
lofty mountain appeared in front
& my ears were [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] with
the murmuring of a river
What [insertion]sublime[/insertion] pleasure filled my
tumultuous mind when I beheld
the [deletion]newly risen sun[/deletion] dancing
sunbeams trembling in the vast
expanse of waters. -
I walked triumphant along the
banks, I seemed united to nature
Nature in her beauties & no
longer a moral agent or
a miserable man: - but the
and my ears were saturated with
expanse of waters. ----
