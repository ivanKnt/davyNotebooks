It would be reasonable to conclude a priori that
when simple substances enter into chemical
union the attraction of the compound would
bear some relation to the affinities of
the constituents & if we apply this reasoning
to bodies as far as we are acquainted
With their component parts we shall
find it justified by the facts - Thus
in the combinations of the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] compound
acids with [insertion]Ammonia &[/insertion] the metallic oxides. we are
justified in concluding that the attraction
of the two combustible bases for each
other & their [deletion]seperate[/deletion] [insertion]reciprocal[/insertion] attraction [deletion]of the[/deletion]
[deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] for each other is the cause
of chemical combination - For instance
Sulphuric acid has a strong attraction
for Ammoniac; But the principles of Sulphuric
acid are sulphur & oxygene whilst the
principles of Ammoniac are Nitrogene &
Hydrogene: but Hydrogene has a strong
