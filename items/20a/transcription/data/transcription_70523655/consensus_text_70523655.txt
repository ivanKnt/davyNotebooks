attraction for sulphur & for oxygene
& Nitrogene has a strong attraction
for oxygene. -
May we not suppose then that
the[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] compound affinit[deletion]ies[/deletion]y [deletion]are[/deletion] results
from the sum of the simple affinities
& that [deletion]oxygen[/deletion] Nitrous acid combines -
with ammoniac because the oxygene
of the [deletion]Nitrous[/deletion] [insertion]Sulphuric[/insertion] acid is attracted by
the hydrogene; & [insertion]the[/insertion] sulphur by that
simple bodies cannot combine with two principles
at a time results from the strong affinity -
between two of them
When two bodies attract each other & are
attracted in different ratios by a third
No triple union can be formed provided
the point of saturation can be obtained
by one of these bodies; for these bodies still
exert their affinities on each other but these
affinities do not coalesce one of these is
much greater than the other - & in this
case ' a minute quantity only of the body
