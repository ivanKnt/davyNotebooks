Thus Nitrous gas is feeble attrac
water & Nitrous acid is strong
by water, whilst Nitrous gas is strong
attracted by Nitrous acid. -
So Nitrous gas is dispelled from Nitrous
acid by the superior attraction of water
for Nitric acid but still more
is combined than water alone can hold
in solution. -
Phosphorus does not decompose sulphuric acid because
it had a stronger affinity for sulphur. -
Sulphur & phosphorus do not decompose
the metallic oxides because, they have
a strong affinity for the metallic base. -
& both of these affinities must be excesised
at the same time. -
Charcoal decomposes most of the oxides &
acids because it has little affinity for
any of them & likewise hydrogene. -
which has a [deletion]f[/deletion] very feeble affinity - -
Iron decomposes water which sulphur & phosphorus do
not because they have affinity for hydrogene. -
