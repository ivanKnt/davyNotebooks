I awoke at midnight the recollection
of indistinct but painful visions
passed across my mind, the spectra
of horrible images still trembled on
my eyes, When I raised them to the
light that [deletion]trembled[/deletion][insertion]shone[/insertion] through the
green windows of my chamber. -
The moon was high in heaven, the
sky was blue & cloudless, [underline]the[/underline] woodbine 
that surrounded the casement
x was waving its dark foliage
[insertion]How intimately connected together[/insertion]
to the breeze - [deletion]how [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] was calm
[insertion]were light life & motion. - [/insertion]
[deletion]How rapidly do our feelings.[/deletion]
[insertion]I was no longer solitary[/insertion]
modify each other & coalesce. -
[insertion]no longer terrified.-[/insertion]
terror the restless & uncaring
feeling which [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] superstition [insertion]almost[/insertion] conquered
by reason is capable of awakening
in the mind disappeared before
the beautiful - or combined
with it to form sublime energy.
