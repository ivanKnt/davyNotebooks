modified consciousness be lost in
the immensity of being, No
my friend individuality can
never cease to exist , that
ideal self which exists in
dreams & reveries that ideal
self which never slumbers
x is the child of immortality
& these deep intense feelings
which man, sometimes perceives
in the bosom of Nature
& deity, are presentiments
of a more sublime &
energic state of existence. -
