no courage would be required to
enable him to pass through
the dreary church yard to
descend alone in the mouldering
vault containing the loath
some remains of humanity. -
but in the man whose
life has been in the civilised
word just the contrary =
What are courage &
fortitude; but the power
of modifying pain by
pleasure of anihilating fear
by hope
