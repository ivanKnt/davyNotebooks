I turn to your modern books, here
meet with neither sentiments
or ideas; but with dry collections
of terms deduced from [insertion]old[/insertion] books
much is all modern poetry, it
does not arise from a genuine
sympathy with nature, from
a fulness of soul, from a
wish to produce happiness
& [unclear]ametination[/unclear] amongst men
but from vanity from
the desire to be an author
Hence most bad poets love
no poetry but their own
hence every thing is modified
not by the feelings of
nature but by the feelings
