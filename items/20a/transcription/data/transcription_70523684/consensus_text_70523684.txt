The transferability of passion
Murderers of the human intellect
Have ye not [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] destroyed the union
existing between Nature & man -
Have ye not bound the children
of deity to the earth by the chains
of eternal labor - Have ye
not connected with all the sublime
all the beautiful - pain &
misery. The sun arises, his beams
glitter in the blue ocean, the
meadows are green with his light
but to the sons of labor He
does not shine, Their eyes
must be for ever fixed on
the barren [unclear]soil[/unclear] - few are
their [underline]enjoyments[/underline] few [underline]their[/underline] passions
