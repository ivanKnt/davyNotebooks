The knowledge of the laws of corpuscular
change will depend upon the discovery
of the ration between the diminution
of the attraction of the particles of
simple substances for each other [insertion]on change of temperature[/insertion] & for
those of other bodies & increase of temperature
& the the modifications of attractions
by new combinations. -
To discover this ratio it is necessary
to reason on the [insertion]more complex[/insertion] changes particularly
where those changes become eminently
different at different temperatures. -
The man who wishes to discover
truth must form an infinite
number of false hypotheses. -
