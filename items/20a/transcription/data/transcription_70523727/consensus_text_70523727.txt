the laws by which this property is governed. -
[Horizontal rule]
When two principles enter into chemical union
it is reasonable to suppose that their
compound attraction for other substances
will be modified by their attraction
for each other. - & this way principles
which have no attraction for each other
may be made to combine by the
intervention of a third principle. -
1. Attractions are not so modified by combination
but that the simple attractions still exist -
2[superscript]dly[/superscript] That those attractions diminish
[insertion]or increase as before[/insertion] with increase of temperature; - without a
new composition taking place. -
In this way the phaenomena of
the first decomposition of Nitrate of
Ammoniac must be explained all
chemical affinity must be solved by
attraction of simple principles. -
