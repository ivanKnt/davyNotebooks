Words are more difficultly remembered
in proportion as they consist of a
greater number of syllables; it
is therefore of the greatest importance
to render language as simple
as possible; but where the
names of compound substances
are derived from the names
of their constituents, [deletion]if the[/deletion] the shortest
[deletion]name of the consti[/deletion]
possible names shoud be given
to those constituents: otherwise
it will be impossible to
apply this principle of nomenclature
to very compound bodies -
In this respect the french
Nomenclature seems incapable
of application to any other part
