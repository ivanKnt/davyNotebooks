Lavorsier supposes; calls up trains
of obscure ideas connected with
some imagined process of acidification

of those properties; is thoroughly
convinced of its existence in
the Muriatic Fluoric & Boracic
acids and is astonished that
Sulphurated hydrogene [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] can exist as an acid without
[deletion]acid qualities[/deletion].-
