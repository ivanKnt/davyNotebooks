by the radiance of the sun of benevolence,
Are there any sufficiently cold hearted
to hearted to beleive this, let them
be idle, To us hope which though
it should be vain is yet an
eternal source [deletion]of action of consolation[/deletion]
[deletion]producing action [underline]action[/underline][/deletion] will
remain, It will for ever prompt
to actions, which though they should
deserve no laurels of triumph
from Mankind [deletion]&[/deletion] will never
have [deletion]deserved them[/deletion] raised them by watering
the earth with [deletion]their [/deletion]blood.
