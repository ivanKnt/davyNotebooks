The practice adopted by the french Nomenclators
of distinguishing simple substances by names
characterising their properties & compound ones
by terms expressing their composition
appears to me compleatly erroneous.
Let us only examine the name oxygene
or Generator of acids . A person unacquainted
with this substance, must to understand
what it is go thro' a series of
chemical facts to un[insertion]der[/insertion]stand ; but it
likewise prepossesses him with an
idea that He must afterwards correct
namely that all acids contain
more or less or it : whereas the
obvious properties by which it
is distinguished by the experimentalist
is its capability of supporting
combustion & its nonabsorbability
