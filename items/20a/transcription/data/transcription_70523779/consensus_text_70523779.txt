I some time ago proposed alterations
to the chemical nomenclature
these alterations I now renounce
altogether, now only because the
Theory upon which they are founded
is not capable of demonstration
But likewise ; because the logical
principles upon which they were
formed appear to be erroneous. -
Simplification of Nomenclature
appears in every sense a desideration
To clog a machine already too
complex with new wheels would
diminish its facility [deletion]of[/deletion] for expressing
ideas. -
