the a[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]ccumulation of electrical
fluid between the striking surfaces
& its rapid transmission to a
conducting body. - air or water -
But as it said that the electrical
fluid is not luminous in passing
thro' a torricellian vacuum - -
It is probable that my first
experiment, which was made
once in a vacuum much more
perfect than the torricellian
vacuum will be found strictly
accurate, the flint however certainly
was not sufficiently sharp to
suffer any of its particles to
be abraded; as no light
was produced in carbonic
acid.
