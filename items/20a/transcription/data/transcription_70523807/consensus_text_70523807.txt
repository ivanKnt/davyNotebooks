but on snapping it in common
air the light was as brilliant

acid; in the carbonic acid
no light was visible in
the air always bright sparks. -
On taking out this flint &
inserting in its place a very
long & sharp flint - a red
light was produced once or
twice: when it was snapped
in carbonic acid & once
when it was snapped under
but after 5 or six collisions
