The decomposition of Nitrous gas
by the Sulphures wetted iron &c
is too slow a process ever to be
employed with advantage
My Investigation on the Nitrous
oxyd - [deletion]&c[/deletion] will consist of experiments
on its production from the
decomposition of Nitrous acid &
Nitrous gas in different modes. -
Its analysis & the analysis of
the substances relating to it -
Its action on different incombustible
substances - On the combustion of
charcoal, Sulphur Phosphorus [insertion]Hydrogen[/insertion] &
iron & [unclear]x[/unclear] it, on its decomposition
by the , compound combustible bodies.
