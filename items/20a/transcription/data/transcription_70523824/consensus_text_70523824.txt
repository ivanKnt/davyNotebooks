The illustrious Berthollet discovered it
in the decomposition of Nitrate
of Ammonia -
To hope ever to be acquainted with
the variety of changes taking place in
the organic matter of the body
corresponding to the variety of perceptions
& [unclear]imitative[/unclear] motions is a vain presumption [insertion]which has existed for [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] 1000 years[/insertion]
As yet metaphysical science has been
unable to give a rational history
of them : as yet, - What the chemical
motions of inanimate matter are to the
mechanical, such are the motions of
life to the chemical ; they are
perhaps all governed by similar
laws & will be all finally explained
on the same principles at present
it is necessary to distinguish them
& to arrange them under different
heads.
