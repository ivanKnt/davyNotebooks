The dependance of Life upon the perpetual
assimilation of new principles with the blood
[deletion]and[/deletion] the alterations effected in those principles
by living [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]beings & the necessity of
supposing that some change must
take place in the nervous & muscular
fibre during sensitive & irritative action
concur to render propable the
supposition that the phaenomena
of life are capable of chemical
solution. -
But this supposition instead of inducing
us to form crude & hasty theories
concerning the nature of the changes
producing or connected with organic
action; ought to induce us rather
to confess altogether our inability
to solve the phaenomena of life
in the present state of our knowledge
