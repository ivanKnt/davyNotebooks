When we see one body presenting
a moving a variable sensation, striking
against another body so as to produce
motion on it we call it cause
& effect we call the motion connected
ie when we have uniformly beheld
two ideas associated together we call
them cause & effect, whenever two
sensations are variable with respect
to the order of association well
reason differently concerning them. -
they are no longer necessarily connected
Our knowledge is little indeed &
scepticism with regard to theory is
what we ought most religiously
to adhere to,
