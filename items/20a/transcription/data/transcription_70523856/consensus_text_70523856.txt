We ought to reason from effects alone
ie concerning sensations, false Philosophy
has uniformly depended upon making use
| of words which signify no definite
| sensations or ideas. Men associate them
| together in the order they are accustomed
| to do & affix to them no accurate
| sensations or ideas. -
| Calorique ought to be the association
| together
The common Man attaches to the
word heat the particular sensation which
He feels as bring any of his organs in
contact with a heated body. & by fire
He means heat & Light by light without
heat he means his peculiar visible idea.
The philosopher is not content with
perceiving sensations He searches for the
cause of them, now let us examine
into the nature of cause & effect
