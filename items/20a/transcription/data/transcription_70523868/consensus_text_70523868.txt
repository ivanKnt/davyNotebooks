Sulphur is a body existing in the state of
Solidity at the common temperature of the
atmosphere . In its pure state it is
opaque & nearly white its specific gravity
is [space left for insertion] - Sulphur becomes fluid at
the temperature of - [space left for insertion]Â° . & gaseous at
In its gaseous form it is capable of
decomposing phosoxygen & of attracting
oxygen from many of its combinations -
When Sulphur in the gaseous form
is brought in contact with phosoxygen
it rapidly [deletion]attracts[/deletion] seperates the oxygen
from the Light. combines with it &
forms sulphuric acid whilst the
light is liberated in the repulsive
projectile form - Sulphur appears
capable of combining with three different
portions of oxygen, when its combustion
is very slowly carried on . the phosoxygen
is slowly decomposed & the sulphur combines
