On the increase of
repulsive motion in [unclear]bodies[/unclear] from friction
Mechanical motion as we have said before
is a [deletion]repulsive[/deletion] motion communicated to all
the particles of the body tending to move
them from some other body or bodies
Now when [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] one body strikes against
another it communicates repulsive motion
to the exterior strata of particles
this motion is instantaneously communicated
to the rest & so on The difficulty with
which a body is moved depends upon its
quantity of gravitating matter when a
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] when two = bodies meet with [deletion]different[/deletion] =
velocities all their motion is lost ; but not
anihilated, for the particles no longer
being capable of rectilineal motion take
the vibratory mtion & become expanded
so that friction is nothing more than
a successive communication of repulsive
rectilineal [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] motion to bodies that are incapable
of communicating it. & so on -
This is a very imperfect account
of the business - [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]
