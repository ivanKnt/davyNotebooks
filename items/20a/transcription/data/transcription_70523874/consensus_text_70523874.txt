a cube of iron 1/3 is capable of
expanding a cubic inch of air
so as to make it exist in four

[Ink sketches]

In what [deletion]way[/deletion] if you admit it to be simply repulsive
& as [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] of Matter you will then concede
to our theory, that produces no other effects than
[unclear]repulsion[/unclear].
