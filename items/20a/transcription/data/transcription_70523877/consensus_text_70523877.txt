its power of subtracting heat increases
for as the temperature of atmosphere
depends both on the heat communi-
-cated to it from opaque
solid bodies & from the communication
of the repulsive motion of light
passing thro it & as this communication
is proportional to its density
so the temperature of the
atmosphere must decrease in
proportion as its density & Distance
from the earth diminishes -

[deletion]in contact[/deletion][insertion]with[/insertion] with bodies of a lower
temperature these will subtract its
repulsive motion: & when its repulsive
motion is subtracted to a certain
degree it then comes in equilibrium
with the attraction of gravitation
