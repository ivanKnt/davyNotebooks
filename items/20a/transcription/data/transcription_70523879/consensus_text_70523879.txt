acted on by a vibratory motion
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] This vibratory motion must tend
to move them from the gravitating
matter of the globe - Their expansibility
in their expansion mut be limited
but their ascending power must
be continually the same -
This much investigated .
We mu[unclear]st[/unclear] next enquire how
the corpuscles of bodies do not tend
 indefinitely to sepirate from the gravitating
matter of the globe. - That is how
gases are not absolutely repuls[unclear]ive[/unclear]
projectile fluids - Hydrogen gas
in its active moving gaseous form
[unclear]possess[/unclear] a power of commmunicating
repulsive motion to bodies of a
lower temperature - Now in
proportion as the distance of the
atmosphere from the earth increases
