Our sensations inform us of the existence
of active power our organs do not come
in contact with the bodies they perceive
For if they did they must necessarily
combine with their particles . & we find
that even the particles [insertion]themselves[/insertion] of bodies [deletion][unclear]that[/unclear][/deletion]
are not in actual contact for
they can be made to exist in
less space by diminishing their repulsion
We are conscious then of the existence of
a property by which beings [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] produce
in us sensations ie Repulsion [deletion]as[/deletion] [unclear]if[/unclear] likewise
There was no power but Repulsion the
bodies exist in a state [deletion]of in [unclear]axxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
particles would indefinitely seperate this
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
other property [deletion]of Matter[/deletion] may be called
Attraction. We shall give to the beings
possessing attraction & repulsion the name
of particles we consider all the laws
of [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] being as the simple laws of attraction
& Repulsion -
