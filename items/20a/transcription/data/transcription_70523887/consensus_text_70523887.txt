Let there be two cubes A & B
Let A move with a velocity a
Let B be at rest in space -
Then the quantity of motion in
it is the sum of the motions of
its particles. Let the motion of
each particle be c & the number
of particles d - then dc = a
[Ink sketch]
Whilst the attraction remains the
same a communication of motion
to the external strata of particles will
not cause them to approximate; to the
next strata.
