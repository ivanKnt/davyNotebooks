gained by one body is that lost by
the other - A body cannot be
moved without every particle of it
is moved. The particles of a body cannot
be syncronically moved [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]unless they synchronicaly
receive an impulse- The impulse
of mechanical motion is not communicated
to every particle because certain [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
approximation is essential to this and
bodies do not [deletion]move[/deletion] [insertion]act on each other mechanically[/insertion] unless they are
in apparent contact- [unclear]Is then[/unclear] all the
particles of a body in motion move
so when a moving body communicates
motion every particle must communicate
motion; but as particles cannot act
on each other but when in certain
distance- The mechanical communication
of motion must be occasioned by the
successive rapid communication of
motion from each strata of particles
