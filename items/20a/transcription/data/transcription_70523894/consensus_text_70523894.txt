Their contiguity & consequent near attraction
preserve the equilibrium between attraction
& repulsive motion - there must be
uniform equilibrium - distances of corpuscles
To investigate if the attraction of corpuscles decreases
in the ratio of their distance it would be necessary
to assume certain principles & investigate the
phaenomena of expansion on these principles
& then compare all the phaenomena & discover
whether they were explicable or not. -
1 Expansion is the only measure of increased
repulsive motion.
2 Temperature is the power of a body to
communicate or receive repulsive motion.
3 What has been called capacity for heat & by
Seguin Capacity of bodies to contain calorique
within their molecules is nothing more
Than the translation of temperature. -
Philosophy is simple & intelligible it is
only to the [unclear]men[/unclear] of confused ideas that
we are indebted for confused unintelligible
systems. V. - Elasticity not generally
understood. it depends on the number of particles
coming in contact with a body of a lower
temperature, & expansibility on the power of
attracting Heat -
