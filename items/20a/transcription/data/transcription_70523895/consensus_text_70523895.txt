hence we find how light which possesses the
greatest quantity of repulsive motion of any
body does not heat but in its concentrated
state. Latent motion no absurdity
exists in every part of matter even on
the Theory of caloric.-
The attractions of bodies may in a state of
C C. be less than the attractions of the simple
substances forming them in solids may form a
fluid or a gas.- Temperature not at all
understood. Whether absolute attraction diminishes
in proportion as repulsive motion encreases.-
investigation, the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] gravitation does not diminish
proof of this. attraction of corpuscles necessarily
The superior particles of a fluid must be less
acted on by gravitation than the lower ones if
all the particles of a fluid are equidistant
Then must the attractions of the superior
particles be greater than that of the inferior
ones. There is + to their attraction that of
all the inferior particles which probably from
