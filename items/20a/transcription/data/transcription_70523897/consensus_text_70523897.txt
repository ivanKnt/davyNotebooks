as bodies have greater quantities of repulsive
motion they possess the power of affecting our
senses by a smaller number of particles.
Solid & fluid bodies affect our senses by
mechanical impulse. - Solids & fluids are
more immediately the objects [deletion]the[/deletion] of touch

sound. The emanations from odorous bodies
which in the laws of their motions approach
to some repulsive projection [insertion]produce the sensations of smell.[/insertion] - Light from whence
all our sensations of color arise exists in the true
state of repulsive projection - When bodies combine

of the compound possess a quantity of matter
equal to the united particles of the constituents.-
If then the united particles are incapable of as great
a quantity of repulsive motion as the individual
particles repulsive motion will be communicated
to the bodies in contact - Limits of temperature
a new discovery: could gold be rendered
gaseous it would probably be incapapable
of communicating so much heat as in its
fluid state - Repulsive motion communicated
Taste must depend on the communication of
