         <p>Later known as 'laughing gas'. Davy discovered that nitrous oxide was respirable when
            not contaminated with nitric oxide (NO). Davy researched into the physiological effects
            of nitrous oxide.</p>

         <p>American chemist, botanist, natural historian and botanist, who studied medicine at
