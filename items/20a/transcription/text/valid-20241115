[Tiny ink sketch of face in profile]
To carry on accurate investigations
concerning the action of different substances
on the animal oeconomy, it is essential
to be well acquainted with their
composition & chemical properties.-
otherwise we are in no ways calculated
to discover the effected changes
which is always the end proposed
Hence much of this volume
will be found to be occupied by
chemical investigations which to
the superficial observer appear
unconnected with the phaenomena
of life. It will not however be
paradoxical to assert that it is
from our ignorance of the composition
& properties of inorganic matter that

remained it would form Nitrous
acid with the 66; but
[deletion]22[/deletion]
take 22 from 34 & the
remainder is 12
12 Nitrogene remains then; but
this must decompose water by the
attraction of one part of it for
the oxygene of the water &
by the attraction of the other
part of it for the hydrogene

[page]77|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00077|dnp20a077pp|70523591[/page]

But the water must be
divided into two parts to each
other as 15 to 85.
& 15 of hydrogene require
8.5 of Nitrogene to form ammonia. -
but if the Nitrogene be divided
in this way it evident that
the oxygene must be 8.5 & consequently
will be superabundant. -
I discovered this Night that
Nitrous acid has a stronger affinity
for the oxyd of iron than Sulphuric
acid & that when it combines
with the [deletion]sulphuric acid[/deletion]. Nitrous
acid it must be oxydated to a
greater extent & in this oxydation
produces from a concentrated acid
Nitrous gas or gaseous oxyd.-

[page]78|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00078|dnp20a078pp|70523593[/page]
it is the attraction of this
for the oxygene of the water
that enables Sulphate of iron
to absorb Nitrous gas, the
Nascent hydrogene attracts the
[deletion]oxygene[/deletion] [insertion]Nitrogene[/insertion] of the Nitrous gas
which is consequently converted
into Nitrous acid. -
100 Nitrous gas suppose this
formed into Nitrous acid & Nitrogene [deletion]by[/deletion]
then the Nitrogene must be divided
into two parts one of which must combine
with 85 of oxygene to form Nitrous acid
& the other with 15 of Hydrogene to
form Ammonia; but 85 of oxygene

therefore x : d : [deletion]d[/deletion] y : b

In speaking of the changes producing the
phaenomena of life; we speak of things
wholy unknown to us. we are as much
in the dark concerning them as we
are with regard to the ideas of
an animal possessing no means
of communicating His thoughts.-
The first enquiry then must be
concerning our capability of becoming
acquainted with them & the
mode of investigation to be pursued-
The demonstration of our capabilities
would present to the human mind
the most glorious & sublime
prospects If by examining the
changes effected in a nerve of
a muscle during animated action
we should be able to demonstrate

[page]80|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00080|dnp20a080pp|70523596[/page]
that certain combinations took place
which from their nature [deletion]might[/deletion]
produce contraction & if we were
capable of producing the irritable
contraction again, then irritability
might be considered as a chemical
change; but if we could neither
ascertain that a particular
change had taken place or
[deletion]that[/deletion] if we could not again
produce that habit of change
by chemical agents we must
then beleive that the changes
producing irritable action [deletion]are exactly[/deletion]
are not analogous to chemical
attractions: but that they depend upon
certain qualities of matter or upon
certain agents with which we
are not acquainted by our senses.-

physiology is the most important of
the Sciences - but we are as yet
ignorant of it & we have not yet
discovered even the modes in which
the investigation must be pursued-

Observations on the changes
effected in Nitrate of Ammonia by
Heat. -
At temperatures [deletion]about[/deletion] 300[superscript][unclear]o[/unclear][/superscript] [insertion]280. solid[/insertion] the Nitrate of
Ammonia is fluid between 300 & 310
it slowly sublimes & between 310 & [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
to perhaps 600[deletion][unclear]or[/unclear][/deletion] 700 its is decomposed
into Water & Nitrous oxyd. whilst a [insertion]little free acid is disengaged[/insertion]
with little or no increase of temperature
during this decomposition . between the
[deletion]white[/deletion] heat & [deletion]7[/deletion] 6 or 700 it is decomposed
into water, & Nitrous oxyd. [deletion]whilst[/deletion] with
Nitrogenated acid Nitrous gas & Nitrogene
whilst light is produced & apparent
increase of temperature takes place. -
Perhaps no part of chemistry is more obscure
than that relating to the different
arrangements produced in the same principles
at different temperatures, Nitrous acid

[page]84|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00084|dnp20a084pp|70523603[/page]
and Ammonia two gases by entering
into combination produce a solid compound
whilst they produce a considerable increase
of temperature, fluid at 308 they
assume a new form of existence &
two new bodies exist having but
a feeble affinity for each other
& one of them incapable of alteration
by any substance in nature beside
except at a very high temperature.
It appears then that those reciprocal
attractions ie that of Nitrogene for
[deletion]Ammonia[/deletion] [insertion]Hydrogene[/insertion], that of oxygene for Hydrogene
& of oxygene for Nitrogene are dissolved.
instead of them the oxygene.
The attraction of Hydrogene for Nitrogene
is we know weakened by heat for oxygene
increased; but temperatures below 400
do not decompose any of the combinations
of oxygene & Nitrogene hence it appears

[page]85|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00085|dnp20a085pp|70523605[/page]
85
From the formation of Nitre it appears that
oxygene & Nitrogene somehow combine at the
common temperature. - when 1 part of a
fluid is rapidly expanded. [unclear][deletion]&[/deletion][/unclear]by the transmission
of the electric spark through it it must
[deletion]immediate[/deletion] produce approximation of
other parts of it
that a considerable affinity exists
between those two bodies at that
temperature - Hence the Nitrogene combines
with the remaining oxygene to form NItrous oxyd -
The exact points of saturation prove that
the affinity exercised by bodies must be
compound & that certain sums of Attraction
correspondend.. in at[superscript]c[/superscript] air 27 parts of oxygene
are combined with 73 Nitrogene here it would
appear that the affinity of many particles
of nitrogen are divided upon one of oxygene
In nitrous oxyd which is more condensed
the affinity is stronger & the body more

[page]86|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00086|dnp20a086pp|70523607[/page]
condensed. here the affinity of oxygene
prevails rather more in Nitrous gas
the affinity is sufficient to prevent
it from being decomposed by heat.
& by most combustible bodies, tho
bodies which attract oxygene slowly
at the common temperature are
capable of decomposing it. -
Nitrous acid seems to be the result
of the union of Nitrous gas with
Oxygene, this union takes place at
the common temperature it is dissolved
likewise at the common temperature
& in some cases where the bodies
attract oxygene strongly the Nitrous
gas is decomposed

[page]87|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00087|dnp20a087pp|70523608[/page]
87
supposing at [superscript][unclear]c[/unclear][/superscript]air then a chemical compound
it consists of oxygene held down by many
particles of Nitrogene whose attraction
for it is less intimate from its
division - consequently in this compound
the oxygene is easily seperated from
the Nitrogene -
In Nitrous oxyd on the contrary
perhaps nearly equal quantities of
oxygene & Nitrogene are attracted by
equal forces. Hence this body is
extremely difficult of decomposition &
has but little affinities for other
bodies [deletion]its[unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] & is [insertion]consequently more[/insertion] more condensed
than Nitrous gas or A[superscript]tc[/superscript] air - it
never gives out Nitrogene to form
Ammonia & is only decomposable by
strong oxygene attractions at high temp[superscript][unclear]x[/unclear][/superscript] -
Nitrous gas we may consider as oxygene
attract[deletion]ing[/deletion][insertion]ed[/insertion] small quantities of Nitrogene

[page]88|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00088|dnp20a088pp|70523610[/page]
[deletion][unclear]but[/unclear][/deletion]. The oxygene is not easily taken
from the Nitrogene; but the
Nitrogene by being attracted by
many particles has little affinity for
once hence it is seperated by hydrogen
to form ammonia.-
The Nitrous gas is not decomposable
by [insertion]Red[/insertion] heat as is the gas [unclear][insertion]x[/insertion][/unclear] oxyd into
Nitrous acid & common air -
but at high heat into Nitrous
acid & Nitrogene: hence it appears
that the mass of the attractions
of Nitrogene are less in Nitrous
gas.
[Horizontal rule]
Quere in that expt in which gaseous oxide
is converted into [deletion]Nitrous[/deletion] common air is not
water decomposed the oxygene of which combines
with the Nitrous gas of the gaseous oxyd - & in Nitrous

is it not probable that the substance
existing in nature capable of assuming
the form of Light exists in all the
airs; & that the electric fluid or
that modification of motion or whatever
it be by communicating to it a
rapid motion gives it projection.-
[underline]hence the gases become[/underline] condensed & combine.-
but Nitrous acid itself is decomposed
at the [unclear]red[/unclear]. Quere if Nitrous acid

The different attractions of aeriform fluids [insertion]for water[/insertion]
& their consequent difference of volume

In the following sections I shall detail
experiments by which the changes
taking place, in the agents in processes
already made known will be ascertained;
[deletion]if[/deletion] new facts demonstrated & the
rationale of these facts explained. -
On the absorbtion of Nitrous gas
by Water. -
In his ingenious paper on Eudiometry
Humbold has asserted, that [deletion]when[/deletion]

[page]98|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00098|dnp20a098pp|70523627[/page]
Nitrous gas [deletion]is absorbed by water, a[/deletion]

& that [deletion]when a[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] small quantity of it
[deletion]of it[/deletion] [insertion]which[/insertion] disappears when [insertion]it is[/insertion] brought in
contact with [deletion]water[/deletion] [insertion]that fluid[/insertion] [deletion]it[/deletion] is owing
to the formation of Nitrate of
Ammonia, resulting from the combination
of the oxygene of water with [deletion]a certain[/deletion]
[deletion]portion of[/deletion] the oxygene & a certain
portion of the Nitrogene of the Nitrous
gas to form Nitrous acid: & of
its hydrogene with another portion
of the Nitrogene to form Ammonia. -
This opinion He grounds upon exp[superscript]t[/superscript].
& affirms that both He & [unclear]Tassaert[/unclear]
detected by accurate tests the presence
of those two substances. -
I must own that the [deletion]difficulty[/deletion] minute
quantities of Nitrous gas absorbable
by water; & its limit of Absorbtion
[deletion]made me sceptical with regard[/deletion]

[deletion]to this fact & It was necessary for me[/deletion]
[deletion]to[/deletion] & the perfect isolation of the 99
phaenomenon made me sceptical
with regard to it - To remove
this scepticism, I distilled six ounces
of water that had been long in
ebullition; & condensed it under a
cylinder filled with mercury, [deletion]it[/deletion]
[deletion]could consequently contain no ascertainable[/deletion]
[deletion]quantity of air[/deletion] suffering a considerable
quantity of steam to pass thro
the mercury before any was condensed
for use, that no air might
remain in the retort. - [deletion][unclear]to[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]over[/insertion] this
water 1/10 of a cubic inch of

after much agitation & consequent
rest for hours [unclear]&[/unclear] remained.

time, [space left for insertion] was collected; now
accounting for the expansion from
increase of temperature this is nearly
the quantity employed. - on introducing
1/20 of oxygene nearly pure an absorbtion
almost compleat took place - From
this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it appears that Nitrous gas
[deletion]is not decompos[/deletion] forms no new combination
with water; for had Nitrate of
Ammonia been formed, a quantity of
Nitrous gas [deletion]suf[/deletion] = to that first
introduced could not have been
[deletion]formed[/deletion] in any way produced that
is existed is evident from the saturation
of the oxygene. - I was curious
to see if Nitrate of Ammonia
hindered the absorbtion of Nitrous gas
by water for this purpose [deletion]I boiled[/deletion]
I exposed Nitrous gas to a solution
of it which had been in ebullition

[page]101|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00101|dnp20a101pp|70523632[/page]

it was absorbed nearly to the same
extent as by pure water. -
I did not try Humbolts experiment
of [deletion]saturating[/deletion] [insertion]adding lime to the[/insertion] the solution. heating it
& ascertaining whether it whitened
Muriatic fumes. - Experience has c
convinced me that if such a quantity

Nitrate of Ammonia with water
& [deletion]suspended[/deletion] dissolved in such a

the [unclear]dephlogistication [/unclear] of Nitrous acid by

It would be reasonable to conclude a priori that
when simple substances enter into chemical
union the attraction of the compound would
bear some relation to the affinities of
the constituents & if we apply this reasoning
to bodies as far as we are acquainted
With their component parts we shall
find it justified by the facts - Thus
in the combinations of the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] compound
acids with [insertion]Ammonia &[/insertion] the metallic oxides. we are
justified in concluding that the attraction
of the two combustible bases for each
other & their [deletion]seperate[/deletion] [insertion]reciprocal[/insertion] attraction [deletion]of the[/deletion]
[deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] for each other is the cause
of chemical combination - For instance
Sulphuric acid has a strong attraction
for Ammoniac; But the principles of Sulphuric
acid are sulphur & oxygene whilst the
principles of Ammoniac are Nitrogene &
Hydrogene: but Hydrogene has a strong

[page]118|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00118|dnp20a118pp|70523655[/page]
attraction for sulphur & for oxygene
& Nitrogene has a strong attraction
for oxygene. -
May we not suppose then that
the[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] compound affinit[deletion]ies[/deletion]y [deletion]are[/deletion] results
from the sum of the simple affinities
& that [deletion]oxygen[/deletion] Nitrous acid combines -
with ammoniac because the oxygene
of the [deletion]Nitrous[/deletion] [insertion]Sulphuric[/insertion] acid is attracted by
the hydrogene; & [insertion]the[/insertion] sulphur by that
simple bodies cannot combine with two principles
at a time results from the strong affinity -
between two of them
When two bodies attract each other & are
attracted in different ratios by a third
No triple union can be formed provided
the point of saturation can be obtained
by one of these bodies; for these bodies still
exert their affinities on each other but these
affinities do not coalesce one of these is
much greater than the other - & in this
case ' a minute quantity only of the body

[page]119|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00119|dnp20a119pp|70523656[/page]
will combine. - 119
Thus Nitrous gas is feeble attrac
water & Nitrous acid is strong
by water, whilst Nitrous gas is strong
attracted by Nitrous acid. -
So Nitrous gas is dispelled from Nitrous
acid by the superior attraction of water
for Nitric acid but still more
is combined than water alone can hold
in solution. -
Phosphorus does not decompose sulphuric acid because
it had a stronger affinity for sulphur. -
Sulphur & phosphorus do not decompose
the metallic oxides because, they have
a strong affinity for the metallic base. -
& both of these affinities must be excesised
at the same time. -
Charcoal decomposes most of the oxides &
acids because it has little affinity for
any of them & likewise hydrogene. -
which has a [deletion]f[/deletion] very feeble affinity - -
Iron decomposes water which sulphur & phosphorus do
not because they have affinity for hydrogene. -

inciples combine, their simple attractions
destroyed but only modified by their
state of existence. -
The truth of this principle appears to me
to be proved by all the phaenomena
of single affinity. -
2. No two compound bodies can combine
unless their simple principles have affinity
for each other. -
3. That the attractions which produce
the combinations of compound substances
are attractions of simple principles for
each other. -

[unclear]xx[/unclear] changing temperature. -
The knowledge of the laws of corpuscular
change will depend upon the discovery
of the ration between the diminution
of the attraction of the particles of
simple substances for each other [insertion]on change of temperature[/insertion] & for
those of other bodies & increase of temperature
& the the modifications of attractions
by new combinations. -
To discover this ratio it is necessary
to reason on the [insertion]more complex[/insertion] changes particularly
where those changes become eminently
different at different temperatures. -
The man who wishes to discover
truth must form an infinite
number of false hypotheses. -

[page]176|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00176|dnp20a178pp|70523726[/page]
As far as we are acquainted with
corpuscular changes, they appear to depend
on two principles Attraction; & expansion. -
or seperation of particles. -
Waving any discussion concerning the
nature of these principles which has
no connection with true philosophy. -
It is evident that we have no power
of altering the attractions of simple
principles whilst the power of giving
them repulsion on the contrary
is in a great measure in our hands. -
By giving this repulsion we in all
cases diminish the attractions of
homogeneal particles for each other. -
whilst in many cases we are [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] capable
of increasing the attraction of heterogeneal
particles; so that our power of forming
combinations depends upon our power

the laws by which this property is governed. -
[Horizontal rule]
When two principles enter into chemical union
it is reasonable to suppose that their
compound attraction for other substances
will be modified by their attraction
for each other. - & this way principles
which have no attraction for each other
may be made to combine by the
intervention of a third principle. -
1. Attractions are not so modified by combination
but that the simple attractions still exist -
2[superscript]dly[/superscript] That those attractions diminish
[insertion]or increase as before[/insertion] with increase of temperature; - without a
new composition taking place. -
In this way the phaenomena of
the first decomposition of Nitrate of
Ammoniac must be explained all
chemical affinity must be solved by
attraction of simple principles. -

Words are more difficultly remembered

it will be impossible to

it contains some other principle -
In the new nomenclature, the simple
substances to which new names
have been given instead of being
characterised by obvious properties; have
been named with refference to
properties the knowledge of which
requires a long series of examinations!
It is not by the acidifying power
of oxygene that the experimentalist
detects its existence, it is by
its non absorbability by water
& diminution with Nitrous gas
or capability of supporting

Were we advanced to that point
in science at which we could
saffely consider a certain number

be admissable to give to those

The practice adopted by the french Nomenclators

appears to me compleatly erroneous.
Let us only examine the name oxygene
or Generator of acids . A person unacquainted
with this substance, must to understand
what it is go thro' a series of
chemical facts to un[insertion]der[/insertion]stand ; but it
likewise prepossesses him with an
idea that He must afterwards correct
namely that all acids contain
more or less or it : whereas the
obvious properties by which it
is distinguished by the experimentalist
is its capability of supporting
combustion & its nonabsorbability

would result from it our
names must necessarily be
compound. - & supposing that
compound substances should be
charactised by names expressing
the combination, this mode
would lead to a confusion
of Languge great as that
which took place at Babel. -
Polysyllabic names are not only
difficult to remember; but the
act of recalling them very often
produces perplexity & sometimes
loose analogies by calling up
similar sounds. . - Hence if

[page]218|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00218|dnp20a220pp|70523777[/page]
If then the names of substances are to
be formed from their properties, they
should be from properties which are
readily perceived & which have no
relation to a number of facts.
The weight of bodies compared with
some [insertion]other[/insertion] simple property would be
always sufficient, to characterise
them indeed the greater number
of simple substances may be characterised
by very simple & obvious properties. -
We do not distinguish oxygene gas
from other airs by its properties of

substances are known from each

properties, there it evident the
name had better be derived
from some properties the knowledge

Then the quantity of motion in

Whilst the attraction remains the
same a communication of motion
to the external strata of particles will
not cause them to approximate; to the
next strata.

gained by one body is that lost by
the other - A body cannot be
moved without every particle of it
is moved. The particles of a body cannot
be syncronically moved [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]unless they synchronicaly
receive an impulse- The impulse
of mechanical motion is not communicated
to every particle because certain [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
approximation is essential to this and
bodies do not [deletion]move[/deletion] [insertion]act on each other mechanically[/insertion] unless they are
in apparent contact- [unclear]Is then[/unclear] all the
particles of a body in motion move
so when a moving body communicates
motion every particle must communicate
motion; but as particles cannot act
on each other but when in certain
distance- The mechanical communication
of motion must be occasioned by the
successive rapid communication of
motion from each strata of particles

Of the Communication
- of Motion -
When a body moves every particle
of which it is composed must necessarily
change place [deletion]x[/deletion] ie move thro space
Motion is the approximation or
elongation of one body ie mass of
particles to or from others, a body
however may be conceived to move thro
space tho there existed no other body
We become sensible of motion from
the successive communication of repulsive
motions to different parts of our organs.-

Their contiguity & consequent near attraction
preserve the equilibrium between attraction
& repulsive motion - there must be
uniform equilibrium - distances of corpuscles
To investigate if the attraction of corpuscles decreases
in the ratio of their distance it would be necessary
to assume certain principles & investigate the
phaenomena of expansion on these principles
& then compare all the phaenomena & discover
whether they were explicable or not. -
1 Expansion is the only measure of increased
repulsive motion.
2 Temperature is the power of a body to
communicate or receive repulsive motion.
3 What has been called capacity for heat & by
Seguin Capacity of bodies to contain calorique
within their molecules is nothing more
Than the translation of temperature. -
Philosophy is simple & intelligible it is
only to the [unclear]men[/unclear] of confused ideas that
we are indebted for confused unintelligible
systems. V. - Elasticity not generally
understood. it depends on the number of particles
coming in contact with a body of a lower
temperature, & expansibility on the power of
attracting Heat -

in the ratio of the number of particles in contact
 & their velocity. [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Another new discovery
hence we find how light which possesses the
greatest quantity of repulsive motion of any
body does not heat but in its concentrated
state. Latent motion no absurdity
exists in every part of matter even on
the Theory of caloric.-
The attractions of bodies may in a state of
C C. be less than the attractions of the simple
substances forming them in solids may form a
fluid or a gas.- Temperature not at all
understood. Whether absolute attraction diminishes
in proportion as repulsive motion encreases.-
investigation, the [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] gravitation does not diminish
proof of this. attraction of corpuscles necessarily
The superior particles of a fluid must be less
acted on by gravitation than the lower ones if
all the particles of a fluid are equidistant
Then must the attractions of the superior
particles be greater than that of the inferior
ones. There is + to their attraction that of
all the inferior particles which probably from

[page]298|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00298|dnp20a300pp|70523897[/page]
as bodies have greater quantities of repulsive
motion they possess the power of affecting our
senses by a smaller number of particles.
Solid & fluid bodies affect our senses by
mechanical impulse. - Solids & fluids are
more immediately the objects [deletion]the[/deletion] of touch
[deletion][underline]Gases[/underline] of the[/deletion] the vibrating motions of gases produce
sound. The emanations from odorous bodies
which in the laws of their motions approach

all our sensations of color arise exists in the true
state of repulsive projection - When bodies combine
[deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] the individual relatively homogeneal particles
of the compound possess a quantity of matter
equal to the united particles of the constituents.-
If then the united particles are incapable of as great
a quantity of repulsive motion as the individual
particles repulsive motion will be communicated
to the bodies in contact - Limits of temperature
a new discovery: could gold be rendered
gaseous it would probably be incapapable
of communicating so much heat as in its

The rapid changes in our organs connected

altogether out of the power of our

[Tiny ink sketch of face in profile]
To carry on accurate investigations
concerning the action of different substances
on the animal oeconomy, it is essential
to be well acquainted with their
composition & chemical properties.-
otherwise we are in no ways calculated
to discover the effected changes
which is always the end proposed
Hence much of this volume
will be found to be occupied by
chemical investigations which to
the superficial observer appear
unconnected with the phaenomena
of life. It will not however be
paradoxical to assert that it is
from our ignorance of the composition
& properties of inorganic matter that

[page]46|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00046|dnp20a046pp|70523536[/page]
our ignorance of many points
in physiology [unclear]arises[/unclear]. Were we well
acquainted with the composition
of that gas absorbed in respiration
& had we settled our ideas
concerning the nature of heat
such a number of Theories
of respiration would not have
been formed. -
A great variety of coarse
physiological exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] sufficient perhaps
to fill a volume twice as
large as the present might
have been made in half the

labor devoted to these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. -

but whether they would have
established so many useful truths
must remain a matter of
doubt. -
The properties as well as the
composition of the newagent
which may be considered as
the most important fact
of those exp.[superscript]ts[/superscript] - surely demanded
a full investigation & I think
that the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
Ammonical salts & their

x towards clearing the way to
the science of [underline]complex affinity[/underline]
which is in fact. the Chemistry

from each other we can hardly hope
to discover by generalisations the
changes infinitely more complex
produces in living beings -
Hence the first steps towards the
progress of the science of animated
Nature must depend upon the perfection

principles [unclear]undecompounded[/unclear] in their

Hence the changes effected in the blood

supplies words without meaning to
express the causes of certain effects

the phaenomena of nature will
I doubt not rather extend

The attraction of Hydrogene for Nitrogene
is we know weakened by heat for oxygene
increased; but temperatures below 400
do not decompose any of the combinations
of oxygene & Nitrogene hence it appears

From the formation of Nitre it appears that
oxygene & Nitrogene somehow combine at the
common temperature. - when 1 part of a
fluid is rapidly expanded. [unclear][deletion]&[/deletion][/unclear]by the transmission
of the electric spark through it it must
[deletion]immediate[/deletion] produce approximation of
other parts of it
that a considerable affinity exists
between those two bodies at that
temperature - Hence the Nitrogene combines
with the remaining oxygene to form NItrous oxyd -
The exact points of saturation prove that
the affinity exercised by bodies must be
compound & that certain sums of Attraction
correspondend.. in at[superscript]c[/superscript] air 27 parts of oxygene
are combined with 73 Nitrogene here it would
appear that the affinity of many particles
of nitrogen are divided upon one of oxygene
In nitrous oxyd which is more condensed
the affinity is stronger & the body more

[page]86|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00086|dnp20a086pp|70523607[/page]
condensed. here the affinity of oxygene
prevails rather more in Nitrous gas
the affinity is sufficient to prevent
it from being decomposed by heat.
& by most combustible bodies, tho
bodies which attract oxygene slowly
at the common temperature are
capable of decomposing it. -
Nitrous acid seems to be the result
of the union of Nitrous gas with
Oxygene, this union takes place at
the common temperature it is dissolved
likewise at the common temperature
& in some cases where the bodies
attract oxygene strongly the Nitrous
gas is decomposed

supposing at [superscript][unclear]c[/unclear][/superscript]air then a chemical compound
it consists of oxygene held down by many
particles of Nitrogene whose attraction
for it is less intimate from its
division - consequently in this compound
the oxygene is easily seperated from
the Nitrogene -
In Nitrous oxyd on the contrary
perhaps nearly equal quantities of
oxygene & Nitrogene are attracted by
equal forces. Hence this body is
extremely difficult of decomposition &
has but little affinities for other
bodies [deletion]its[unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] & is [insertion]consequently more[/insertion] more condensed
than Nitrous gas or A[superscript]tc[/superscript] air - it
never gives out Nitrogene to form
Ammonia & is only decomposable by
strong oxygene attractions at high temp[superscript][unclear]x[/unclear][/superscript] -
Nitrous gas we may consider as oxygene
attract[deletion]ing[/deletion][insertion]ed[/insertion] small quantities of Nitrogene

[page]88|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00088|dnp20a088pp|70523610[/page]
[deletion][unclear]but[/unclear][/deletion]. The oxygene is not easily taken
from the Nitrogene; but the
Nitrogene by being attracted by
many particles has little affinity for
once hence it is seperated by hydrogen
to form ammonia.-
The Nitrous gas is not decomposable
by [insertion]Red[/insertion] heat as is the gas [unclear][insertion]x[/insertion][/unclear] oxyd into
Nitrous acid & common air -
but at high heat into Nitrous
acid & Nitrogene: hence it appears
that the mass of the attractions
of Nitrogene are less in Nitrous
gas.

Quere in that expt in which gaseous oxide

is it not probable that the substance

experiments by which the changes

[deletion]if[/deletion] new facts demonstrated & the
rationale of these facts explained. -
On the absorbtion of Nitrous gas
by Water. -
In his ingenious paper on Eudiometry
Humbold has asserted, that [deletion]when[/deletion]

[page]98|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00098|dnp20a098pp|70523627[/page]
Nitrous gas [deletion]is absorbed by water, a[/deletion]

& that [deletion]when a[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] small quantity of it
[deletion]of it[/deletion] [insertion]which[/insertion] disappears when [insertion]it is[/insertion] brought in
contact with [deletion]water[/deletion] [insertion]that fluid[/insertion] [deletion]it[/deletion] is owing
to the formation of Nitrate of
Ammonia, resulting from the combination
of the oxygene of water with [deletion]a certain[/deletion]
[deletion]portion of[/deletion] the oxygene & a certain
portion of the Nitrogene of the Nitrous
gas to form Nitrous acid: & of
its hydrogene with another portion
of the Nitrogene to form Ammonia. -
This opinion He grounds upon exp[superscript]t[/superscript].
& affirms that both He & [unclear]Tassaert[/unclear]
detected by accurate tests the presence
of those two substances. -
I must own that the [deletion]difficulty[/deletion] minute
quantities of Nitrous gas absorbable
by water; & its limit of Absorbtion
[deletion]made me sceptical with regard[/deletion]

[deletion]to this fact & It was necessary for me[/deletion]
[deletion]to[/deletion] & the perfect isolation of the 99
phaenomenon made me sceptical
with regard to it - To remove
this scepticism, I distilled six ounces
of water that had been long in
ebullition; & condensed it under a
cylinder filled with mercury, [deletion]it[/deletion]
[deletion]could consequently contain no ascertainable[/deletion]
[deletion]quantity of air[/deletion] suffering a considerable
quantity of steam to pass thro
the mercury before any was condensed
for use, that no air might
remain in the retort. - [deletion][unclear]to[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]over[/insertion] this
water 1/10 of a cubic inch of

after much agitation & consequent
rest for hours [unclear]&[/unclear] remained.

time, [space left for insertion] was collected; now
accounting for the expansion from
increase of temperature this is nearly
the quantity employed. - on introducing
1/20 of oxygene nearly pure an absorbtion
almost compleat took place - From
this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it appears that Nitrous gas
[deletion]is not decompos[/deletion] forms no new combination
with water; for had Nitrate of
Ammonia been formed, a quantity of
Nitrous gas [deletion]suf[/deletion] = to that first
introduced could not have been
[deletion]formed[/deletion] in any way produced that
is existed is evident from the saturation
of the oxygene. - I was curious
to see if Nitrate of Ammonia
hindered the absorbtion of Nitrous gas
by water for this purpose [deletion]I boiled[/deletion]
I exposed Nitrous gas to a solution
of it which had been in ebullition

[page]101|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00101|dnp20a101pp|70523632[/page]

it was absorbed nearly to the same
extent as by pure water. -
I did not try Humbolts experiment
of [deletion]saturating[/deletion] [insertion]adding lime to the[/insertion] the solution. heating it
& ascertaining whether it whitened
Muriatic fumes. - Experience has c
convinced me that if such a quantity

Nitrate of Ammonia with water
& [deletion]suspended[/deletion] dissolved in such a

the [unclear]dephlogistication [/unclear] of Nitrous acid by

[page]117|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00117|dnp20a117pp|70523654[/page]
117
It would be reasonable to conclude a priori that
when simple substances enter into chemical
union the attraction of the compound would
bear some relation to the affinities of
the constituents & if we apply this reasoning
to bodies as far as we are acquainted
With their component parts we shall
find it justified by the facts - Thus
in the combinations of the [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] compound
acids with [insertion]Ammonia &[/insertion] the metallic oxides. we are
justified in concluding that the attraction
of the two combustible bases for each
other & their [deletion]seperate[/deletion] [insertion]reciprocal[/insertion] attraction [deletion]of the[/deletion]
[deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] for each other is the cause
of chemical combination - For instance
Sulphuric acid has a strong attraction
for Ammoniac; But the principles of Sulphuric
acid are sulphur & oxygene whilst the
principles of Ammoniac are Nitrogene &
Hydrogene: but Hydrogene has a strong

[page]118|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00118|dnp20a118pp|70523655[/page]
attraction for sulphur & for oxygene
& Nitrogene has a strong attraction
for oxygene. -
May we not suppose then that
the[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] compound affinit[deletion]ies[/deletion]y [deletion]are[/deletion] results
from the sum of the simple affinities
& that [deletion]oxygen[/deletion] Nitrous acid combines -
with ammoniac because the oxygene
of the [deletion]Nitrous[/deletion] [insertion]Sulphuric[/insertion] acid is attracted by
the hydrogene; & [insertion]the[/insertion] sulphur by that
simple bodies cannot combine with two principles
at a time results from the strong affinity -
between two of them
When two bodies attract each other & are
attracted in different ratios by a third
No triple union can be formed provided
the point of saturation can be obtained
by one of these bodies; for these bodies still
exert their affinities on each other but these
affinities do not coalesce one of these is
much greater than the other - & in this
case ' a minute quantity only of the body

[page]119|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00119|dnp20a119pp|70523656[/page]
will combine. - 119
Thus Nitrous gas is feeble attrac
water & Nitrous acid is strong
by water, whilst Nitrous gas is strong
attracted by Nitrous acid. -
So Nitrous gas is dispelled from Nitrous
acid by the superior attraction of water
for Nitric acid but still more
is combined than water alone can hold
in solution. -
Phosphorus does not decompose sulphuric acid because
it had a stronger affinity for sulphur. -
Sulphur & phosphorus do not decompose
the metallic oxides because, they have
a strong affinity for the metallic base. -
& both of these affinities must be excesised
at the same time. -
Charcoal decomposes most of the oxides &
acids because it has little affinity for
any of them & likewise hydrogene. -
which has a [deletion]f[/deletion] very feeble affinity - -
[chemical]chemical_008|Iron[/chemical] decomposes water which sulphur & phosphorus do
not because they have affinity for hydrogene. -

[page]120|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00120|dnp20a120pp|70523658[/page]
inciples combine, their simple attractions
destroyed but only modified by their
state of existence. -
The truth of this principle appears to me
to be proved by all the phaenomena
of single affinity. -
2. No two compound bodies can combine
unless their simple principles have affinity
for each other. -
3. That the attractions which produce
the combinations of compound substances
are attractions of simple principles for
each other. -

The knowledge of the laws of corpuscular
change will depend upon the discovery
of the ration between the diminution
of the attraction of the particles of
simple substances for each other [insertion]on change of temperature[/insertion] & for
those of other bodies & increase of temperature
& the the modifications of attractions
by new combinations. -
To discover this ratio it is necessary
to reason on the [insertion]more complex[/insertion] changes particularly
where those changes become eminently
different at different temperatures. -
The man who wishes to discover
truth must form an infinite
number of false hypotheses. -

[page]176|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00176|dnp20a178pp|70523726[/page]
As far as we are acquainted with
corpuscular changes, they appear to depend
on two principles Attraction; & expansion. -
or seperation of particles. -
Waving any discussion concerning the
nature of these principles which has
no connection with true philosophy. -
It is evident that we have no power
of altering the attractions of simple
principles whilst the power of giving
them repulsion on the contrary
is in a great measure in our hands. -
By giving this repulsion we in all
cases diminish the attractions of
homogeneal particles for each other. -
whilst in many cases we are [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] capable
of increasing the attraction of heterogeneal
particles; so that our power of forming
combinations depends upon our power

the laws by which this property is governed. -
[Horizontal rule]
When two principles enter into chemical union
it is reasonable to suppose that their
compound attraction for other substances
will be modified by their attraction
for each other. - & this way principles
which have no attraction for each other
may be made to combine by the
intervention of a third principle. -
1. Attractions are not so modified by combination
but that the simple attractions still exist -
2[superscript]dly[/superscript] That those attractions diminish
[insertion]or increase as before[/insertion] with increase of temperature; - without a
new composition taking place. -
In this way the phaenomena of
the first decomposition of Nitrate of
Ammoniac must be explained all
chemical affinity must be solved by
attraction of simple principles. -

Words are more difficultly remembered

it contains some other principle -
In the new nomenclature, the simple
substances to which new names
have been given instead of being
characterised by obvious properties; have
been named with refference to
properties the knowledge of which
requires a long series of examinations!
It is not by the acidifying power
of oxygene that the experimentalist
detects its existence, it is by
its non absorbability by water

The practice adopted by the french Nomenclators

appears to me compleatly erroneous.
Let us only examine the name oxygene
or Generator of acids . A person unacquainted
with this substance, must to understand
what it is go thro' a series of
chemical facts to un[insertion]der[/insertion]stand ; but it
likewise prepossesses him with an
idea that He must afterwards correct
namely that all acids contain
more or less or it : whereas the
obvious properties by which it
is distinguished by the experimentalist
is its capability of supporting
combustion & its nonabsorbability

But were we ever to employ this [insertion]mode[/insertion]

would result from it our
names must necessarily be
compound. - & supposing that
compound substances should be
charactised by names expressing
the combination, this mode
would lead to a confusion
of Languge great as that
which took place at Babel. -
Polysyllabic names are not only
difficult to remember; but the
act of recalling them very often
produces perplexity & sometimes
loose analogies by calling up
similar sounds. . - Hence if

[page]218|MS-DAVY-12001-000-00218|dnp20a220pp|70523777[/page]
If then the names of substances are to
be formed from their properties, they
should be from properties which are
readily perceived & which have no
relation to a number of facts.
The weight of bodies compared with
some [insertion]other[/insertion] simple property would be
always sufficient, to characterise
them indeed the greater number
of simple substances may be characterised
by very simple & obvious properties. -
We do not distinguish oxygene gas

But this supposition instead of inducing
us to form crude & hasty theories

If then the united particles are incapable of as great

Philosophy imperfect & inaccurate

absurdity the necessary consequence of
the absolute divisibility of matter. In that
case no homogeneal particles could exist
& consequently no simple substances -
Attraction must necessarily be as the

Repulsive motion in the inverse ration
if an active property. -
If repulsive motion is in the inverse
ratio it is possible to determine it
by experiment. - Bodies affect our senses
by communicating motion in proportion

On our earth we find bodies [deletion]of[/deletion] affecting
our senses with different actions
we find some that in the same
space impart to us much greater
sense of repulsion than others. -
Chemistry not generally understood -
It is the doctrine of corpuscular motion
Laws of Matter are simple - only
one unknown cause of an effect
Attraction this is an active power

the effect of a peculiar motory impulse

These then are the foundations of
our reasoning. - All changes taking
place in our sensations we conceive
to be accompanied with corresponding
changes in the beings occasioning these
sensations. -
Changes are uniformly & continually
taking place in the external world
Change implies motion - We find
certain motions of bodies produced in
the same manner, we conclude that
these motions follow one common Law
or Laws. -
We find bodies tend to come in
contact with each other uniformly
& constantly - We find that these
bodies are not capable of coming
in actual contact. We find bodies

Hartleys Theory is inadequate to account

power of associating ideas together in
the order in which their causative
sensations were received. Science depends
on our connecting together a number of
ideas with some ideas or terms capable
of recalling them all ie on our

Generalisation is the associating of ideas
