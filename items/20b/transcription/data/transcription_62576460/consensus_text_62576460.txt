I examined Anthoxanthemum or vernal
meadow grass. Holcus mollis & 2 others
appeared to contain more [deletion]epiderm[/deletion]
fluid in the epidermis than
the canes - & a much larger
quantity of potash -
The silex in all these vegetables
as in the canes appears to be contained
in the epidermis or in the second
[unclear]bark[/unclear] - When the plants are
carefully burnt the [deletion]external[/deletion] figure
of the epidermis is preserved -
In the cane it has a white &
glossy appearance & is semi transparent
when well burnt in the reed
& grasses. it is white & opaque
& when viewed through a magnifier
appears to consist of ribs of flint
joined together by [unclear]xxx[/unclear] work in small particles
[Ink sketch possibly of the view of the cane through the magnifier]
