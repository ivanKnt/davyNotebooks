The perfection of the chemistry of inanimate Nature
will depend not more on the exact knowledge
of all, the effects produced by the changes constantly
taking place in matter; than on an exact
classification of those changes according to some
law. or to speak more accurately it is not
enough that we perceive every possible resemblance
of our sensations & ideas which may become
their associating link; we must likewise
learn to represent this link by terms &
by discovering a similarity in links we must
generalise terms. & then discover common or
universal laws. -
By comparing the forces by which solids & fluids
are seperated into parts we may be enabled
to form some judgment respecting their
cohesive attraction or that power by which
their particles are preserved in a state
of contiguity the comparison of this force
with [insertion]the[/insertion] expansive power of bodies by increase
of their repulsive motion, or the diminution
of their bulk by the diminution of their
repulsive motion as abstracted by a body
