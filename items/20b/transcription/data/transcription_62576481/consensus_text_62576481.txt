To determine the different quantity of
carbonic acid combinable with Ammonia at
a higher temperature I made the following
exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. The mercury in the trough was
heated to near [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] 200[superscript]o[/superscript] & the Gases of the
same kind as were used in the last expt
were employed - 20 parts of carbonic acid
at the temperature of 120 [insertion]o[/insertion] to which the 
mercury was lowered at the time the
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was made took up nearly 56 parts
of ammoniacal gas. -
This expt
A very great source of error in these
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] is the different degree of solubility
of the gases in water. Ammonia, carbonic
acid & muriatic acid dissolve different
proportions of water & are themselves
soluble in very different quantities
at a high temperature that of their
production. They carry over a considerable
quantity of water in solution which is thrown
down when they come in contact with
the cold mercury, this the water thrown down
