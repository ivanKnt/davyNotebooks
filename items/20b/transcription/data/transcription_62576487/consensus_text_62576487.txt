The following expts on the [deletion]salts[/deletion] ammoniacal
salts were not entered into with the express
design of investigating their Natures & properties
The [deletion]preparation of the[/deletion] [unclear]Mo[/unclear][superscript]n[/superscript] of the nature
& properties of [deletion]the Nitrate of Am[/deletion] NPO.
& the circumstances of the production obliged
me to pay particular attention to the
Nitrate of Ammonia: & to the carbonate
of Ammonia in the preparation of this
salt some uncommon & unnoticed properties
induced me to make the following expts
& a desire to discover if the other ammoniacal
salts followed the same laws carried
me on.
In decomposing Carbonate of Ammonia
by NPA for the purpose of making
Nitrate of Ammonia. I found that
after the [deletion]sal[/deletion] Ammonia & Nitrous
acid were perfectly neutralized so that
no effervescence was produced when
Carb[superscript]e[/superscript] of Ammonia, or nitrous acid
were formed in if exposed to heat
