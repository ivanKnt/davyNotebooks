dies, these are that a perpetual
supply of arterial blood is essential

whyle different from other venous
blood - light & oxygen perpetually
expended in animal action, the
contraction of muscular fibre may
be produced by a new arrangment
of its principles, of the restoration of its
irritability by the venous blood
accurate analyses of the differences
of the arterial & venous blood
promises to explain much of the function
of life - the differences of principles
in these two would explain was
principles were expended in animal
action - Light probably is the
principle which is perpetually combining
with the nerves & which is converted
into electric fluid by combining with
some unknown principle.
