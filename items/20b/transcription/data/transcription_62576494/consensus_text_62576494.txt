was the following, that at a high
temperature the [deletion]carbon[/deletion] N of Ammonia
acts the part of an acid & disloges
the carbonic acid from the carbonate
of Ammonia - I found that when
the effervescence had ceased the salt
which in this way is rarely obtained
in regular chrystals, had a more
alkaline taste & that it rendered
green vegetables blues. - The Heated
solutions of N of Ammonia, &c had
all the property of disloging the
Carbonic acid from the carbonate
of Ammonia, Hence I at first
suspected that the attractions of the
acids for Ammonia were increased
by increase of temperature, In attempting
to ascertain the increase of weight
of the phosnitrate of Ammonia - I was
surprised by finding a diminution of
weight instead of an increase these &
some other circumstances induced me
to suppose that the carbonic acid was
