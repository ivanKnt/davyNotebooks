The Salts with bases of Ammonia are among
the most compound substances which Chemistry
is capable of creating. In their formation
& existence a number of attractions are
concerned. The investigation of the forces
of those attractions would be the first
step towards the Knowledge of the Laws
of complex affinity, a branch of philosophy
as yet but little understood.
The analysts of the Neutral salts Bergman
Kirwan & A have disagreed in their
general results In the combinations
of Ammonia with the acids their
differences have been extremely great, which
we shall find no reason to wonder at
when we consider that they paid no
attention to the differences of temperature
