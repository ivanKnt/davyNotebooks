page 113. says the attraction of acids
to the volatile alkali is very much weakened
 by the application of a certain quantity
of heat, if the acid is of a fixed or almost
fixed Nature this uniting power over the
attraction is almost entirely destroyed. Hence
on the application of such a due degree
of heat the volatile Alkali is disengaged
from phos[superscript]c[/superscript] Arsenic: & vitriolic cal:Am
This volatile Alkali then assumes an
aerial form: & retains this form as long
as it does not come in contact with
water; but if it meets with water it
unites therewith, loses its elasticity & lets go
as much heat as was necessary for imparting
to it its uniform quality, Here then we
have the caustic spirit of Sal Ammoniac
