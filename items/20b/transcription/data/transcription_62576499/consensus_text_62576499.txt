We know that steam [deletion]&[/deletion] absorbs heat
& that when a portion of heat is abstracted
water is produced; but this water still
contains a considerable quantity of heat
in a latent state - The same thing
happens in the case of the caustic
spirit of Sal ammonia it still retains
heat - Fourcroy in his traite elementaire
has mentioned the fact relating to
the Sulphate of Ammonia as
discovered by B. - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatcheet in
his analysis of the M of lead has
related some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the decomposition
of the Sulphate of Ammonia by
heat. He states the products of
this decomposition to be Nitrogen
Ammonia & sulphureous acid &
from some reasons concludes
that the muriatic acid is
partially seperable from its Base
by Heat & that many of the neutral
salts will be found to be alterable
