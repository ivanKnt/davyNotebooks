I first endeavored to analise the common carbonate
of Ammonia in such a way as guard against
the liberation of its carbonic acid with other
products of the carbonate of Ammonia of
commerce there are two varieties which generally
exist together, the outside of the one is white
Carbonate of Ammonia of Commerce
This salt when it has been kept close
is in solid semitransparent masses,
it presents no regular chrystalisation
its smell is [deletion]alkaline[/deletion] like that of
caustic Ammonia it turns Vegetable
Hues green its taste is pungent &
alkaline - this was the middle part
the outside is always carbonate
100 grains of this salt [deletion]were inserted[/deletion]
in a higher degree.
[deletion]into a matrass[/deletion] were decomposed
by 200 grains of sulphuric acid of
the specific gravity of 1,741 , the loss
of weight amounted to 47 grains -
A considerable degree of heat was produced
during the process which produced
an evaporation of some carbonate
