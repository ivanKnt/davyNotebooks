of Ammonia & sulphuric acid undecomposed
To ascertain the deficiency of weight
from this loss 100 grains were
decomposed by 200 grains of Sulphuric
acid diluted with 500 grains of
water. there was no sensible
heat produced during this process
the loss of weight was [deletion]4[/deletion] 16,8/4
200 grains of acid were now
diluted with 1000 grains of water
in the decomposition of 100
grains of carbonate of Ammonia
by this the loss of weight was 46
When the salt was gently heated
small globules of air were disengaged
from whence it appears that
Carbonic acid was held in
solution - from these different
