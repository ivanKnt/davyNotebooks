800 grains of Carbonate of Ammonia
were mingled with 400 grains of

which they were inserted was accurately
weighed & a pneumatic app[superscript]s[/superscript] applied

with C. mercurial airholder
on the application of a low heat
gas began to be disengaged -
I feared lest this gas should be
carbonic acid, as I had before
found that dry lime was incapable
of decomposing the dry carbonate of
Ammonia, on increasing the heat
a diminution of the gas already formed
