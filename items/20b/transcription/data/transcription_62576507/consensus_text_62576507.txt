This salt is [deletion]not[/deletion] capable of giving out
& of combining with carbonic acid
I had found in two or three instances
[deletion]that at the heat[/deletion]
Absorbtion of carbonic acid
by the Carbonate of Ammonia
The alkaline Carbonate of ammonia
is capable of combining with a
larger quantity of carbonic acid.
20 grains were inserted into a cylinder
filled with mercury, 3 cubic
inches of carbonic acid were admitted
this gas was absorbed pretty rapidly
at first but more slowly afterwards
in an hour & half there
was a diminution of 2 3/4 of
a cubic inch, the carbonate
of Ammonia was very little altered
it was impossible to determine
its increase of temperature.
