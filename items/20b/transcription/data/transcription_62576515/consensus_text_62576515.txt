NB in these analysis, there are
the following circumstances to be considered
1. the bulk of the gas at a given temperature
which being given its weight is also given
2. the difference between the weight
of the gas & the weight lost by the
carbonate of Ammonia & lime
this difference is water saturated
with ammonia, which water being
dissolved by the ammonia at a high
temperature is thrown down [deletion]again[/deletion]
when thrown down it dissolves
ammonia, to know the quantity
of ammonia & water in this we
may make use of the following
formula. it was first essential
to determine, the quantity of ammonia
condensed by a known quality of
distilled water & its diminuation
of density the specific gravity of
compleatly caustic spirit of ammonia
is
