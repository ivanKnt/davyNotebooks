From these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] it is evident that
there exist many varieties of carbonate
of Ammonia, the common carbonate
of Ammonia of commerce is not
saturated with Carbonic acid &
is even capable of combining with
a larger quantity of ammonia,
To ascertain whether slight differences
of temperature would produce any
differences in the quantities of carbonic
acid & Ammonia entering into combination
the following exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were made
1500 grain measures of Ammonia
obtained from the decomposition
of Sulphate of Ammonia by Lime
which had been passed thro Carbonate
of potash to deprive it of its moisture
was mingled with 500 grains of carbonic
is mingled with 500 grains of carbonic
acid under mercury - A diminution
took place & about 320 grains measures
remained - this proved to be pure
Ammonia temperature in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was 63
Barometer 30,6
