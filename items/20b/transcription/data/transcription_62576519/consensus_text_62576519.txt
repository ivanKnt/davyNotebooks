free your mercury perfectly from water.
The mercury was generally carefully
cleaned before it was used &
heated to evaporate the moisture.
With great difficulty, I mingled
together 4 [insertion]of[/insertion] Ammonia with 4 of carbonic
acid, the mercury being at the
temperature of 180. a contraction
of about 2 took place but no
white clouds were formed, when
the gas was removed from the
heated mercury into cold, a
diminution rapidly took place
& white clouds were formed, when
the condensation was compleat, there
remained about 2 1/2 of carbonic
acid, from hence it appears that
carbonic acid & Ammonia combine
at high temperature & still retain
the aeriform state. -
