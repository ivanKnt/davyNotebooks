We have already mentioned 2 distinct
varieties of carbonate of Ammonia
one of which is partially saturated
with [deletion]ammonia[/deletion] carbonic acid the
other of which is perfectly neutralised
there exists a third variety
which is perfectly distinct from
either of those & which is produced
when carbonic acid is driven off
from Carbonate of Ammonia.

50 grains of carbonate of Ammonia
which contained 46 P[superscript]r[/superscript] cent carbonic
acid [deletion]3[/deletion] 41 Ammonia & 13 water
of chrystalisation were inserted into
a [deletion]mattrass[/deletion] retort communicating with
the air holder of [unclear]Cact[superscript]s[/superscript][/unclear]. heat was
slowly applied, & gas came over, 34
cubic inches were in the cylinder, this
air was now transferred into a
Cylinder under water 26 cubic inches
