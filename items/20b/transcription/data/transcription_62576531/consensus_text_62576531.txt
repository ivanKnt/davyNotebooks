Introduction, historical facts, motives that
induced me to undertake this investigation [insertion]carbonation of diff states[/insertion]
plan of the investigation - exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] not related
in the order in which they were made
but arranged. 1st Analysis of the carbonate
of ammonia of commerce with observation
on the analysis of the carbonate of
Ammonia in general; absorbtion of [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
acid by carbonate of Ammonia alteration
of its properties, general change, that
it undergoes when exposed
 it undegoes when exposed to the atmosphere [insertion]Acid Carbonate of Ammonia[insertion] is
its aeriformication at a high temperature
gives out a portion of its carbonic acid
different quantities given out by the
acid carbonate of Ammonia & the
common formation of Alkaline
Carbonate, its analysis, its properties
compared with the other carbonates
aeriformication, all the carbonates
of Ammonia evaporated from
water - decomposition of the
Carbonates of Ammonia - / the acid
