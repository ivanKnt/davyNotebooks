The first step towards these laws will
be the decomposition of these
bodies which are at present
undecomposed. & the & probably
no class of substances will throw
greater light on this than
the Ammoniacal salts & it
is astonishing that since the
decomposition of Ammonia in
the Nitrate of Ammonia by
Berthollet no attempts should
have been made to decompose
the other Acids in these salts.
From the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that follow
it will appear that all
the Ammoniacal salts undergo
great changes by heat & that
in many of them at high
temperatures the Ammonia &
carbonic Acid mutually decompose each
