124
Immediately after a [deletion]long journey[/deletion]
[deletion]in which[/deletion] a journey of 126
six miles, & in which I had
had no sleep the preceding night
being much exhausted I took
7 quarts of [chemical_048]gas[/chemical_048]. - It produced
its usual pleasurable effects &
slight muscular motions I danced
about the room & continued
exhilarated for some minutes
afterwards, I was neither revived
or exhausted & slept remarkably
sound that [deletion]following[/deletion] night
I repeated the experiment once
or twice & found my susceptibility
as usual. -
Though no exhaustion had followed
