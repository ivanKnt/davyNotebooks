my pulse & animal heat -
the first sensation was a glow
in the cheeks generally diffused
warmth. - tho' the temperature
of the box could not I should
think have been more than

my pulse before I went in
3 or four minutes after it
was 104 & full. - the animal
heat was 108. -
In 10 minutes the animal
heat was near 99. in
a quarter of an hour 99.5.
& the pulse 102 fuller than

20 quarts more were now thrown
in. -
