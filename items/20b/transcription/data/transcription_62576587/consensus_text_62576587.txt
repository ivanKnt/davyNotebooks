[deletion]& I was let out the moment[/deletion]
After an hour & quarter
that I came out. I got 20
quarts of air. which was to
have been thrown into the
box: The sensations were superior
to any I ever experienced. -
inconceivably pleasurable
ideas were more vivid & associated
together much more rapidly &
so associated with words as to
produce perceptions perfectly novel.
Theories passed rapidly thro the
mind beleived I may say intensely. -
at the same time that every
thing going on in the room
was perceived, I seemed to
be a sublime being, newly
created & superior to other mortals
