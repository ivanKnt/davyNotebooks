the different quantities of light given
out in combustion, Charcoal
less than iron, iron less than
Sulphur sulphur less than phosphorus
No proofs; of the production of
electricity in slow combustive processes -
what then becomes of the light
no proofs of the production
of electric fluid in vacuo
by the condensation of light
[deletion]Theory[/deletion] red precipitate & sulphur
produce no light in conversion
Nitre & sulphur do. no light
produced during the decomposition
of Nitrate & Ammonia & [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
mur: of potash. - no signs of electricity
& no light; oxygen decomposed rapidly
by heated sulfures without any liberation
X of light , much more rapidly than by
phosphorus - same theory will apply
to the supposition that the combustible
bodies contain light. -
