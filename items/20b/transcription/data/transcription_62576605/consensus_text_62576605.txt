March. 23.
I breathed six quarts of fine
[deletion]gaseous ox[/deletion] Nitrous oxide not having taken
any before for some time
the sensations were most delightful
my ideas were uncommonly vivid
no sensations existed to disturb me
& I seemed a new being -
24.
I breathed the same quantity
of the same air in a short
time a fulness of the head was
induced; my visibility to sound
was painfully increased, my
teeth were pained, & I did
not feel the usual pleasurable
thrilling, I certainly could not
call any of the sensations pleasurable
this exp[superscript]t[superscript] was just after a
walk the other was before - Mem
Nitrous gas - a little pain
