I have endeavoured in this detail to
give [insertion][deletion]as[/deletion][/insertion] an account [insertion]as accurate as possible[/insertion] of the [insertion]strange[/insertion] effects of
[deletion]the[/deletion] Nitrous oxide by making use of
terms standing for
most analogous common feelings [insertion][deletion]the most known feelings[/deletion][/insertion] it is
however from the nature of the language of feeling
full of imperfections
By those who have not experimented
upon the gas much will be attributed
to imagination. All that I can hope
for is to interest individuals
[deletion]sufficiently[/deletion] sufficiently [insertion]in the subject[/insertion] to induce
them to examine for themselves. -
For it is impossible to communicate
by means of [deletion]language[/deletion] [insertion]words[insertion] any [insertion]accurate[/insertion] notion
of [insertion]new[/insertion] pleasurable emotions. -
It is indeed impossible to reason
concerning [deletion]ple[/deletion] [insertion]common[/insertion] physical pleasures &
pains, except by means of terms
which have been connected with
them at the moment of their
existence & which are afterwards
recalled amid other associated ideas -
