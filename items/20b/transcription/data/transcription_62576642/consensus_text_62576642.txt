No one will deny the existence of
motion no one will deny that
expansion is the only measure of heat
The expansion if you allow the
existence of particles they must
move or separate from each other
The phenomenon of the condensation of
fluids & gases producing what
is called increased temperature
is another fact unconnected
with expansion & requires to
be differently reasoned upon.
I was perhaps wrong in publishing
with such haste a new Theory of
Chemistry & my mind was ardent
& enthusiastic. I believed I had
discovered the truth, since that
time my knowledge of facts is
increased, since that time I
have become more sceptical
