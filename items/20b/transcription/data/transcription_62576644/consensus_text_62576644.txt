These critics perhaps do not understand
that these experiments were made at a
time when I had studied Chemistry
but four months, when I had never
seen a single experiment executed
+ & when all my chemical information
was derived from Nicholson's Chemistry
& Lavoisiers elements. They do not
perhaps consider that my apparatus
could not be made more perfect
& that infinite labour was required
in performing every exp[superscript]t[/superscript] they have
asserted that their inaccuracies have
been determined by some eminent
chemists, who are these eminent
chemists there are few enough
God knows in England. They were
often repeated & they will in
general be found to be accurate
 In a system, much criticism I despise
