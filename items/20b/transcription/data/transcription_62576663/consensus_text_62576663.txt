July 13. The blood which was exposed yesterday
is of a dark crimson - & an absorbtion
of 1 & 1/3 has taken place, the remaining
gas will not support the flame of a
taper as well as before -
both the plants took very well & in
both a slight abrabtion has taken place
this morning a porcelain tube was heated
red & muriate of Ammonia inserted into
that end which was cool, gas slowly
came over & about 12 cubic inches
were collected which appeared to
be a mixture of Hydrogen, oxygen & Nitrogen
Miss. T. breathed this morning six
quarts of gaseous oxyd, then began to breath
without any apprehension & breathed remarkably
well took full inspirations, in about a
minute she suffered the bag to drop
She then began to sob most violently
then cryed & laughed alternately she
used most vivid muscular actions &
appeared to be perfectly delerious in about
ten minutes this went of altogether
