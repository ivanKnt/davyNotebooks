was now admitted which was soon
clouded at the top & a little at the
bottom by the phosphoric acid formed
a diminution of about 1/7 was perceived
from whence it appears that this

the oxygen remaining was absorbed by
a superabundance of Nitrous gas , after this
was absorbed by Sulphate of Iron the
remaining gas was 4 1/3 - 2 1/3. Hence it appears
that the Inflammable gases formed only
