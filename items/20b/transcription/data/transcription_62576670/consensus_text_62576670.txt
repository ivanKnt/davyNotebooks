The experiments which I have before
mentioned in which, an infammatable
air Nitrogen & Carbonic acid were produced
by passing the carbonate of Ammonia
thro heated tubes induced me to suppose
that at this temperature the Hydrogen
of the Ammonia was capable of decomposing
the carbonic acid by its attraction
for oxygen, I endeavored to ascertain
this in the following manner -
50 grains of the Alkaline Carbonate
of ammonia were decomposed by diluted
sulphuric acid & gave 23 grains Carbonic
acid - which is = to X cubic inches
50 grains were inserted into a retort
communicating with a mercurial
apparatus & heat applied sufficient
to sublime the Alcarbonate of Ammonia
during the sublimation 36 cubic inches
