I can mean nothing more or less than the visible
& tangible ideas [insertion][deletion]organs[/deletion] or impressions[/insertion] generally called organs, audible
impressions cannot be so well called part of
self as they are variable & infinitely different
except those words I, self myself eye nose
&c. which are connected often with our
impressions & ideas, The sensations we call
self [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] are petually [insertion][unclear]rpetualy[/unclear][/insertion] occuring & are more or
or less connected with all our other trains
of ideas & sensations, the greater number of our
pleasures & pains are connected with these ideas
tangible & visible which we call self'.
from this analysis we find the absurdity
of what has been called conciousness of
existence, of Descartes axiom. I think therefore
I exist. Of Hartleys beginning. of Darwins
beginning &c
