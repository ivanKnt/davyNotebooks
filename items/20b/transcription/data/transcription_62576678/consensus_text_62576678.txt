[deletion][unclear]Morality or the xxxxxxx which teaches[/unclear][/deletion]
The power of regulating our actions must
be deduced from experience - those actions
are in fact the result of our [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] own ideas
our passions & present sensations.
Morality is a science which teaches us
rightly to associate pleasure & pain with
our ideas - we find almost perpetualy
in metaphysical books allusions to mind
as the being in which sensations ideas
&c exist, they ought first to have
defined the word mind is it an idea
or a pleasure or pain or a sensation
I do not find that it is either of
these it must then be a word
expressing either all our sensations ideas
pleasures & pains or some of them
We will just consider what is the
true meaning of the word self. -
