discoveries in the physical Sciences instead
of showing to the [unclear]Gr.[/unclear] new paths for the
pursuit of experimental science have
heretofore been more the subject of speculation
The cure of diseases by the application of air
to the lungs is altogether founded on
the modern discoveries in Chemistry. -
The importance of respiration to life
& of an atmosphere of a peculiar constitution
to Health. are facts which have never
escaped the observation of Mankind in

in the system by respiration in spite of
the light thrown upon them by Chemistry are not
so well understood - Very simple experiments
prove that the bodies called combustible are
only capable of inflammation when in contact
with air of a peculiar kind which from
its property of supporting life has been called
Vital air. in the process of combustion
the combustible body & the vital air
disappear, with great Heat & the liberation

substances forming it -
