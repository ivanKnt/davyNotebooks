         <p>A Scottish scientific instrument maker who studied with the chemist Joseph Black at
            Glasgow University. He developed the separate condenser for steam engines which increased
            their effieciency significantly. He took out a twenty-five-year patent (ending in
            1800) and moved to Birmingham where he went into partnership with the businessman
            and industrialist Matthew Boulton. They made their fortune by having an effective
            monopoly of manufacturing steam engines. A friend of Thomas Beddoes, he met Davy on
            a number of occasions and Davy gave the oration at the unveiling of Watt's statue
            in Greenock. FRSL.</p>
