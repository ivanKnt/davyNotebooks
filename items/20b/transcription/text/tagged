[blockdeletion]A few days since [person]person_479|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Coates[/person] of Clifton requested me

A few days ago [person]person_479|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Coates[/person] of Clifton informed
me that his son accidentally rubbing two
pieces of [misc]misc_267|bonnet cane[/misc] together in the dark
had perceived a luminous appearance -
This [insertion]unknown[/insertion] phaenomenon was sufficiently curious
to induce me to examine it - I found that
all Canes of this kind . A. [unclear]N[/unclear]. when rubbed
briskly together produced vivid sparks of Light-
The luminous appearance was much more vivid
in collision. When the canes were violently
struck together sparks nearly as brilliant
as those from the gunlock were produced.
while at the same time a strong
smell similar [deletion]D2.[/deletion] that perceived during

I at first thought it probable that
the phaenomenon was electric & depended
upon some resinous matter in the cane

The electrometer however was not sensibly
affected, [deletion][unclear]when[/unclear]the[/deletion] during the experiment
To determine whether the effect depended on
some substance in the whole of the cane
or in the epidermis alone, I removed
the latter - when the canes deprived of
the external bark were struck together
no luminous appearanc was perceived -

I now examined the epidermis, [deletion]it had not[/deletion] when

something the appearance of powdered glass:
I now no [deletion]longer[/deletion] doubted [insertion]but[/insertion] that the luminous
It now occurred to me that this epidermis
[deletion]appearance[/deletion] was produced by [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical]
composing the epidermis - I found that
the luminous appearance was produced when
the cane was struck against a [chemical]chemical_122|silicious[/chemical] 
stone, or against sharp [chemical]chemical_397|shale[/chemical]; but
not [deletion]against[/deletion] by other substances.

the same quantity as in the last experiment

25 grains .- [deletion]The[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] boiled upon

I first examined the [chemical]chemical_343|Avena P.[/chemical] or

common Water reed. 26 grains of the
epidermis of this gave 13 grains of white
earthy matter insoluble in the mineral

I examined Anthoxanthemum or vernal
meadow grass. Holcus mollis & 2 others
appeared to contain more [deletion]epiderm[/deletion]
[chemical]chemical_106|Flint[/chemical] in the epidermis than
the canes - & a much larger
quantity of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] -
The [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] in all these vegetables
as in the canes appears to be contained
in the epidermis or in the second
bark - When the plants are
carefully burnt the [deletion]external[/deletion] figure
of the epidermis is preserved -
In the cane it has a white &
glossy appearance & is semi transparent

The bamboo has likewise an epidermis
[insertion]but not near so thick as that in the [misc]misc_267|bonnet canes[/misc][/insertion]
of [chemical]chemical_034|Silex[/chemical] - The sugar cane Canna
indica contains but a very small
proportion, its residual ashes are chiefly
calcareous - The quantity of
[chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] in the grasses induced me
to suppose that in a strong heat
they might be fused into Glass -
In the reed the quantity was
not sufficient; it remained unaltered
in the strongest Heat I could
give it. The ashes of straw urged
by a strong Heat gave a white
transparent glass - perfectly insoluble
they gave a black glass with

Our Ignorance of the functions of life, the consequent
uncertainty of the medical art & the delusion
too often practised by its professors necessarily
dispose thinking men to doubt of the efficacy
of every new mode of practice till it has been
established by the test of experiment & erected
on the basis of time: - To this scepticism they
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] will however add the desire of pursuing or
promoting every investigation which affords
the most distant hopes of benefiting Humanity
by destroying painful sensation - if all
Men were actuated by this spirit Medical
science would not have remained so long
uncertain. To attempt to prove [deletion]to mankind[/deletion]
the imperfection of the medical art would be
an insult on the common sense of mankind
Not many of those painful diseases which
first render Death desirable & then produce

continually falling the victims of a lingering &

to fear, the Daemon of incurable disease
No [insertion]any[/insertion] individual is uninterested in the [deletion]progress[/deletion] [insertion]improvement[/insertion] 
of Medical Science. That Medical Science
is capable of improvement is a truth that
no one can doubt. To prove it we need but
cast our eyes on the History of medicine
[deletion]Many dis[/deletion] some diseases formerly incurable now
yeild to the power of medicine, Many maladies
which formerly depopulated Nations are now
almost exterminated. What has been done proves
to Mankind that they are capable of doing
The physical Sciences, in their gradual approximation
towards man are every day unfolding more
of his nature. Chemistry has opened to us
a new field for the improvement of medical
science. The knowledge of some of the functions
of Life & particularly of Respiration long ago le[deletion]a[/deletion]d
many philosophers to suppose that diseases might
be cured by the application of airs to the
lungs, by producing chemical changes or
altering the atmosphere. - To the investigation
of this opinion in private practice a
number of difficulties almost insurmountable
presented themselves.

[page]15|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00015|dnp20b013pp|62576465[/page]
13
few private individuals were capable of procuring
an app[superscript]s[/superscript] perfectly adequate to this important
purpose. besides the passions & prejudices of
Mankind opposed themselves to this mode
of pursuing the investigation. One class
of Medical professors attached to the present
[deletion]mode of[/deletion] practice from self interest or [deletion]the[/deletion]
ambition one might naturally suppose would
oppose in every possible way every attempt at
innovation. Another class fond of novelty in the
warmth of their imagination have supposed that
Pneumatic medicine born all perfect was to supercede
every other mode of practice & to give to Man
almost immortality - A third Class, by far the
most dangerous have made it the instrument
of quackery have made use of it to deceive
Mankind & to fill their own pockets.
To do away these difficulties, to investigate
fairly Pneumatic Medicine [place]place_645|This Institution[/place]
was originally proposed by [person]person_029|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes[/person]. It
has been supported, it has been supported
by the liberal and enlighted physicians of
[place]place_121|England[/place] & by the greater number of those
Philosophers who have the true interest
of their species at heart. -
From their support it has been
established. The present subscription is adequate

that it will be increased & made adequate
to the perfect completion of the design -
[deletion]By calling the attention of medical & philosophical[/deletion]
[deletion]Men to the great object of [place]place_645|the institution[/place][/deletion]
[deletion]we may hope for the invention of plans[/deletion]

The perfection of the chemistry of inanimate Nature
will depend not more on the exact knowledge
of all, the effects produced by the changes constantly
taking place in matter; than on an exact
classification of those changes according to some
law. or to speak more accurately it is not
enough that we perceive every possible resemblance
of our sensations & ideas which may become
their associating link; we must likewise
learn to represent this link by terms &
by discovering a similarity in links we must
generalise terms. & thus discover common or
universal laws. -
By comparing the forces by which solids & fluids
are seperated into parts we may be enabled
to form some judgment respecting their
cohesive attraction or that power by which
their particles are preserved in a state

with [insertion]the[/insertion] expansive power of bodies by increase
of their repulsive motion, or the diminution

To determine the different quantity of

A very great source of error in these
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] is the different degree of solubility
of the gases in water. [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], carbonic
acid & [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] dissolve different
proportions of water & are themselves
soluble in very different quantities
at a high temperature that of their

When we say I think it is most
likely such results will necessarily
take place we have certain ideas
of vision & touch connected with
terms either from analogy or successive
impression, we make use of our
motions connected with such trains

sensations which always give us
either new ideas or modify our

The philosophers who have [deletion]treated as[/deletion] written
on Man have generally began by
generalising terms by laying down certain
laws & arranging phaenomena according
to these laws. This mode of
philosophising belongs to the imaginative
faculties not to the [deletion]invention[/deletion]
reasoning powers. nothing is more easy
than to give a history of what we
know to associate by the links of
analogies all our perceptions &
ideas we do not so much want
a 'History of Man'. What meaning
can propositions like these convey
when taken for general principles of
reasoning Man is composed to 2 parts
body & mind, [deletion]when the[/deletion] body must be
purely the sensations of [deletion]we receive[/deletion] our different
organs such as those called Hand feet leg

dissolves the gas. & the ammoniacal
gas is more soluble than the carbonic
acid, & the [chemical]chemical_016|muri[superscript]c[/superscript][/chemical] than the ammoniacal
so that if very great care be not
taken these circumstances will be a source
of error.
The investigation of chemical affinity has
been heretofore cheifly confined to the consideration
of the force by which bodies simple, or
considered in their [insertion]mutual[/insertion] attraction [deletion]as[/deletion] simple
exert on each other. The attractions of
the simple substances for each other of the
acids for the alkalies & metallic oxyds
form the phaenomena of single & double
affinity - The laws by which many
principles are united into one compound
the [deletion]attractions[/deletion] combination of principles
which have no affinities under certain

little attended to. The order of the
affinities of the A for the alkalies
have been classed by B & K. -
One principle must be laid down that
every principle in combination must
exert a distinct attraction. Sulphuric
acid can exert no attraction as sulphuric
acid. its attraction must be exerted
as the attraction of [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] & of

The following expts on the [deletion]salts[/deletion] ammoniacal
salts were not entered into with the express
design of investigating their Natures & properties
The [deletion]preparation of the[/deletion] [unclear]Mo[/unclear][superscript]n[/superscript] of the nature

& the circumstances of the production obliged
me to pay particular attention to the
[chemical]chemical_094|Nitrate of Ammonia[/chemical]: & to the carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] in the preparation of this
salt some uncommon & unnoticed properties
induced me to make the following expts
& a desire to discover if the other ammoniacal
salts followed the same laws carried
me on.
In decomposing [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
by NPA for the purpose of making
[chemical]chemical_094|Nitrate of Ammonia[/chemical]. I found that
after the [deletion]sal[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] & Nitrous

We reason, or rather we ought to reason from
our sensations or ideas by means of words
We ought to use no words, that do
not express some ideas or some sensations
The great error of Men of Science in
forming systems is that they have hardly
ever made use of accurate terms -
Of the living principle, the immaterial
principle & the [unclear]xx[/unclear] of the Animation -
These are all words without meaning
Mind has hardly ever a definite
meaning given to it, of Physiology
in its strict sense. [insertion]of consciousness & I or self. we have no business with these questions, whether matter or mind exists, they neither exist[/insertion] It is - the science
which teaches us to connect all our
sensations & ideas to others which we
call organs - for example all our
sensations of sight depend on the eye
& so on, more refined physiology
goes on & investigates brain nerve &
muscular fibre. [deletion]A correspondence between[/deletion]
This is all analogical reasoning, we
cheifly learn it from examining other
beings & from their resembling us

[page]40|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00040|dnp20b038pp|62576490[/page]
38
We suppose the same connection between
our sensations & words which we call
our organs or visible ideas gained from
other beings & applied to our selves
This mode of reasoning discovers to
us that the healthy state of the system
is dependant on a certain constitution
of organ it proves to us that
a certain arrangment of the
principles of the irritable fibre is
essential to its irritability, a nerve
that was once sensible & that
ceases to become sensible must have
had some change effected in it, so
must a muscular fibre, this
change is not immediately evident
it consequently can not be mechanical
& might be chemical -
to the senses it must then either
lose some principles, gain some principles
or possess a new arrangment of its
principles reasons for supposing
that the fibre loses principles when it

supply of arterial blood is essential
to support life - Arterial blood
becomes venous difference between
the two. Venous blood saturated
whyle different from other venous
blood - light & [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical] perpetually
expended in animal action, the
contraction of muscular fibre may
be produced by a new arrangment
of its principles, of the restoration of its
irritability by the venous blood
accurate analyses of the differences
of the arterial & venous blood
promises to explain much of the function
of life - the differences of principles
in these two would explain was
principles were expended in animal
action - Light probably is the
principle which is perpetually combining
with the nerves & which is converted
into electric fluid by combining with
some unknown principle.

Of the Combinations of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
with the Acids & [chemical]chemical_138|phosacids[/chemical] -
I was not so much induced to institute the
following exp[superscript]s[/superscript] from a consideration of the
importance of investigating the complex
attractions which unite the numerous
simple principles of these substances & their
connexion with sublime Chemistry, nor from
considering the labors of others. The
Investigation of the properties of the Nitrous
phosoxyd obliged me to pay particular attention
to the composition & properties of the
phosnitrate of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] from which this
gas is obtained - I made this salt by
decomposing the [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
by N P Acid - After the saturation
was compleat at the common tem[superscript]e[/superscript] of
the Atmosphere I observed that carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] thrown into the aqueous
solution of this salt heated produced
 effervescence – [deletion]I[/deletion] the conclusion formed

[page]44|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00044|dnp20b042pp|62576494[/page]
42
was the following, that at a high
temperature the [deletion][chemical]chemical_054|Carbon[/chemical][/deletion] N of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
acts the part of an acid & disloges
the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] from the carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] - I found that when
the effervescence had ceased the salt
which in this way is rarely obtained
in regular chrystals, had a more
alkaline taste & that it rendered
green vegetables blues. - The Heated
solutions of N of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], &c had
all the property of disloging the
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] from the carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], Hence I at first
suspected that the attractions of the
acids for [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] were increased
by increase of temperature, In attempting
to ascertain the increase of weight
of the phosnitrate of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] - I was
surprised by finding a diminution of
weight instead of an increase these &
some other circumstances induced me
to suppose that the [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] was

[page]45|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00045|dnp20b043pp|62576495[/page]
43
detached from the [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] by the
heat that an alkaline carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] was formed which at
the temperature of evaporation gasified
To prove whether this was the
case [deletion]I institute[/deletion] & to clear up the

The Salts with bases of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] are among
the most compound substances which Chemistry
is capable of creating. In their formation
& existence a number of attractions are
concerned. The investigation of the forces
of those attractions would be the first
step towards the Knowledge of the Laws
of complex affinity, a branch of philosophy
as yet but little understood.
The analysts of the Neutral salts [person]person_033|Bergman[/person]
[person]person_023|Kirwan[/person] & W have disagreed in their
general results In the combinations
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] with the acids their
differences have been extremely great, which
we shall find no reason to wonder at
when we consider that they paid no
attention to the differences of temperature

page 113. says the attraction of acids
to the volatile alkali is very much weakened
 by the application of a certain quantity
of heat, if the acid is of a fixed or almost
fixed Nature this uniting power over the
attraction is almost entirely destroyed. Hence
on the application of such a due degree
of heat the volatile Alkali is disengaged
from phos[superscript]c[/superscript] [chemical]chemical_069|Arsenic[/chemical]: & vitriolic sal:Am
This volatile Alkali then assumes an
aerial form: & retains this form as long
as it does not come in contact with
water; but if it meets with water it
unites therewith, loses its elasticity & lets go
as much heat as was necessary for imparting
to it its [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] quality, Here then we
have the caustic spirit of [chemical]chemical_013|Sal Ammoniac[/chemical]

We know that steam [deletion]&[/deletion] absorbs heat
& that when a portion of heat is abstracted
water is produced; but this water still
contains a considerable quantity of heat
in a latent state - The same thing
happens in the case of the caustic
spirit of [chemical]chemical_013|Sal ammonia[/chemical] it still retains
heat - [person]person_011|Fourcroy[/person] in his [misc]misc_308|traite elementaire[/misc]

the [chemical]chemical_357|Sulphate of Ammonia[/chemical] as
discovered by B. - [person]person_149|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatcheet[/person] in
his analysis of the [chemical]chemical_219|M of lead[/chemical] has
related some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the decomposition
of the [chemical]chemical_357|Sulphate of Ammonia[/chemical] by

this decomposition to be [chemical]chemical_017|nitrogen[/chemical]
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_067|sulphureous acid[/chemical] &
from some reasons concludes
that the [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical] is
partially seperable from its Base
by Heat & that many of the neutral
salts will be found to be alterable

the [chemical]chemical_520|Sulphite of Ammonia[/chemical] like
the Sulphate gives out Ammoniacal
gas on increase of temperature
& becomes acid Sulfate-
Such are the facts as far as
my information extends which have

I first endeavored to analise the common carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] in such a way as guard against
the liberation of its [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] with other
products of the [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical] of
commerce there are two varieties which generally
exist together, the outside of the one is white
[chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical] of Commerce
This salt when it has been kept close
is in solid semitransparent masses,
it presents no regular chrystalisation
its smell is [deletion]alkaline[/deletion] like that of
caustic [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] it turns Vegetable
blues green its taste is pungent &
alkaline - this was the middle part
the outside is always carbonated
100 grains of this salt [deletion]were inserted[/deletion]
in a higher degree.
[deletion]into a matrass[/deletion] were decomposed
by 200 grains of [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] of
the specific gravity of 1,741 , the loss
of weight amounted to 47 grains -
A considerable degree of heat was produced
during the process which produced
an evaporation of some carbonate

[page]52|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00052|dnp20b050pp|62576502[/page]
50
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] undecomposed
To ascertain the deficiency of weight
from this loss 100 grains were
decomposed by 200 grains of Sulphuric
acid diluted with 500 grains of
water. there was no sensible
heat produced during this process
the loss of weight was [deletion]4[/deletion] 16,8/4
200 grains of acid were now
diluted with 1000 grains of water
in the decomposition of 100
grains of [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
by this the loss of weight was 46
When the salt was gently heated
small globules of air were disengaged
from whence it appears that
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] was held in
solution - [deletion]from[/deletion] of these different
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][deletion]it[/deletion] we must take the second

[page]53|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00053|dnp20b051pp|62576503[/page]
51
as giving the most accurate result in
this the heat produced was not
sufficient to occasion a great loss
from evaporation & the water [insertion]was insufficient to[/insertion] hold
in solution any perceptible quantity
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]. -
800 grains of [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
were mingled with 400 grains of
sla[superscript]d[/superscript] causticc [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical], the matrass into
which they were inserted was accurately
weighed & a pneumatic app[superscript]s[/superscript] applied
to it, this app[superscript]s[/superscript] communicated
with C. mercurial airholder
on the application of a low heat
gas began to be disengaged -
I feared lest this gas should be
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical], as I had before
found that dry [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] was incapable
of decomposing the dry carbonate of
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], on increasing the heat
a diminution of the gas already formed

began to take place & white
clouds were formed, gas then began
to pass over & about 46 cubic
inches were collected which were
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], the mattrass was now
weighed The loss was 56 - From
this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it is evident that
dry [chemical]chemical_091|caustic lime[/chemical] is incapable of
attracting [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] from
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], portion of it with
probably some salt flies off on the
increase of temperature & the [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
does not begin to act on the
[chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical] till it is
fused in its water of Chrystalisation.
[chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] slightly wetted was now
employed 500 parts to 100 of Carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] in this way 115 cubic
inches of gas were collected; but a
considerable quantity of water came over
& the gas was slightly clouded, the loss

[page]55|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00055|dnp20b053pp|62576505[/page]
53
of weight was 5,3. The gas carried over
a large quantity of water at this
temperature which it deposited on
cooling, this water absorbed much
of the gas, whilst a part of the
salt probably rose and undecomposed
so that this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was perfectly
undecisive. -
500 grains were now mingled with
200 grains of [chemical]chemical_180|slacked lime[/chemical] slightly wetted
over this was inserted a quantity of caustic
[chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] which [deletion]had long[/deletion] been exposed to

on the top of this [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical] in the neck

of the matrass was affixed the

The alkaline [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
is capable of combining with a
larger quantity of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical].
20 grains were inserted into a cylinder
filled with [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical], 3 cubic
inches of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] were admitted
this gas was absorbed pretty rapidly
at first but more slowly afterwards
in an hour & half there
was a diminution of 2 3/4 of
a cubic inch, the carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] was very little altered
it was impossible to determine
its increase of temperature.

When the [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical] is
suffered to remain in close vessels
it undergoes little or no alteration
& sublimes very slowly indeed, a
Philes was filled with it & closed
with a glass stopper, in about a
month a no of small chrystals
had formed on the sides & upper
part of the phial; but the
remaining salt had undergone
no alteration it contained the
same quantity of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
as before - When the carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] is exposed to the
Atmosphere it undergoes great
alterations it loses its solid form
& shoots into chrystals its
alkaline smell is lost & its
taste much less pungent. it no
longer possesses the property of turning

I first supposed that these changes
were produced by the simple absorption
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] & that the
salt increased in weight to ascertain
this, I exposed 100 grains of salt
to the atmosphere, 100 grains
more were placed in the exhausted
receiver after remaining in this
situation for 12 hours they
were weighed, the salt in vacuo
had lost 5 1/2 grains & was apparently
unaltered in its properties, the other
had lost 1 2/5 it was a little
opaque on its upper surface but
had undergone no other change - -
I learnt from this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that
the loss of weight was greater
than the increase & that the
salt evaporated rapidly at the

[page]60|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00060|dnp20b058pp|62576510[/page]
58
common temperature or that it
gave out [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] & thus became
neutralised, to ascertain these
circumstances. 100 grains of salt
were exposed [chemical]chemical_007|[deletion]to Hydrogen gas[/deletion][/chemical]
[deletion]under[/deletion]r in a cylinder containing
Atmospheric air under [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
at a pressure of 27 1/2 in
three days a small quantity
of salt was observed on the
top & sides of the cylinder
Mem[superscript]m[/superscript]: the expt in the [person]person_386|torricellian[/person]
vacuum; but 50 grains of
the salt which were analyzed
contained, their just proportion
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] : & the volume
of the air remained the same
the thermo[superscript]l[/superscript] & barometrical pressure

[page]61|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00061|dnp20b059pp|62576511[/page]
59
being accounted for
50 [insertion]powdered[/insertion] grains of the salt were now exposed
to [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] 360 grain measures
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical], the thermometer standing
at 62 & the Barometer at 30,3
a diminution slowly took place &
in absorbtion of 10 1/2 took place in
half an hour. the salt was rather
whiter than before & had lost in
a great measure its alkaline
smell.
50 grains of the salt were now
exposed to [deletion]Alkaline[/deletion] 6 cubic inches of
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] a rapid absorbtion took
place, the whole was absorbed, the
temperature of the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
confining the gas was gradually
raised to 160.[superscript]o[/superscript] the ammoniacal
gas was increased to 10 1/2 for a
few minutes no contraction or
expansion was perceived, then an
expansion took place with considerable

[page]62|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00062|dnp20b060pp|62576512[/page]
60
rapidity. the cylinder was filled
with air, a small quantity of
this air was admitted into
another cylinder & sufficient to cool
a contraction of 2 took place
& white clouds were formed -
the remaining air was [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
These exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] appeared contradictory, the
absorption of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] in the cold
was a fact that I was unable
to account for, the salt appeared
to contain already a large portion
of superabundant [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]. [deletion]A[/deletion]
To ascertain the changes effected in
the salt by its exposure to the
atmosphere, the following exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was
made. 100 grains of carbonate were
finely powdered & exposed under [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
to, 30,50, grain measures of Carbonic
acid, in about an hour there was

[page]63|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00063|dnp20b061pp|62576513[/page]
61
an absorption of 300 grains, the
absorbtion continued to go on
rapidly for some hours, then more
slowly, in 48 hours, the diminution
was to 2008 grains - the 100 grains
of salt were collected they had
altogether lost their alkaline smell
the small pieces were perfectly whitened
externally & viewed thro' the microscope
had evidently chrystalised, it was impossible
to ascertain exactly the increase of
weight gained by this salt as it
was blackened by the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
& had small particles mingled with
it no water was deposited on the
side of the [deletion]tube[/deletion] cylinder, 50 grains
were analised in the mode just
described they [deletion]had gained[/deletion] now contained
51 p[superscript]r[/superscript] cent [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical], their quantity
of water of chrystalisation appeared to
be increased - The changes effected

[page]64|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00064|dnp20b062pp|62576514[/page]
62
100 grains of [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
containing 47 P[superscript]r[/superscript] cent of carbonic
acid, 36 Alkali & 18 water
were exposed to 43 cubic inches
of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] on the top of
[misc]misc_281|clayfields airholder[/misc] [deletion]the airholder[/deletion]
was filled with carbonic [deletion]acid[/deletion]
they were suffered to remain
there for some time, in about 12
hours a diminuation of [unclear]25[/unclear] cubic
inches was perceived, in [underline]about[/underline], 2
days, but 3 cubic inches of carbonic
acid remained, the salt had
aqccquired all the properties that depend
on acidification, it was now analised
in the mode before adopted, & appeared
to contain -

NB in these analysis, there are
the following circumstances to be considered
1. the bulk of the gas at a given temperature
which being given its weight is also given
2. the difference between the weight
of the gas & the weight lost by the
[chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
this difference is water saturated
with [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], which water being
dissolved by the [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] at a high
temperature is thrown down [deletion]again[/deletion]
when thrown down it dissolves
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], to know the quantity
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] & water in this we
may make use of the following
formula. it was first essential
to determine, the quantity of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
condensed by a known quantity of
distilled water & its diminution
of density the specific gravity of
compleatly caustic [chemical]chemical_356|spirit of ammonia[/chemical]
is

[page]66|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00066|dnp20b064pp|62576516[/page]
64
30 grains of water must be saturated
with [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], the quantity of
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] dissolved marked, the
specific gravity of [chemical]chemical_356|spirit of ammonia[/chemical]
is known, the weight of this is
known. then [deletion]Amon[/deletion] the deficiency
of weight must be divided in
proportion to the quantity of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
& water in a solution of caustic
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical].

[page]67|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00067|dnp20b065pp|62576517[/page]
65
From these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] it is evident that
there exist many varieties of carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical], the common carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] of commerce is not
saturated with [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] &
is even capable of combining with
a larger quantity of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical],
To ascertain whether slight differences
of temperature would produce any
differences in the quantities of carbonic
acid & [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] entering into combination
the following exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were made
1500 grain measures of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]
obtained from the decomposition
of [chemical]chemical_357|Sulphate of Ammonia[/chemical] by [chemical]chemical_010|Lime[/chemical]
which had been passed thro Carbonate
of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] to deprive it of its moisture
was mingled with 500 grains of carbonic
acid under [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] - A diminution
took place & about 320 grain measures
remained - this proved to be pure
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] temperature in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was 63
Barometer 30,6

[page]68|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00068|dnp20b066pp|62576518[/page]

[deletion]3[/deletion] 2010 grain measures of
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] were now [deletion]exposed[/deletion] confined
in a cylinder under [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical]
& 500 of [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical], the temperature
of the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] was raised 110
which is the greatest heat in
which I could bear my hands
a rapid diminution had evidently
taken place when the [chemical]chemical_012|[deletion]mercury[/deletion][/chemical]
[deletion]was[/deletion] cylinder was removed no farther
absorbtion took place about
300 grains remained which
were [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical]. -
These exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were repeated with
the same results. -
The difficulties which occur in making
them are that both [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] &
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] in the production
generally carry over water which
is deposited, it is difficult to

[page]69|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00069|dnp20b067pp|62576519[/page]
67
free your [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] perfectly from water.
The [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] was generally carefully
cleaned before it was used &
heated to evaporate the moisture.
With great difficulty, I mingled
together 4 [insertion]of[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] with 4 of carbonic
acid, the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] being at the
temperature of 180. a contraction
of about 2 took place but no
white clouds were formed, when
the gas was removed from the
heated [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] into cold, a
diminution rapidly took place
& white clouds were formed, when
the condensation was compleat, there
remained about 2 1/2 of carbonic
acid, from hence it appears that
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] combine
at high temperature & still retain
the [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] state. -

a piece of solid [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
was inserted into a cylinder of the
capacity of 360 grains, the temperature
being 62. A hot iron was plunged
into the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] no gas was
liberated till the [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] became
heated to 130°, at this temperature
gas began to be slowly given out
as was perceived at the temperature
of 200[superscript]o[/superscript] gas was generated very
rapidly when the cylinder was
[deletion]nearly[/deletion] full to 7 measures it was
transferred into another vessel
a diminution rapidly took &

We have already mentioned 2 distinct
varieties of [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical]
one of which is partially saturated
with [chemical]chemical_003|[deletion]Ammonia[/deletion][/chemical] [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] the
other of which is perfectly neutralised
there exists a third variety
which is perfectly distinct from
either of those & which is produced
when [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] is driven off
from [chemical]chemical_251|Carbonate of Ammonia[/chemical].

quantity of water remained in
the retort. NB the gas was clouded
as it came over, carbonate of

top & sides of the cylinder, when
the cylinder was taken off a
smell of alkaline gas was perceived
& on bringing it near my
nose, an irritation on the
nose & mouth was produced so
strong as almost to deprive
me of sense. from this I
thought it probable that a
diminution of temperature strengthened
the union between [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical]
& [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] to such a degree as
to cause the expulsion [unclear]xx superabundant[/unclear]

The first step towards these laws will
be the decomposition of these
bodies which are at present
undecomposed. & the & probably
no class of substances will throw
greater light on this than
the [chemical]chemical_342|ammoniacal salts[/chemical] & it
is astonishing that since the
decomposition of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] in
the [chemical]chemical_094|Nitrate of Ammonia[/chemical] by
[person]person_005|Berthollet[/person] no attempts should
have been made to decompose
the other Acids in these salts.
From the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that follow
it will appear that all
the [chemical]chemical_342|ammoniacal salts[/chemical] undergo
great changes by heat & that
in many of them at high
temperatures the [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] &
[chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] mutually decompose each
[unclear]other[/unclear]

single and double affinities & even the union
between the Acids & Alkalies & metallic
oxyds [insertion]has been considered as effected[/insertion] by the simple attractions of
the individual compounds, nothing
has been done towards estimating the
attractions of the simple principles
in compound substances. The perfection
of Chemical philosophy or the
Laws of corpuscular motion must
depend on the knowledge of all
the simple substances their mutual
attractions & the ratio in which
these attractions increase or diminish
on increase or diminution of
temperature. These being ascertained
chemistry would become a science
So far generalised as to enable
calculations to be formed with
regard to the result of any
new apposition of particles.

The brilliant discoveries which have
enriched Chemical science in these latter
days have perhaps induced the philosophers
who made them to conclude too hastily
that the science was arrived at
perfection, a number of brilliant
discoveries have been made & on certain
points theory has advanced with
certainty of truth.
But when we consider our inability
to calculate results, our ignorance
of the attractions that bind many
principles together & of the composition
of organic matter, we shall find
that the field of Nature is yet
but little explored & that the most
sublime & most important part
of Chemistry is as yet unkown
The chemical discoveries that have made
& the theory as far as it has been
pushed has extended to simply classing

the effects were a degree

Dissatisfied with this trial I procured

more that of pressure on the

this gradually diminished & was
succeeded, by a thrilling in the

general pleasurable feeling seemed
to absorb existence, ideas were
more rapidly associated together
& at last an irresistible
propensity to muscular action
was indulged in, I recollect
but faintly what happened
I know that my muscular actions
were strong and rapid.-
These astonishing effects very soon
ceased in ten minutes I had
recovered my former state, the
recollections of them were so
imperfect that I had some difficulty

The next day of course I was
anxious to repeat the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
I went into the laboratory

took 4 quarts from an airholder

[chemical]chemical_048|the gas[/chemical]. On breathing this

it produced no effects whatever

which however slight deserved
to be noticed, To ascertain

to its accelerating or retarding
the progress of sleep, I breathed
one evening about eight o Clock

between each. The feelings
at the time were less pleasant
than I generally experienced
them; indeed the gas was
impure & breathed too soon
after its production it contained
some suspended N Acid vapor
& stimulated the lungs so as

neither to increase or diminish

these phaenomena probably depended
more on a wish to carry
on experimental investigation
much interesting me than on
the small quantities of air
inspired - My appetite was
the same as usual & my
pulse not altered - for some
time after the inspiration of
the gas there was generally
a sort of mental indolence
produced probably by the
pleasurable feeling [insertion]connected with [unclear]nowant[/unclear][/insertion], During the

wrote down the following account
of the experiment. - "The feelings

a certain soreness in one

[deletion]these feelings went off very soon[/deletion]
[deletion]After[/deletion] In 2 minutes these likewise disappeared
From this experiment I was almost
inclined to beleive that my newly

however I had an opportunity

I made on myself with the gas
yet still I was not satisifed
that it was analogous to
stimulants in general. -
There was no instance in which
excitement had been carried
to that extent in which
it is uniformly accompanied
by exhaustion under the agency
of other powers. -
[Horizontal rule]
Two modes of ascertaining
its specific agency occurred. -
the first by exhausting the
system by excessive stimulation
NB in some experiments acuteness of hearing
was distinct -

administration of the gas for such

excitement equal in duration
to that produced by intoxication
[deletion]both those modes have been[/deletion]
The first of these experiments
was made on Dec 23

produce its full effects. - They were
compleat intoxication; they were
disagreable fulness of the head, inability

[deletion]&[/deletion] very much increased the
langor & produced something
like a disposition to fainting -
alarmed a little, I took
twelve quarts of [chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical], to
determine if its effects were
analogous - these produced
no feeling at the time
but just after breathing them
I felt rather more agreeably
I now took again seven quarts
of [chemical]chemical_048|gaseous oxyd[/chemical]: it produced
feelings such as usual, pleasant
with disposition to muscular

Observations on the philosophy of Heat
and Light. -
- by H. Davy. -
At the time of the publication of my essays
on Light & Heat I was a very young
experimenter; from my situation
unacquainted with a number of
important works on those abstruse
subjects
Since that time my knowledge of
facts has increased [deletion]& my scepticism[/deletion]
[deletion]with regard to th[/deletion] & this knowledge
of facts has produced in me a
scepticism with regard to the theories
of light & Heat in general but
in spite of this scepticism the
Theory I have heretofore adopted
appears to me still the most
probable. -

1 Bodies under certain circumstances [insertion]without being altered in their visible appearance or weight[/insertion] become
expanded & when expanded possess the
property of communicating expansion to other
bodies & of themselves become contracted.
2 There are a few solitary instances
in which bodies become expanded themselves
whilst they communicate expansion to
other bodies, ice, iron &c.
3. When bodies possess the powers of
expanding others to a very great extent
they are generally luminous ie
they throw off rays of light in
all directions
4. In the combinations of
bodies, the bodies often become
contracted & then they generally expand
the bodies in contact with them. -
5 When this expansion is very
great they produce as in the
other cases light
6. In many decompositions &

141
combinations a power to expand other
bodies is connected with a very
great expansion of the bodies themselves.
7 The expansion of organ - is the
sensation we call Heat
8 Bodies expand in all dimensions without
being materially altered in their properties
till they become fluid, [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc]
& so on, then they are very
much altered. -
Two conclusions; must follow from
the phaenomena of expansion -
1. When a body expands its particles
must move from each other -
2 After expansion the attractive
forces of the particles for each other
 must be less than before –

[page]146|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00146|dnp20b142pp|62576596[/page]
142
The great question to be determined is
whether this motion of particles
from each other & the consiquent
diminution of Attraction is a
phaenomenon depending upon
the simple communication of motion
or whether it is effected by
the agency of a peculiar substance
having affinity for all bodies &
which either chemically combines with
their particles or insinuates itself between
them so as to produce their
seperation.
[deletion]The [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] The facts in favor of the
1 first hypothesis are [unclear]1[superscript]st[/superscript][/unclear] that bodies
can be expanded by friction without
being in contact with bodies
capable of communicating heat

elementary book in my possession
was the first that I studied
In that system, an imaginary
being called Caloric engaged my

too much neglected light, & this
great source of our sensations engaged
my attention, to ascertain a universal
concomitance between what is called
sensible heat or heat of temperature
& light first engaged my attention

I find [deletion]but[/deletion] reasons for relinquishing

Prejudice, & ignorance her eternal

No one will deny the existence of
motion no one will deny that
expansion is the only measure of heat
In expansion if you allow the
existence of particles they must
move or separate from each other
The phenomena of condensation of
fluids & gases producing what
is called increased temperature
is another fact unconnected
with expansion & requires to
be differently reasoned upon.
I was perhaps wrong in publishing
with such haste a new Theory of
Chemistry & my mind was ardent
& enthusiastic. I believed I had
discovered the truth, since that
time my knowledge of facts is
increased, since that time I
have become more sceptical

These critics perhaps do not understand
that these experiments were made at a
time when I had studied Chemistry
but four months, when I had never
seen a single experiment executed
+ & when all my chemical information
was derived from [misc]misc_390|Nicholson's Chemistry[/misc]
& [person]person_030|Lavoisiers[/person] [otherwork]otherwork_056|elements[/otherwork]. They do not
perhaps consider that my apparatus
could not be made more perfect

asserted that their inaccuracy have
been determined by some eminent
chemists, who are these eminent
chemists there are few enough
God knows in [place]place_121|England[/place]. They were
often repeated & they will in

in this state of Nature He was probably
totally unable to trace any connexion
between a certain state of his organs
& painful sensation. Pleasure & pain being
both associated with his organs, he easily referred
pleasure & pain to other ideas, Hence it was not
the finger which gave him the [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of fear

which touched it: afterwards finding a certain
appearance of organ connected with pain He
referred the pain to this appearance & the
pain was no longer associated with the

Introduction. Man was long before he discovered the
true connexion of cause & effect. Science & civilization
[unclear]more[/unclear] from his wants the objects of which tho' originally
near became gradually more remote. The invention
of language gave him a class of regularly associated
ideas. which enabled him to perceive similarly
to other men at nearly the same time.
It is this language which raised him from
the savage state which enabled him to volutarily
to call up ideas & passions & to employ them
for the purpose of gaining new sensations.
The discovery of the use of permanent signs
which should raise similar ideas in the
minds of all individuals is writing whether
Hieroglyphic or Alphabetic was the next
important step by this art the labor [deletion]of[/deletion] &
Genius of the individual no longer died
with him or only extended to his contemporaries
existing in characters it became immortal
Hence inventions were accumulated this
than profited by the labor of the philosopher
who lived before him & laid a foundation
from which a future age was to erect

I can mean nothing more or less than the visible

impressions cannot be so well called part of
self as they are variable & infinitely different
except those words I, self myself eye nose
&c. which are connected often with our
impressions & ideas, The sensations we call
self [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] are petually [insertion][unclear]rpetualy[/unclear][/insertion] occuring & are more or
or less connected with all our other trains

[deletion][unclear]Morality or the xxxxxxx which teaches[/unclear][/deletion]
The power of regulating our actions must
be deduced from experience - those actions
are in fact the result of our [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] own ideas
our passions & present sensations.
Morality is a science which teaches us
rightly to associate pleasure & pain with
our ideas - we find almost perpetualy
in metaphysical books allusions to mind
as the being in which sensations ideas
&c exist, they ought first to have
defined the word mind is it an idea
or a pleasure or pain or a sensation
I do not find that it is either of
these it must then be a word
expressing either all our sensations ideas
pleasures & pains or some of them
We will first consider what is the
true meaning of the word self. -

Vital air. in the process of combustion
the combustible body & the vital air
disappear, with great Heat & the liberation
