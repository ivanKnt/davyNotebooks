[blockdeletion]A few days since M[superscript]r[/superscript] Coates of Clifton requested me
to examine a phenomenon which his son had

D1
A few days ago M[superscript]r[/superscript] Coates of Clifton informed
me that his son accidentally rubbing two
pieces of bonnet cane together in the dark
had perceived a luminous appearance -
This [insertion]unknown[/insertion] phaenomenon was sufficiently curious
to induce me to examine it - I found that
all Canes of this kind . A. [unclear]N[/unclear]. when rubbed
briskly together produced vivid sparks of Light-
The luminous appearance was much more vivid
in collision. When the canes were violently
struck together sparks nearly as brilliant
as those from the gunlock were produced.
while at the same time a strong
smell similar [deletion]D2.[/deletion] that perceived during

the collision of flint or the excitement
of the electric fluid was observed. -

I at first thought it probable that
the phaenomenon was electric & depended
upon some resinous matter in the cane

The electrometer however was not sensibly

To determine whether the effect depended on
some substance in the whole of the cane
or in the epidermis alone, I removed
the latter - when the canes deprived of

I first examined the Avena P. or

I examined Anthoxanthemum or vernal
meadow grass. Holcus mollis & 2 others
appeared to contain more [deletion]epiderm[/deletion]

The silex in all these vegetables

a reticular appearance -
The bamboo has likewise an epidermis

of Silex - The sugar cane Canna

calcareous - The quantity of
Potash in the grasses induced me
to suppose that in a strong heat
they might be fused into Glass -
In the reed the quantity was
not sufficient; it remained unaltered
in the strongest Heat I could
give it. The ashes of straw urged
by a strong Heat gave a white

Our Ignorance of the functions of life, the the consequent

dispose thinking men to doubt of the efficacy
of every new mode of practice till it has been
established by the test of experiment & erected
on the basis of time: - To this scepticism they

promoting every investigation which affords
the most distant hopes of benefiting Humanity
by destroying painful sensation - if all
Men were actuated by this spirit Medical
science would not have remained so long
uncertain. To attempt to prove [deletion]to mankind[/deletion]
the imperfection of the medical art would be
an insult on the common sense of mankind
Not many of those painful diseases which
first render Death desirable & then produce

the most promising of the Human species are
continually falling the victims of a lingering &
painful disease. It would be an unnecessary
labor to bring forward a catalogue of the
terrible maladies which are perpetually casting

to [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] prove to mankind that at every time
of life & in every situation they have reason
to fear, the Daemon of incurable disease
No [insertion]any[/insertion] individual is uninterested in the [deletion]progress[/deletion] [insertion]improvement[/insertion] 
of Medical Science. That Medical Science
is capable of improvement is a truth that
no one can doubt. To prove it we need but
cast our eyes on the History of medicine
[deletion]Many dis[/deletion] some diseases formerly incurable now
yield to the power of medicine, Many maladies
which formerly depopulated Nations are now
almost exterminated. What has been done proves
to Mankind that they are capable of doing
The physical Science, in their gradual approximation
towards man are every day unfolding more
of his nature. Chemistry has opened to us
a new field for the improvement of medical
science. The knowledge of some of the functions
of Life & particularly of Respiration long ago le[deletion]a[/deletion]d
many philosophers to suppose that diseases might
be cured by the application of airs to the
lungs, by producing chemical changes or
altering the atmosphere. - To the investigation
of this opinion in private practice a
number of difficulties almost insurmountable
presented themselves.

[page]15|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00015|dnp20b013pp|62576465[/page]

few private individuals were capable of procuring
an app[superscript]s[/superscript] perfectly adequate to this important
purpose. besides the passions & prejudices of
Mankind opposed themselves to this mode
of pursuing the investigation. One class
of Medical professors attached to the present
[deletion]mode of[/deletion] practice from self interest or [deletion]the[/deletion]
ambition one might naturally suppose would
oppose in every possible way every attempt at
innovation. Another class fond of novelty in the
warmth of their imagination have supposed that
Pneumatic medicine born all perfect was to supercede
every other mode of practice & to give to Man
almost immortality - A third Class, by far the
most dangerous have made it the instrument
of quackery have made use of it to deceive
Mankind & to fill their own pockets.
To do away these difficulties, to investigate
fairly Pneumatic Medicine [place]place_645|This Institution[/place]
was originally proposed by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes. It
has been supported, it has been supported
by the liberal and enlighted physicians of
England & by the greater number of those
Philosophers who have the true interest
of their species at heart. -
From their support it has been
established. The present subscription is adequate
to the execution of a number of important

exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] certain circumstances induce to hope
that it will be increased & made adequate
to the perfect completion of the design -
[deletion]By calling the attention of medical & philosophical[/deletion]
[deletion]Men to the great object of [place]place_645|the institution[/place][/deletion]
[deletion]we may hope for the invention of plans[/deletion]
The House in Dowry square is admirably
adapted for the purposes of the investigation. -
[deletion]No difficulty will be foun[/deletion] an app[superscript]s[/superscript] is

procuring them in quantities sufficiently
large to make conclusive exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] -
The patients are more numerous than
could have been expected upwards

this fortnight & we could immediately
fill the House with in patients.

To determine the quantity of ammonia

very difficult. I effected it however

the second I succeeded. the water
of chrystalisation of the ammonia
was attracted by the caustic lime
layer after layer - whilst the
ammonia was liberated - the loss
of weight in this experiment was
20.5. - [underline]Mem[superscript]m[/superscript] the deliquescent salt[/underline]
I found that the water left the
salt at a lower temperature
than that of its sublimation. -
I attempted to drive of the water
without subliming the salt
in this manner, I put

the loss of weight was 26, two grains
more than it ought to have been
-. Sulphuric acid poured upon this
salt liberated 51 grains of carbonic
acid. from which I conclude that
some of the carbonic acid was
driven of as well as the
water of chrystalisation. -

The perfection of the chemistry of inanimate Nature
will depend not more on the exact knowledge
of all, the effects produced by the changes constantly
taking place in matter; than on an exact
classification of those changes according to some
law. or to speak more accurately it is not
enough that we perceive every possible resemblance
of our sensations & ideas which may become
their associating link; we must likewise
learn to represent this link by terms &
by discovering a similarity in links we must
generalise terms. & then discover common or
universal laws. -
By comparing the forces by which solids & fluids
are seperated into parts we may be enabled
to form some judgment respecting their
cohesive attraction or that power by which
their particles are preserved in a state
of contiguity the comparison of this force
with [insertion]the[/insertion] expansive power of bodies by increase
of their repulsive motion, or the diminution
of their bulk by the diminution of their
repulsive motion as abstracted by a body

The attraction between Ammonia & the acids
is increased by every [deletion]dimi[/deletion] increase of temperature
or the quantity of acid required to

A quantity of carbonic acid extremely pure

the application of Heat, 20 parts of this
were measured. - A quantity of Ammonia
42 was added to this till no farther diminution
took place. a quantity equal to four
remained in the tube this gas proved to
be ammonia - from this expt it is
evident that at the temperature of 64[superscript]o[/superscript]

to saturate 20 parts of carbonic acid

To determine the different quantity of
carbonic acid combinable with Ammonia at
a higher temperature I made the following
exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. The mercury in the trough was
heated to near [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] 200[superscript]o[/superscript] & the Gases of the

were employed - 20 parts of carbonic acid
at the temperature of 120 [insertion]o[/insertion] to which the 
mercury was lowered at the time the
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was made took up nearly 56 parts
of ammoniacal gas. -
This expt
A very great source of error in these
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] is the different degree of solubility
of the gases in water. Ammonia, carbonic
acid & muriatic acid dissolve different
proportions of water & are themselves
soluble in very different quantities
at a high temperature that of their
production. They carry over a considerable
quantity of water in solution which is thrown
down when they come in contact with
the cold mercury, this the water thrown down

When we say I think it is most
likely such results will necessarily
take place we have certain ideas
of vision & touch connected with

sensations which always give us
either new ideas or modify our

The philosophers who have [deletion]treated as[/deletion] written
on Man have generally began by
generalising terms by laying down certain
laws & arranging phaenomena according
to these laws. This mode of
philosophising belongs to the imaginative
faculties not to the [deletion]invention[/deletion]
reasoning powers. nothing is more easy
than to give a history of what we
know to associate by the links of
analogies all our perceptions &
ideas we do not so much want
a 'History of Man'. What meaning
can propositions like these convey
when taken for general principles of
reasoning Man is composed to 2 parts

dissolves the gas. & the ammoniacal
gas is more soluble than the carbonic
acid, & the muri[superscript]c[/superscript] than the ammonical
so that if very great care be not
taken these circumstances will be a source
of error.
The investigation of chemical affinity has

little attended to. The order of the
affinities of the A for the alkalies
have been classed by B & K. -
Our principle must be laid down that
every principle in combination must
exert a distinct attraction. Sulphuric
acid can exert no attraction as sulphuric
acid. its attraction must be exerted
as the attraction of Sulphur & of
Oxygen the order of affinity of the acid.

We reason, or rather we ought to reason from
our sensations or ideas by means of words
We ought to use no words, that do
not express some ideas or some sensations
The great error of Men of Science in
forming systems is that they have hardly
ever made use of accurate terms -
Of the living principle, the immaterial
principle & the [unclear]xx[/unclear] of the Animation -
These are all words without meaning
Mind has hardly ever a definite
meaning given to it, of Physiology
in its strict sense. [insertion]of consciousness & I or self. we have no business with these questions, whether matter or mind exists, they neither exist[/insertion] It is - the science
which teaches us to connect all our
sensations & ideas to others which we
call organs - for example all our
sensations of sight depend on the eye
& so on, more refined physiology
goes on & investigates brain nerve &
muscular fibre. [deletion]A correspondence between[/deletion]
This is all analogical reasoning, we

We suppose the same connection between
our sensations & words which we call
our organs or visible ideas gained from
other beings & applied to our selves
This mode of reasoning discovers to
us that the healthy state of the system
is dependant on a certain constitution
of organ it proves to us that
a certain arrangment of the
principles of the irritable fibre is
essential to its irritability, a nerve
that was once sensible & that
ceases to become sensible must have
had some change effected in it, so
must a muscular fibre, this
change is not immediately evident
it consequently can not be mechanical
& might be chemical -
to the senses it must have either
lose some principles, gain some principles
or possess a new arrangment of its
principles reasons for supposing
that the fibre loses principles when it

to support life - Arterial blood
becomes venous difference between

whyle different from other venous
blood - light & oxygen perpetually
expended in animal action, the
contraction of muscular fibre may
be produced by a new arrangment
of its principles, of the restoration of its
irritability by the venous blood
accurate analyses of the differences
of the arterial & venous blood
promises to explain much of the function
of life - the differences of principles
in these two would explain was

action - Light probably is the
principle which is perpetually combining

into electric fluid by combining with
some unknown principle.

Of the Combinations of Ammonia
with the Acids & phosacids -
I was not so much induced to initiate the
following exp[superscript]s[/superscript] from a consideration of the
importance of investigating the complex
attractions which unite the numerous
simple principles of these substances & their
connexion with sublime Chemistry, nor from
considering the labors of others. The
Investigation of the properties of the Nitrous
phosoxyd obliged me to pay particular attention
to the composition & properties of the
phosnitrate of Ammonia from which this
gas is obtained - I made this salt by
decomposing the carbonate of Ammonia
by N P Acid - After the saturation
was compleat at the common temp[superscript]e[/superscript] of
the Atmosphere I observed that carbonate
of Ammonia thrown into the aqueous
solution of this salt heated produced
 effervescence – [deletion]I[/deletion] the conclusion formed

[page]44|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00044|dnp20b042pp|62576494[/page]
42
was the following, that at a high
temperature the [deletion]carbon[/deletion] N of Ammonia
acts the part of an acid & disloges
the carbonic acid from the carbonate
of Ammonia - I found that when
the effervescence had ceased the salt
which in this way is rarely obtained
in regular chrystals, had a more
alkaline taste & that it rendered
green vegetables blues. - The Heated
solutions of N of Ammonia, &c had
all the property of disloging the
Carbonic acid from the carbonate
of Ammonia, Hence I at first
suspected that the attractions of the
acids for Ammonia were increased
by increase of temperature, In attempting
to ascertain the increase of weight
of the phosnitrate of Ammonia - I was
surprised by finding a diminution of
weight instead of an increase these &
some other circumstances induced me
to suppose that the carbonic acid was

[page]45|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00045|dnp20b043pp|62576495[/page]
43
detached from the ammonia by the
heat that an alkaline carbonate
of Ammonia was formed which at

case & [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] to clear up the

[ink sketch of a face in profile]
The Salts with bases of Ammonia are among
the most compound substances which Chemistry
is capable of creating. In their formation
& existence a number of attractions are
concerned. The investigation of the forces
of those attractions would be the first
step towards the Knowledge of the Laws
of complex affinity, a branch of philosophy
as yet but little understood.
The analysts of the Neutral salts Bergman
Kirwan & A have disagreed in their
general results In the combinations
of Ammonia with the acids their
differences have been extremely great, which
we shall find no reason to wonder at
when we consider that they paid no
attention to the differences of temperature

& to other circumstances which peculiarly
belong to this class of substances.

[insertion]well known chemical facts.[/insertion]
in Crells chemical Journal. Engl[superscript]h[/superscript] Translation
page 113. says the attraction of acids
to the volatile alkali is very much weakened
 by the application of a certain quantity
of heat, if the acid is of a fixed or almost
fixed Nature this uniting power over the
attraction is almost entirely destroyed. Hence
on the application of such a due degree
of heat the volatile Alkali is disengaged
from phos[superscript]c[/superscript] Arsenic: & vitriolic cal:Am
This volatile Alkali then assumes an
aerial form: & retains this form as long
as it does not come in contact with
water; but if it meets with water it
unites therewith, loses its elasticity & lets go
as much heat as was necessary for imparting
to it its uniform quality, Here then we
have the caustic spirit of Sal Ammoniac

We know that steam [deletion]&[/deletion] absorbs heat
& that when a portion of heat is abstracted
water is produced; but this water still
contains a considerable quantity of heat
in a latent state - The same thing
happens in the case of the caustic
spirit of Sal ammonia it still retains
heat - Fourcroy in his traite elementaire
has mentioned the fact relating to
the Sulphate of Ammonia as
discovered by B. - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatcheet in
his analysis of the M of lead has
related some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the decomposition
of the Sulphate of Ammonia by
heat. He states the products of
this decomposition to be Nitrogen
Ammonia & sulphureous acid &
from some reasons concludes
that the muriatic acid is
partially seperable from its Base
by Heat & that many of the neutral
salts will be found to be alterable

in their history of the combinations

the Sulphate of Ammonia like
the Sulphate gives out Ammoniacal

I first endeavored to analise the common carbonate
of Ammonia in such a way as guard against
the liberation of its carbonic acid with other
products of the carbonate of Ammonia of
commerce there are two varieties which generally
exist together, the outside of the one is white
Carbonate of Ammonia of Commerce
This salt when it has been kept close
is in solid semitransparent masses,
it presents no regular chrystalisation
its smell is [deletion]alkaline[/deletion] like that of
caustic Ammonia it turns Vegetable
Hues green its taste is pungent &
alkaline - this was the middle part
the outside is always carbonate
100 grains of this salt [deletion]were inserted[/deletion]
in a higher degree.
[deletion]into a matrass[/deletion] were decomposed
by 200 grains of sulphuric acid of
the specific gravity of 1,741 , the loss
of weight amounted to 47 grains -
A considerable degree of heat was produced
during the process which produced
an evaporation of some carbonate

[page]52|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00052|dnp20b050pp|62576502[/page]
50
of Ammonia & sulphuric acid undecomposed
To ascertain the deficiency of weight
from this loss 100 grains were
decomposed by 200 grains of Sulphuric
acid diluted with 500 grains of
water. there was no sensible
heat produced during this process
the loss of weight was [deletion]4[/deletion] 16,8/4
200 grains of acid were now
diluted with 1000 grains of water
in the decomposition of 100
grains of carbonate of Ammonia
by this the loss of weight was 46
When the salt was gently heated
small globules of air were disengaged
from whence it appears that
Carbonic acid was held in
solution - from these different
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][deletion]it[/deletion] we must take the second

[page]53|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00053|dnp20b051pp|62576503[/page]
51
as giving the most accurate result in
this the heat produced was not
sufficient to occasion a great loss
from evaporation & the water [insertion]was insufficient to[/insertion] hold
in solution any perceptible quantity
of carbonic acid. -
800 grains of Carbonate of Ammonia
were mingled with 400 grains of
[unclear]He[superscript]d[/superscript][/unclear] caustic lime, the matrass into
which they were inserted was accurately
weighed & a pneumatic app[superscript]s[/superscript] applied
to it, this app[superscript]s[/superscript] communicated
with C. mercurial airholder
on the application of a low heat
gas began to be disengaged -
I feared lest this gas should be
carbonic acid, as I had before
found that dry lime was incapable
of decomposing the dry carbonate of
Ammonia, on increasing the heat
a diminution of the gas already formed

[page]54|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00054|dnp20b052pp|62576504[/page]
52
began to take place & white
clouds were formed, gas then began
to pass over & about 46 cubic
inches were collected which were
ammonia, the mattrass was now
weighed The loss was 56 - From
this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it is evident that
dry caustic lime is incapable of
attracting Carbonic acid from
ammonia, portion of it with
probably some salt flies off in the
increase of temperature & the lime
does not begin to act on the
Carbonate of Ammonia till it is
fused in its water of Chrystalisation.
Lime slightly wetted was now
employed 500 parts to 100 of Carbonate
of Ammonia in this way 115 cubic
inches of gas were collected; but a
considerable quantity of water came over
& the gas was slightly clouded, the loss

[page]55|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00055|dnp20b053pp|62576505[/page]
53
of weight was 5,3. The gas carried over
a large quantity of water at this
temperature which it deposited on
cooling, this water absorbed much
of the gas, whilst a part of the
salt probably rose and composed
so that this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was perfectly
undecisive. -
500 grains were now mingled with
200 grains of slacked lime slightly wetted
over this was inserted a quantity of caustic
lime which [deletion]had long[/deletion] been exposed to
a white heat about an hour before
on the top of this lime in the neck
of the matrass was inserted about 200[superscript]gr[/superscript]
of [insertion]dry[/insertion] carbonate of potash. To the neck
of the matrass was affixed the
mercurial app[superscript]s[/superscript] The heat of a
spirit lamp was applied to the
bottom of the matrass.

This salt is [deletion]not[/deletion] capable of giving out
& of combining with carbonic acid
I had found in two or three instances
[deletion]that at the heat[/deletion]
Absorbtion of carbonic acid
by the Carbonate of Ammonia
The alkaline Carbonate of ammonia
is capable of combining with a
larger quantity of carbonic acid.
20 grains were inserted into a cylinder
filled with mercury, 3 cubic
inches of carbonic acid were admitted
this gas was absorbed pretty rapidly
at first but more slowly afterwards
in an hour & half there
was a diminution of 2 3/4 of
a cubic inch, the carbonate
of Ammonia was very little altered
it was impossible to determine
its increase of temperature.

[page]58|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00058|dnp20b056pp|62576508[/page]
56
When the carbonate of Ammonia is
suffered to remain in close vessels
it undergoes little or no alteration
& sublimes very slowly indeed, a
Philes was filled with it & closed
with a glass stopper, in about a
month a no of small chrystals
had formed on the sides & upper
part of the phial; but the
remaining salt had undergone
no alteration it contained the
same quantity of carbonic acid
as before - When the carbonate
of Ammonia is exposed to the
Atmosphere it undergoes great
alterations it loses its solid form
& shoots into chrystals its
alkaline smell is lost & its
taste much less pungent. it no
longer possesses the property of turning

[page]59|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00059|dnp20b057pp|62576509[/page]
57
green vegetable blues.
I first supposed that these changes
were produced by the simple absorption
of carbonic acid & that the
salt increased in weight to ascertain
this, I exposed 100 grains of salt
to the atmosphere, 100 grains
more were placed in the exhausted
receiver after remaining in this
situation for 12 hours they
were weighed, the salt in vacuo
had lost 5 1/2 grains & was apparently
unaltered in its properties, the other
had lost 1 2/5 it was a little
opaque on its upper surface but
had undergone no other change - -
I learnt from this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that
the loss of weight was greater
than the increase & that the
salt evaporated rapidly at the

58
common temperature or that it
gave out Ammonia & thus became
neutralised, to ascertain these
circumstances. 100 grains of salt
were exposed [deletion]to Hydrogen gas[/deletion]
[deletion]under[/deletion]r in a cylinder containing
Atmospheric air under mercury
at a pressure of 27 1/2 in
three days a small quantity
of salt was observed on the
top & sides of the cylinder
Mem[superscript]m[/superscript]: the expt in the torricellian
vacuum; but 50 gains of
the salt which were analyzed
contained, their just proportion
of carbonic acid : & the volume
of the air remained the same

[page]61|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00061|dnp20b059pp|62576511[/page]
59
being accounted for
50 [insertion]powdered[/insertion] grains of the salt were now exposed
of carbonic acid, the thermometer standing
at 62 & the Barometer at 30,3
a diminution slowly took place &
in absorbtion of 10 1/2 took place in
half an hour. the salt was rather
whiter than before & had lost in
a great measure its alkaline
smell.
50 grains of the salt were now
exposed to [deletion]Alkaline[/deletion] 6 cubic inches of
ammonia a rapid absorbtion took
place, the whole was absorbed, the
temperature of the mercury
confining the gas was gradually
raised to 160.[superscript]o[/superscript] the ammoniacal
gas was increased to 10 1/2 for a
few minutes no contraction or
expansion was perceived, then an
expansion took place with considerable

60
rapidity. the cylinder was filled
with air, a small quantity of
this air was admitted into
another cylinder & sufficient to cool
a contraction of 2 took place
& white clouds were formed -
the remaining air was ammonia
These exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] appeared contradictory, the
absorption of ammonia in the cold
was a fact that I was unable
to account for, the salt appeared
to contain already a large portion
of superabundant ammonia. [deletion]A[/deletion]
To ascertain the changes effected in
the salt by its exposure to the
atmosphere, the following exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was
made. 100 grains of carbonate were
finely powdered & exposed under mercury
to, 30,50, 50, grain measures of Carbonic
acid, in about an hour there was

[page]63|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00063|dnp20b061pp|62576513[/page]
61
an absorption of 300 grains, the
absorbtion continued to go on
rapidly for some hours, then more
slowly, in 48 hours, the diminution
was to 2008 grains - the 100 grains
of salt were collected they had
altogether lost their alkaline smell
the small pieces were perfectly whitened
externally & viewed thro' the microscope
had evidently chrystalised, it was impossible
to ascertain exactly the increase of
weight gained by this salt as it
was blackened by the mercury
& had small particles mingled with
it no water was deposited on the
side of the [deletion]tube[/deletion] cylinder, 50 grains
were analised in the mode just
described they [deletion]had gained[/deletion] now contained
51 p[superscript]r[/superscript] cent carbonic acid, their quantity
of water of chrystalisation appeared to
be increased - The changes effected

100 grains of carbonate of Ammonia

were exposed to 43 cubic inches
of carbonic acid on the top of

was filled with carbonic [deletion]acid[/deletion]
they were suffered to remain
there for some time, in about 12
hours on diminuation of [unclear]25[/unclear] cubic
inches was perceived, in [underline]about[/underline], 2
days, but 3 cubic inches of carbonic
acid remained, the salt had
acquired all the properties that depend
on acidification, it was now analised
in the mode before adopted, & appeared
to contain -

63
NB in these analysis, there are
the following circumstances to be considered
1. the bulk of the gas at a given temperature
which being given its weight is also given
2. the difference between the weight
of the gas & the weight lost by the
carbonate of Ammonia & lime
this difference is water saturated
with ammonia, which water being
dissolved by the ammonia at a high
temperature is thrown down [deletion]again[/deletion]
when thrown down it dissolves
ammonia, to know the quantity
of ammonia & water in this we
may make use of the following
formula. it was first essential
to determine, the quantity of ammonia
condensed by a known quality of
distilled water & its diminuation
of density the specific gravity of
compleatly caustic spirit of ammonia
is

[page]66|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00066|dnp20b064pp|62576516[/page]
64
30 grains of water must be saturated
with ammonia, the quantity of
ammonia dissolved marked, the
specific gravity of spirit of Ammonia
is known, the weight of this is
known. then [deletion]Amon[/deletion] the deficiency
of weight must be divided in
proportion to the quantity of ammonia
& water in a solution of caustic
Ammonia.

[page]67|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00067|dnp20b065pp|62576517[/page]
65
From these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] it is evident that
there exist many varieties of carbonate
of Ammonia, the common carbonate
of Ammonia of commerce is not
saturated with Carbonic acid &
is even capable of combining with
a larger quantity of ammonia,
To ascertain whether slight differences
of temperature would produce any
differences in the quantities of carbonic
acid & Ammonia entering into combination
the following exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were made
1500 grain measures of Ammonia
obtained from the decomposition
of Sulphate of Ammonia by Lime
which had been passed thro Carbonate
of potash to deprive it of its moisture
was mingled with 500 grains of carbonic
acid under mercury - A diminution
took place & about 320 grains measures
remained - this proved to be pure
Ammonia temperature in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was 63
Barometer 30,6

[deletion]3[/deletion] 2010 grain measures of
Ammonia were now [deletion]exposed[/deletion] confined
in a cylinder under mercury
& 500 of Carbonic acid, the temperature
of the mercury was raised 110
which is the greatest heat in
which I could bear my hands
a rapid diminution had evidently
taken place when the [deletion]mercury[/deletion]
[deletion]was[/deletion] cylinder was removed no farther
absorbtion took place about
300 grams remained which
were ammonia. -
These exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] were repeated with
the same results. -
The difficulties which occur in making
them are that both ammonia &
carbonic acid in the production
generally carry over water which
is deposited, it is difficult to

[page]69|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00069|dnp20b067pp|62576519[/page]
67
free your mercury perfectly from water.
The mercury was generally carefully
cleaned before it was used &
heated to evaporate the moisture.
With great difficulty, I mingled

the gas was removed from the

& white clouds were formed, when
the condensation was compleat, there
remained about 2 1/2 of carbonic

carbonic acid & Ammonia combine
at high temperature & still retain
the aeriform state. -

The first step towards these laws will
be the decomposition of these
bodies which are at present
undecomposed. & the & probably
no class of substances will throw
greater light on this than
the Ammoniacal salts & it
is astonishing that since the
decomposition of Ammonia in
the Nitrate of Ammonia by
Berthollet no attempts should
have been made to decompose
the other Acids in these salts.
From the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that follow
it will appear that all
the Ammoniacal salts undergo
great changes by heat & that
in many of them at high
temperatures the Ammonia &
carbonic Acid mutually decompose each

The brilliant discoveries which have
enriched Chemical science in these [unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear]
days have perhaps induced the philosophers
who made them to conclude too hastily
that the science was arrived at
perfection, a number of brilliant
discoveries have been made & on certain
points there has advanced with
certainty of truth.
But when we consider our inability
to calculate results, an ignorance
of the attractions that bind many
principles together & of the composition
of organic matter, we shall find
that the field of Nature is yet
but little explored & that the most
sublime & most important part
of Chemistry is as yet unkown
The chemical discoveries that have made
& the theory as far as it has been
pushed has extended to simply classing

In the beginning of March

more that of pressure on the

this gradually diminished & was
succeeded, by a thrilling in the

general pleasurable feeling seemed
to absorb existence, ideas were
more rapidly associated together
& at last an irresistible
propensity to muscular action
was indulged in, I recollect
but faintly what happened
I know that my muscular actions
were strong and rapid.-
These astonishing effects very soon
ceased in ten minutes I had
recovered my former state, the
recollections of them were so
imperfect that I had some difficulty

between each. The feelings
at the time were less pleasant
than I generally experienced
them; indeed the gas was
impure & breathed too soon
after its production it contained
some suspended N Acid vapor
& stimulated the lungs so as

neither to increase or diminish

Between April & [deletion]May[/deletion] June. I
constantly breathed the gas sometimes
three or four times a day for
a week at other times, four

the general effects of it
were [deletion]apparently[/deletion] I can describe

[underline]of constant desire of action; but[/underline]
these phaenomena probably depended
more on a wish to carry
on experimental investigation
much interesting me than on
the small quantities of air
inspired - My appetite was
the same as usual & my
pulse not altered - for some
time after the inspiration of
the gas there was generally
a sort of mental indolence
produced probably by the
pleasurable feeling [insertion]connected with [unclear]nowant[/unclear][/insertion], During the

During the last three months
in which I occasionally breathed

wrote down the following account
of the experiment. - "The feelings

are now vanished except
a certain soreness in one

[deletion]these feelings went off very soon[/deletion]
[deletion]After[/deletion] In 2 minutes these likewise disappeared
From this experiment I was almost
inclined to believe that my newly
acquired health had diminished my
susceptibility to the effects of the
gas. - About ten days after
however I had an opportunity
of proving the fallacy of this
supposition

any of the numerous trials that
I made on myself with the gas
yet still I was not satisifed
that it was analogous to
stimulants in general. -
There was no instance in which
excitement had been carried
to that extent in which
it is uniformly accompanied
by exhaustion under the agency
of other powers. -
[Horizontal rule]
Two modes of ascertaining
its specific agency occurred. -
the first by exhausting the
system by excessive stimulation
NB in some experiments acuteness of hearing
was distinct -

The first of these experiments
was made on Dec 23
I drank a bottle of wine as
fast as possible that it might
produce its full effects. - They were
compleat intoxication; they were

Observations on the philosophy of Heat
and Light. -
- by H. Davy. -
At the time of the publication of my essays
on Light & Heat I was a very young
experimenter; from my situation
unacquainted with a number of
important works on those abstruse
subjects
Since that time my knowledge of
facts has increased [deletion]& my scepticism[/deletion]
[deletion]with regard to th[/deletion] & this knowledge
of facts has produced in me a
scepticism with regard to the theories
of light & Heat in general but
in spite of this scepticism the
Theory I have heretofore adopted
appears to me still the most
probable. -

1 Bodies under certain circumstances [insertion]without being altered in their visible appearance or weight[/insertion] become
expanded & when expanded possess the
property of communicating expansion to other
bodies & of themselves become contracted.
2 There are a few solitary instances
in which bodies become expanded themselves
whilst they communicate expansion to
other bodies, ice, iron &c.
3. When bodies possess the powers of
expanding others to a very great extent
they are generally luminous ie
they throw off rays of light in
all directions
4. In the combinations of
bodies, the bodies often become
contracted & then they generally expand
the bodies in contact with them. -
5 When this expansion is very
great they produce as in the
other cases light
6. In many decompositions &

141
combinations a power to expand other
bodies is connected with a very
great expansion of the bodies themselves.
7 The expansion of organ - is the
sensation we call Heat
8 Bodies expand in all dimensions without
being materially altered in their properties
till they become fluid, aeriform
& so on, the they are very
much altered. -
Two conclusions; must follow from
the phaenomena of expansion -
1. When a body expands its particles
must move from each other -
2 After expansion the attractive
forces of the particles for each other
 must be less than before –

[page]146|MS-DAVY-12002-000-00146|dnp20b142pp|62576596[/page]
142
The great question to be determined is
whether this motion of particles
from each other & the consiquent
diminution of Attraction is a
phaenomenon depending upon
the simple communication of motion
or whether it is effected by
the agency of a peculiar substance
having affinity for all bodies &
which either chemically combines with
their particles or insinuates itself between
them so as to produce their
seperation.
[deletion]The [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] The facts in favor of the
1 first hypothesis are [unclear]yet[/unclear] that bodies
can be expanded by friction without
being in contact with bodies
capable of communicating heat

my experiments in the west country contributions. -

them altogether. It is more laborious
to accumulate facts than to reason

About 20 months ago I began the
study of Chemistry. The system of
Lavoisier [deletion]only t[/deletion] almost the only
elementary book in my possession
was the first that I studied
In that system, an imaginary
being called Caloric engaged my
attention. I considered that He had
too much neglected light, & this
great source of our sensations engaged
my attention, to ascertain a universal
concomitance between what is called
sensible heat or heat of temperature
& light first engaged my attention

Yet in [deletion]my[/deletion] reviewing my Theory
I find [deletion]but[/deletion] reasons for relinquishing
but a very small part of it.
Prejudice, & ignorance her eternal
concomitant may for awile arrest
the progress of the human mind.
The criticisms of Closet chemists
may influence the world, men
Who never made [insertion]an[/insertion] expt themselves
may sit in judgement on the
labor. The the man who devotes
his life to the interest of
Science & of mankind may be
neglected & persecuted. - It
is not in the power of error
to destroy truth. - I would
always wish for that existened
of a certain portion of scepticism

No one will deny the existence of
motion no one will deny that
expansion is the only measure of heat
The expansion if you allow the
existence of particles they must
move or separate from each other
The phenomenon of the condensation of
fluids & gases producing what
is called increased temperature
is another fact unconnected
with expansion & requires to
be differently reasoned upon.
I was perhaps wrong in publishing
with such haste a new Theory of
Chemistry & my mind was ardent
& enthusiastic. I believed I had
discovered the truth, since that
time my knowledge of facts is
increased, since that time I
have become more sceptical

These critics perhaps do not understand
that these experiments were made at a
time when I had studied Chemistry
but four months, when I had never
seen a single experiment executed
+ & when all my chemical information
was derived from Nicholson's Chemistry
& Lavoisiers elements. They do not
perhaps consider that my apparatus
could not be made more perfect
& that infinite labour was required
in performing every exp[superscript]t[/superscript] they have
asserted that their inaccuracies have
been determined by some eminent
chemists, who are these eminent
chemists there are few enough
God knows in England. They were
often repeated & they will in
general be found to be accurate
 In a system, much criticism I despise

The experiments which I have before

that at this temperature the Hydrogen

the carbonic acid by its attraction
for oxygen, I endeavored to ascertain
this in the following manner -
50 grains of the Alkaline Carbonate
of ammonia were decomposed by diluted
sulphuric acid & gave 23 grains Carbonic

Introduction. Man was long before he discovered the
true connexion of cause & effect. Science & civilization
[unclear]more[/unclear] from his wants the objects of which tho' originally
near became gradually more remote. The invention
of language gave him a class of regularly associated
ideas. which enabled him to perceive similarly
to other men at nearly the same time.
It is this language which raised him from
the savage state which enabled him to volutarily
to call up ideas & passions & to employ them
for the purpose of gaining new sensations.
The discovery of the use of permanent signs
which should raise similar ideas in the
minds of all individuals is writing whether
Hieroglyphic or Alphabetic was the next
important step by this art the labor [deletion]of[/deletion] &
Genius of the individual no longer died
with him or only extended to his contemporaries
existing in characters it became immortal
Hence inventions were accumulated this
then profited by the labor of the philosopher
who lived before him & laid a foundation
from which a future age was to erect

impressions cannot be so well called part of
self as they are variable & infinitely different
except those words I, self myself eye nose
&c. which are connected often with our
impressions & ideas, The sensations we call
self [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] are petually [insertion][unclear]rpetualy[/unclear][/insertion] occuring & are more or
or less connected with all our other trains
of ideas & sensations, the greater number of our

tangible & visible which we call self'.
from this analysis we find the absurdity
of what has been called conciousness of
existence, of Descartes axiom. I think therefore
I exist. Of Hartleys beginning. of Darwins

[deletion][unclear]Morality or the xxxxxxx which teaches[/unclear][/deletion]
The power of regulating our actions must
be deduced from experience - those actions
are in fact the result of our [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] own ideas
our passions & present sensations.
Morality is a science which teaches us
rightly to associate pleasure & pain with
our ideas - we find almost perpetualy
in metaphysical books allusions to mind
as the being in which sensations ideas
&c exist, they ought first to have
defined the word mind is it an idea
or a pleasure or pain or a sensation
I do not find that it is either of
these it must then be a word
expressing either all our sensations ideas
pleasures & pains or some of them
We will just consider what is the
true meaning of the word self. -

The lights thrown upon physiology by the
discoveries in the physical Sciences instead
of showing to the [unclear]Gr.[/unclear] new paths for the
pursuit of experimental science have
heretofore been more the subject of speculation
The cure of diseases by the application of air
to the lungs is altogether founded on
the modern discoveries in Chemistry. -
The importance of respiration to life
& of an atmosphere of a peculiar constitution
to Health. are facts which have never
escaped the observation of Mankind in
general - but the peculiar changes effected
in the system by respiration in spite of
the light thrown upon them by Chemistry are not
so well understood - Very simple experiments
prove that the bodies called combustible are
only capable of inflammation when in contact
with air of a peculiar kind which from
its property of supporting life has been called
Vital air. in the process of combustion
the combustible body & the vital air
disappear, with great Heat & the liberation
of light whilst a new substance is formed
with properties essentially different from the
substances forming it -
