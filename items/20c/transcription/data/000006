very little [?in] agitation most probably it
was hydrogene Nitrous acid appeared a
very bad conductor

[Horizontal rule]
In the solution of Ammoniac the oxygene
wire 2 2/3 the hydrogene 15. 1/2 the gold
very much corroded & something like
yellow deposit upon it in the oxygene wire
the oxygene wire gas was composed
of 1 2/3 oxygene. This gas residual
did not inflame with oxygene was
not absorbable by water & â€˜as there
is every reason to beleive was
cheifly composed of Nitrogene

[Horizontal rule]
on boiling twice a strong solution
of caustic Ammoniac I obtained
x from it nearly 1/20 of its bulk

of air which was apparently Nitrogene
during the whole process air bubbles
rose

[Horizontal rule]
diluted Nitric acid poured upon the gold
produced no change; but when
concentrated [deletion]Nitric aci[/deletion] muriatic acid was
employed gas was given out the matter
was dissolved & the gas did not diminish
with Nitrous gas -
