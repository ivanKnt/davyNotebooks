Sulphate of iron in solution impregnated
with Nitrous gas I have found the best conductor

[Horizontal rule]
When impregnated sol[superscript]n[/superscript] of sulphate of
iron was used no gas was given out
from either wire â€“ 

[Horizontal rule]
When muriatic acid of commerce was
used no gas was given out & the
Silver wire gave clouds -
When pure muriatic acid was used
hydrogene was apparently given out
from the silver wire whilst a globule
of gas only was disengaged from 

the zinc wire. -

The gas from the hydrogene wire
of Ammoniac [?x] to 3 with 1
of Nitrous gas gave no diminution

[Horizontal rule]
When muriatic acid was put
in contact with the hydrogene wire
& Ammoniac with the oxygene wire
gas was given out from both about
six times as much from the oxygene
as from the hydrogene.
