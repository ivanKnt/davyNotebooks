the three of gas from the hydrogene wire
in Ammoniac with 1 1/2 of oxygene left
rather more nitrogene than prexisted in
it but not more than 1/2 1/12 or 1/13
of the whole quantity. -

a quarter of a cubic inch of gas

The hydrogene from the muriatic acid inflamed
with oxygene gave great diminution

[Horizontal rule]
When the galvanic influence was
passed through muriatic acid in two
separate vessels gas was given 
out in the hydrogene; but none
from the oxygene wire, the gas from
the hydrogene wire was apparently partially
absorbed, when suffered to [?rest] about 1/4 of
it. â€“
