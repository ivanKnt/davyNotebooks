the oxygene wire & 4 nearly from
the hydrogene wire

[Horizontal rule]
these 4 with two of oxygene left
nearly 2 which gave no diminution
with Nitrous gas & were not absorbed
by water . The electric spark
passed through them with
two of oxygene left rather more
than two. -

The circumstance that most struck me on
the perusal of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Nicholsons account
of his curious exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] & those of M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Carlisle on the decomposition of water
X by means of the galvanic influence,
was the apparent fixation of oxygene
[deletion]at the point of an oxydable wire[/deletion]
at the point of one wire & the
production of hydrogene from the
other the intermediate distance
being very great.- It was difficult supposing
the water decompounded at one point
to suppose that one of the elements
of it could be carried through
water in a condensed & invisible
state

sulphurated by hydrogene.-
