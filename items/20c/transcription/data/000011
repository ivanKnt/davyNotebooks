- Observations on Galvanism - 
In perusing M[superscript]r[/superscript] Nicholsons account of
his curious experiments & those of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Carlisle
on the decomposition of water by means of
the galvanic battery of Volta I was particularly
struck with the phenomenon of the fixation
of the oxygene at the point of one wire
[deletion]whilst[/deletion] & the [insertion]extraction of the[/insertion] hydrogene [deletion]was given out at[/deletion]
[deletion]the[/deletion] round the surface of the other the
intermediate distance being nearly two
inches. [deletion]In[/deletion] Whilst pursuing a
course of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with a view of collecting
facts which might lead to an explanation
of this phaenomena I have [deletion]met with[/deletion] made
some new observations
