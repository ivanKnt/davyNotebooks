Sir
In pursuing a course of experiments
on the Galvanic influence I have been
able to make some new observations
which as they are connected with
the [deletion]valuab[/deletion] curious facts detailed by
yourself & others in the last numbers
of your journal I [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] request you to
communicate [deletion]them[/deletion] to [deletion]the public[/deletion] [insertion]Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/insertion] through
the medium of that valuable publication.

[Horizontal rule]
The apparatus that I employed was
constructed at the request of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes
& consisted of 118 sets of Zinc & silver.-
I found the galvanic shock very much
increased when the parts through which
it passed were moistened with solution
of green sulphate of iron. A pile
erected with pieces of cloth wetted
[deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] this substance acted for a short
time much more powerfully than a
similar pile erected [deletion]with cloth soaked[/deletion] [insertion]in the usual mode[/insertion]
[deletion]in solution of salt, it rapidly however[/deletion]

[deletion]lost its powers in consequence of[/deletion]
[deletion]the decomposition of the sulphate of[/deletion]
[deletion]iron by the oxide of zinc[/deletion]
it seemed however to lose its powers
in a shorter time perhaps the solution

of sulphate of Zinc or other metallic
