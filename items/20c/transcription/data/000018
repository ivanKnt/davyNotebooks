muscular fibre, I introduced into one
glass a piece of silver wire &holding
the upper part of it in my dry right

hand no gas was given out in either
glass & the silver wire rapidly
calcined - when my right hand

This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] is the most extraordinary
of any that have occurred to
me &c
