[deletion]In these From the results of these experiments[/deletion]

[deletion]it seems most probable[/deletion]
In the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the sulfuric acid & Nitric
acid it is most probable that the
acids were decomposed by the combination
of their oxygene with nascent hydrogene
given out in the silver tube-
In the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the muriatic acid &
Ammoniac the gold in [insertion]the[/insertion] Zinc tube was
most probably oxydated in consequence
of [deletion]what may be called[/deletion] predisposing affinity
none of the compound bodies appear to
have been immediately decomposed in consequence
by the galvanic influence - The difference
in [deletion]my ex[/deletion] the results of my exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] & those M[superscript]r[/superscript] Henry may be accounted for from
the different modes in which we operate
I suspect however [deletion]that if[/deletion] that ingenious
chemist [deletion]will compare[/deletion] [insertion]on [?re] repeating[/insertion] his exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
[deletion]solution[/deletion] solution of potash under new
circumstances [deletion]He[/deletion] will find reasons for
altering his conclusions with regard to
the decomposition of potash by the galvanic
influence
[X]probably phosphoric acid [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] & other acids
dissolved in water may be decomposed [insertion]when[/insertion] exposed
to the nascent hydrogene extricated under
the galvanic influence, [deletion]it is probl[/deletion]
If as is probable the quantity of [?Zydrogene]
