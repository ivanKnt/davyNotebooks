Observations on the Nitric acid.
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley long ago observed that the substances
distinguished in the modern chemical nomenclature
by the names Nitric & Nitrous acids were
capable of [deletion]exi[/deletion] being exhibited in the [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] aëriform
state. The most elegant & convenient way
of producing aëriform nitrous acid is by
throwing into an exhausted balloon about
two parts of Nitrous gas & one part
of oxygene gas. in this [deletion]case[/deletion] [insertion]exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/insertion] a great
diminution of volume takes place & [deletion]the[/deletion]
[insertion]increase of temperature is observed &[/insertion] an orange gas is formed which
remains permanently aëriform at the 
temperatures of the atmosphere.
The affinity of Nitric acid in the aëriform
state for Nitrous gas is so great
that altho as superabundance of oxygene
gas [insertion]much[/insertion] more than sufficient to saturate
the Nitrous gas is thrown into the globe
yet stile it retains its yellow color &
when condensed by water is evidently
more or less phlogisticated.
‘Indeed Nitric acid itself may be considered
rather as a binary compound of Nitrous gas &
oxygen gas than as a binary compound
of Nitrogine & oxygene and as aeriform
Nitrous gas has a very strong affinity for
Nitrous & holds it in solution so aeriform
