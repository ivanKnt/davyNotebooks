Water diminishes in specific gravity in 
proportion as its temp[superscript]e[/superscript] is higher
so do the Nitric acids -
100 parts of [?[deletion]pale[/deletion]] Nitrous acid of 1.144
at temperature 65° contains rather more
than 25 1/2 of Nitrous acid of specific
gravity 146 which is nearly the common
specific gravity of the acid of commerce.
And as [deletion]it is[/deletion] [?[deletion]part[/deletion]] concentrated Nitric
acids expand more on increase
of temp[superscript]e[/superscript] than diluted ones supposing
the temperature about 90° it would
follow that 100 parts of acid of
1.144 contains near 26 of acid of
1.46. consequently an ounce of
this acid would equal [deletion]nearly[/deletion] rather
more than two drachons by weight
