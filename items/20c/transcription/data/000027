aeriform Nitrous acid. -
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley long ago observed that Nitrous acid was [?capaflable]
of being existed in the aeriform state when deprived
by heat of a certain portion of the water that
adheres to it in the fluid form & placed
out of the contact of bodies [deletion]in[/deletion]capable of
decomposing or absorbing it. -
The most elegant & convenient mode of procuring
Nitrous acid gas is by the introduction of
Nitrous gas & oxygene gas nearly in the proportion
of 2 to 1 into an exhausted glass balloon
furnished with a glass stop cock. In this
case* a great contraction of volume in
the gases takes place increase of temperature
is produced & an orange colored or deep
red aëriform fluid generated which remains
permanently aëriform at [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] all known
temperatures. –
