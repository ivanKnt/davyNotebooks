The importance of the knowledge of the constitution &
use of the atmosphere has been too often insisted

upon by philosophers to need any new exhibitions
that the body of elastic fluids surrounding the
earth capable of ballancing a body of mercury
equal to 30 inches in height is cheifly constituted
as far as chemical instruments have been able
to reach of two elastic fluids oxygene gas
or pure air & Nitrogene gas in phlogisticated

air have been fully demonstrated by the researches

of Priestley, Lavoisier & others -
But whether these bodies are bound together
by [deletion]a[/deletion] a chemical affinity or whether they are
kept in mechanical mixture from the motions
of the Atmosphere has not been clearly determined
[deletion]Of the experiments[/deletion] Bodies of different specific
gravities may continue so as to form a compound
nearly of the [deletion]same[/deletion] mean specific gravity this
is the case in the mixture of many
of the weaker acids with water & in
the combinations of many of the more diluted
acids with water Hence [underline]A[/underline]tmospheric air though
nearly of the spec: gravity of a mixture of

oxygene & Nitrogene many still be a chemical 

mixture amongst the most decisive of the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
which I have invented for the purpose of ascertaining
whether Atmospheric air is a compound is the
solubility of Atmospheric air in water & other
fluids as compared with the solubility of its
