in contact with Carbonic acid. [Two ink sketches]

[Horizontal rule]
In the exhausted receiver little or no
oxydation of the Zinc plates was produced
quere was this in consequence of the
abstraction of oxygene of atmospheric air
or was it in consequence of the non
conducting electricity of vacuum.-
Quere would the [deletion]spark[/deletion] [insertion]effect[/insertion] be produced in
[deletion]vacu[/deletion] carbonic acid. - no acid is
apparently present when the effect
is produced in distilled water.
Charcoal when long exposed to a great heat
becomes a perfect conductor of electricity quere
will it conduct galvanism & if so [deletion]enable[/deletion]
will it be enabled by means of it to decompose water
- [?Modo] of preserving water from the
contact of atmospheric air by covering
it with oil. - Quere will the
affinity of water for air enable it
to combine with air dissolved in
oil mem to try this -
Mem to put the water or the
inside of the exhausted receiver
& the galvanic pile on the outside
Charcoal seems to be a better
conductor [deletion]than[/deletion] when heated red than
when [deletion]white[/deletion] cold
