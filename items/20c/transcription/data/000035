on introducing [deletion]on[/deletion] to [?[deletion]this[/deletion]] the remainder
lime water a considerable & rapid absorption
took place at first & afterwards a slighter
absorption with cloudiness. – 
the whole quantity of gas remaining after
this absorption was equal to 1/7 of the
whole quantity. -

This [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] 1/7 was cheifly oxygene.-

[Horizontal rule]
The air given out from the oxygene
side was not equal to 1/40 of that from
hydrogene side - this air was
not absorbed by lime water & mingled
with a bubble of nitrous air equal
to about twice its bulk gave such
a diminution as directed it to
be common air –

[Horizontal rule]
2 The silver wire of the hydrogene side in
ammoniac produced three measures [insertion]& 2[/insertion]3 of gas
ie E M by silver.- This gas detonated
with oxygene proved to be hydrogene
nearly pure - of [deletion]Nitrogene[/deletion] gas from
1/6 of a measure was produced
the oxygene side was produced. – 
when the electric spark was passed
thro this mingled with 10 of oxygene
no [deletion]percepti[/deletion] inflammation took place
