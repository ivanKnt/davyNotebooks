That [insertion]well burnt[/insertion] charcoal is a conductor of the [insertion]common influence[/insertion] galvanic
has long been known the following experiments
[deletion]upon its[/deletion] will prove that it is
possessed of powers similar to [insertion]those of the[/insertion] the metals
[deletion]of produci[/deletion] in producing the galvanic
shock & in decomposing water when
made part of the [deletion]galvanic circle[/deletion]. -
when made the medium of communication
The earlier experimenters in galvanism discovered
that charcoal possessed in common with the
metals the power of conducting & exciting
that influence, [deletion]in making some experiments[/deletion]
[deletion]on this substance with the new galvanic[/deletion]
[deletion]pile I have met with some facts which[/deletion]
[deletion]appear to me worthy of detail in[/deletion]

[deletion]laying the foundation serving as bases[/deletion]
[deletion]for interesting researches.-[/deletion]
I have found that this substance conducts
the electricity of the new galvanic
pile [underline]nearly[/underline] as well as the meta
ls. -
When two pieces of well burnt charcoal
are connected [deletion]with[/deletion] separately with
the Zinc & silver ends of the machine
[insertion]when they are touched by the hands[/insertion] the shock is transmitted [deletion]through them[/deletion]
by means of them through the human
body
