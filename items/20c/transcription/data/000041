If they are made to compleat the

circle by touching each other provided

the [deletion]electr[/deletion] pile be powerful to produce

sparks by means of metals

The earlier exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] in [deletion]galvanism[/deletion] [insertion]Animal electricity[/insertion] discovered

that well burnt charcoal was a conductor of

the common galvanic influence. [deletion]I have[/deletion]

[deletion]when two pieces of this substance[/deletion]

[deletion]found that this substance[/deletion] [deletion]when perfectly[/deletion]

[deletion]are connected with the ends of the galvanic[/deletion]

[deletion]dry & even when red hot communicates[/deletion]

[deletion]the galvanic shock & produces[/deletion]

[deletion]sparks to the same extent as [/deletion]

[deletion]most of the metals when two pieces [/deletion]

[deletion]of it are made the connectors [/deletion]of

[deletion]the silver & Zinc in the galvanic [/deletion]

[deletion]circle of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Volta.-[/deletion]

In making some experiments on [?xxxxx] [insertion]substance[/insertion]

with the [deletion]galvan[/deletion] new metallic pile

I found that it not only [deletion]produced[/deletion] [insertion]communicated[/insertion]

the shock to the human body when

[deletion]piece[/deletion] pieces of it were made the

[underline]medium of communication[/underline][deletion] between[/deletion]

[deletion]the plus end [/deletion]& minus[deletion] end[/deletion] connected with

the plus & minus ends but likewise

that when these pieces were brought

in contact they produced the spark

with a degree of vividness not inferior

to the metals. -
