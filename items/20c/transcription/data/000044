the charcoal connected with the [deletion]Zinc[/deletion] [insertion]silver[/insertion] side
of the app[superscript]s[/superscript] - A considerable time lapsed
before any air was given out from that
on the silver side, In half an hour however
a few globules had formed about it. -
During the whole of which time gas
was given out rapidly [deletion]from the silver[/deletion]

Reasoning from the common phaenomena of the
action of red hot charcoal on water & on
the analogous galvanic facts it was reasonable
to conclude that [deletion]the gas evolved from the[/deletion]
[insertion]charcoal on the[/insertion] [deletion]silver side of the apparatus was[/deletion] hydrocarbonate
[deletion]was evolved from the charcoal[/deletion] & that [insertion]the carbonic[/insertion] carbonic
acid [deletion]had been[/deletion] produced on the Zinc side
[deletion]which were[/deletion] [insertion]had been[/insertion] cheifly absorbed by the water

To ascertain the truth of the conclusion two
small tubes about 1/4 of an inch in diameter
& three inches long were provided into one end
of each of them tubes [?[deletion]xxxxx[/deletion]] then piece of finely [insertion]hard &[/insertion]
[?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]] polished charcoal was introduced & fastened by
cement: - The tubes were filled with distilled

[insertion]inserted with glass of[/insertion]
water & the charcoal connected with
[deletion]The[/deletion] [?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]] ends of pile. - [insertion]The [?xxxxxx] was continued[/insertion] 
for 14 hours [insertion]when[/insertion] the gas [insertion]produced[/insertion] from silver side was [deletion]equal[/deletion]
in volume 50 times greater than that produced
charcoal of willow can [deletion]be more[/deletion] easily [deletion]cut[/deletion] & polished & reduced
