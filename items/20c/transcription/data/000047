[deletion]The residuum[/deletion] When Nitrous gas & oxygene
gas are mingled over water of any kind
during the absorption of the acid by water
an immense quantity of gas is produced from

the surface of the fluid but this takes place
equally in water that has been just boiled
& in common water, It is not owing to
the disengagement of carbonic acid or
Azote but owing to the disengagement
of Nitrous gas When the [insertion]concentrated[/insertion] acids are
dropped into common water in small
quantities no air is given out
When Nitrous gas & oxygene gas are
mingled over mercury the nitrous acid
formed is partly decomposed & partly
