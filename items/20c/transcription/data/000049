In considering the constitution of atmospheric air
it becomes a [deletion]ques[/deletion] question of considerable importance
whether the light & heat produced during its
decomposition by combustible bodies were combined
with it whether they in a specific manner
belong to oxygene or whether they are found
between the interstices of all elastic fluids. - 
As far as we can reason from analogy
all bodies whatever when combined
with other bodies so as to have their
volume diminished have their power of
gravitation increased. Thus Hydrogene gas
which is 12 times lighter than common
air when condensed in water becomes
800 times heavier. - Supposing then that
any specific fluid is combined in atmospheric
air it follows that it might to gravitate
to ascertain whether it gravitates
sensibly - I made the following exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] -
combustion of phosphorus slow & quick. -
In the phaenomena of combination however
rapid we can discover no law but a
law of approximation, nothing is more
easy than to conceive that during this
approximation the ether between the particles
is pressed out with great velocity
& in proportion to its velocity becomes
heat or light â€“
