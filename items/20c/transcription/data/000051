the results & holding in solution a minute
quantity of carbonic acid & about 1/16 of
Atmospheric air -
When Nitrous gas is exposed to Water
it decomposes the common air of the
water combines with the oxygene of it
to form Nitrous acid the Nitrogene being
liberated - No carbonic acid is given
out during this process for not only
if Nitric acid (concentrated/ be poured
into common water no liberation of
gas is perceived but [underline]likewise if
[/underline]solution of[underline] Strontian & Barytes be
exposed to it no[/underline] precipitation takes

Now if water saturated with Nitrous
gas could be used in water which
has [underline]a slight[/underline] affinity for atmospheric
oxygene, the corrections on account
of the liberated gas would be

[Horizontal rule]
Water holding in solution Nitrous
gas has its power to absorb Nitrous
gas increased in consequence of
its combining oxygene of atmospheric
air into nitrous acid.-
