In Nitrous gas it went on rather 
more slowly that at first in atmospheric
air gradually still more slowly
in about half an hour the
cloud was but barely perceptible -
- few globules of air only came
from the hydrogene wire at intervals
& some small globules of gas collected
round the silver wire at last in 
an hour & quarter it appeared
to stop altogether – 


In hydrocarbonate scarcly any
effect could be perceived ie. the gas

was much smaller in quantity & globules formed
