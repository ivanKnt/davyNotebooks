1 Atmospheric air
3 Azotic gas - scarcely at all
2 Nitrous gas but little
4 Hydrocarbonate scarcely at all
Hydrogene [?8°] – 

[Horizontal rule]

A pile that has acted for half an
hour in Nitrous gas without
having apparently lost [deletion]much[/deletion] [insertion]any[/insertion] power
was introduced t into Nitrogene in
which it [insertion]previously[/insertion] had ceased to act
it immediately began to act again
& continued to act through half an
hour –

[Horizontal rule]
the water in contact with the
piles could not be the cause
of the action, because after the
action had ceased in Nitrogene
& hydrogene it could not be
carried on again by the [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] immersion
in the water of the trough –

[Horizontal rule]
It continued to go on but yet very
slowly in Nitrogene

[Horizontal rule]
After it had ceased in nitrogene
it was immediately restored by agitation
in water
