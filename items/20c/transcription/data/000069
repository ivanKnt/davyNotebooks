Notice of experiments & observations on the
causes of the galvanic phaenomena by
H Davy. -
That the phaenomenon of galvanism dependest upon
certain chemical changes cheifly produced by
the combination of atmospheric oxygene or oxygene
from water with Zinc has long been a favourite
opinion with many philosophers. It [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]first[/insertion] systematic
cally advanced by Fabroni & it is [deletion]defended[/deletion] [insertion]adopted[/insertion]
by Colonel Haldane in his last paper on
galvanic electricity -
Immediately after I had perused an [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] [insertion]observation[/insertion] of
this gentleman on the non excitement of
galvanism in the common vacuum
I began a series of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with a view
of ascertaining with precision the influence
of the atmosphere on these phaenomena
In prosecuting these experiments I have
met with many important facts
which admit of a tolerably perfect
arrangement & which appear to me
to point out the causes of the
[?[deletion]x[/deletion]] galvanic appearances with as much
precision as we can reasonably exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
in so abstruse a subject.- of these
facts [insertion]& of some conclusions[/insertion] without farther introduction
I shall give a short [insertion]& methodical[/insertion] detail without
