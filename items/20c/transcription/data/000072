2. The oxydation of Zinc [insertion]whether it is in contact with other metal or no[/insertion] takes place
whenever it is exposed to water
holding either atmospheric air oxygene
or Nitrous gas Nitrous acid marine
acid &c in solution
a - [deletion]That Zinc oxydates in[/deletion] The common
phaenomena of the oxydation of [deletion]the[/deletion] 
[deletion]calex of Zinc[/deletion] polished Zinc when water
is dropped upon it in the atmosphere
is well known. - the oxydation
of the [deletion]galv[/deletion] Zinc of the galvanic
pile in the atmosphere is likewise
well known -
b. A galvanic pile was exposed for
[insertion]the[/insertion] two hours to oxygene gas at the
end of this time, the oxydation of
the ends of the Zinc plates could
be distinctly seen through the glass
bell in which it was confined
& on examining the plates they
were almost covered on the outside
of the moistened cloth with [deletion]the[/deletion] oxide -
c- I have proved that Zinc becomes

oxydated in Nitrous gas - the plates
the galvanic pile became oxydated &c
d In Nitrous acid muriatic acid
&c
