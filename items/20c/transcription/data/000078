The galvanic pile of Volta does not
act unless the Zinc be perpetully oxydating
& its [deletion]oxydati[/deletion] powers are proportional
to the rapidity & of the oxidation -

or deprived of its influence does not oxydate
intself unless the water it contains
holds some loosely combined air in
solution
