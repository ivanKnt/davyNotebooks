1 The galvanic pile of Volta does not
act [deletion]unless[/deletion] when the communication
between the plates is made by pure
water – 

[Horizontal rule]
1 The galvanic pile does not act 
in vacuo. -
2 I have found that the galvanic pile
[deletion]does n[/deletion] acts in hydrogene, nitrogene
[deletion]&c[/deletion] Nitrous oxide &c only [?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]]
till the atmospheric air held in solution
by the water between its plates is decomposed
It ceases to act in those gases in
about a quarter of an hour; but
it can be made to act again
by immersing it in water holding
atmospheric air in solution -
