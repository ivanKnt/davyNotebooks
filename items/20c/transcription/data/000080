On these [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion]preceding facts[/insertion] I shall not pretend to
speculate, A number of new exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] must
be made before we shall be able to 
[deletion]ascertain arrange our observations[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]generalize; or[/deletion] discover these lawes.
[deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]in consequence of[/insertion] which one quantity of chemical
action [insertion]in the galvanic series[/insertion] [deletion]is capable of exerting[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]exerts[/deletion] generates[/insertion] an influence
capable of increasing all analogous actions
& of producing new similar actions:-
[Marginal note in pencil] A number of new exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] must be made probably
even before we shall be able to ascertain
whether water is decomposed in [deletion]the[/deletion] galvanic
processes. Supposing its decomposition
we must assume that at least one of
its elements is [?[deletion]x[/deletion]] capable of passing
in an unknown & invisible form
through metallic substances or through
water & many â€˜organic bodies - &
such an assumption is incommensurable
with [deletion]none no[/deletion] [insertion]all[/insertion] Known facts. -
[Marginal note in pencil] [deletion]The[/deletion] philosophers [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] the eighteenth century
[deletion]have[/deletion] beheld with wonder solid & fluid
substances assuming new [deletion]forms[/deletion] [insertion]modes[/insertion] of existence
in different gases. [deletion]Those of the ninteenth[/deletion] 

[Marginal note in pencil] [deletion]century are probably destined to behold[/deletion]

[deletion]gases assuming the forms of new unknown[/deletion]

[deletion]ethereal fluids[/deletion]- Do not the new facts
encourage [deletion]the hope[/deletion] us to hope that
in the ninteenth century they will
behold [insertion]even[/insertion] those gases undergoing novel
changes & existing in new forms as ethereal
