The [insertion]3[/insertion] nature of this communication / is [insertion]2[/insertion] incompatible
with / a [insertion]1[/insertion] detail of the opinions prevailing amongst
philosophers respecting the causes of the galvanic
phaenomena: they have been generally supposed
to depend on the different powers of bodies
to conduct electric fluid; Fabbroni is the
first who systematically attempted to prove
that they were chemical effects.
Immediately after I had perused an [insertion]interesting[/insertion] observation of
Lieut Colonel Haldane on the non excitement
of galvanism in a boylean vacuum I began
an investigation with the view of ascertaining
precisely the influence of the atmosphere on
the phaenomena; In carrying on this investigation
I have met with some new facts, which
are capable of arrangement & which
[deletion]appear to[/deletion] will probably lead to a compleat
explanation of the galvanic effects
Of these facts [deletion]&[/deletion] & of some conclusions that may
be drawn from them I shall give a brief
account; [?[deletion]But[/deletion]] I must [insertion]however[/insertion] previously state
that the piles I employed for ascertaining
the influence of factitious airs on the
[deletion]galvanic phaenomena[/deletion] galvanic influence
were [?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]] erected [insertion]horizontaly[/insertion] in the usual mode [insertion]but[/insertion] to
prevent the plates from separating when
in an oblique posture their edges were
cemented together in two or three points
