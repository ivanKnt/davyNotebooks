By pure water is more immediately meant
[deletion]water holding[/deletion] water holding in solution no
free oxygene no atmospheric air & no
acids It has long been known that
[?[deletion]7[/deletion]] metallic bodies do not oxydate in
[deletion]water free from airs[/deletion] [insertion]in such water x x [deletion]this oxydates &c more[/deletion] & included from the atmosphere[/insertion] this I have observed
is particularly the case with regard to
Zinc, It has likewise long been noticed
that [?[deletion]Til[/deletion]] [insertion]in the atmosphere[/insertion] Zinc when in contact with
silver [insertion]forming with it a circuit by means of[/insertion] [deletion]de oxydates itself much more[/deletion]
water oxydates itself more rapidly
than when simply in contact with
water; supposing the more rapid oxydation
to be the effect of a peculiar [deletion]influence[/deletion] [insertion]primary action[/insertion]
[deletion]action[/deletion] between the Zinc & silver it was
reasonable to conclude that Zinc in
single circles with silver & pure water
or at least in the galvanic pile erected
[insertion]with cloths moistened [deletion]with[/deletion] in pure water would be[/insertion] would be enabled to oxydate itself.
[?[deletion]xxxxxxx[/deletion]] That it does not oxydate itself will
appear from the following observations. -
[Ink sketch of a small face in profile] [deletion]A pile[/deletion] a A [insertion]small[/insertion] galvanic pile was erected with
distilled water [insertion]that had been just boiled[/insertion] & introduced into hydrogene having
[insertion]the ends connected[/insertion] After remaining in it for fourteen hours
it was examined the plates of Zinc
were scarcely at all tarnished & no
white oxide had formed upon them
