pretty considerably diminished it [insertion][deletion]air[/deletion][/insertion] to 1/13, & when
the including cylinder was removed gave a 
[deletion]strong[/deletion] [insertion]faint[/insertion] smell of ammoniac, the pile itself
[?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]] exposed to marine acid without being
passed through water gave dense white fumes
In another exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [?[deletion]some[/deletion]] the constitution of air
diminished by a galvanic pile was ascertained
It was found to contain much less
oxygene than common air, the hydrogene
if any existed was too small in quantity
to be ascertained by the inflaming test.-
[deletion]A pile [/deletion][insertion]after[/insertion] [deletion]in Nitrous gas[/deletion] I have noticed
before that [insertion]wetted[/insertion] Zinc placed in contact
with [deletion]water[/deletion] nitrous gas upon mercury slowly
converts it into Nitrous oxide & ammoniac
a [deletion]Z[/deletion] small pile exposed for four days.
to Nitrous gas diminished it 1/4
hence [deletion]first[/deletion] there can be little doubt
but that the same chemical changes
took place-
The formation of [insertion]Nitrous gas[/insertion] ammoniac Nitrous oxide
& ammoniac when solutions of Nitrous
acid are made to act upon Zinc clearly
prove the decomposition of the acid
We have no proofs for the decomposition
of sulphuric & marine acid in the oxydation
of Zinc in solutions of these bodies in water
this phaenomenon must be ref[deletion]f[/deletion]ered to 
the peculiar affinities called predisposing.-
