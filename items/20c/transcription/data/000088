4. The galvanic pile of Signor Volta does not
act when the water between the pairs
of plates is [underline]pure[/underline]. NB the gases were not examined
The word pure is here used in the same
sense as in 1 I have found that the
galvanic pile introduced into [deletion]Nitrogene[/deletion] Hydrogene
[insertion]through common water[/insertion] ceases to [deletion]act[/deletion] [insertion]evolve gas in the tube[/insertion] in about five or six
minutes, ie in the time required to
consume the common air confined in
the water between its plates-
The phaenomenon is exactly the same
in Nitrogene, hydrocarbonate, Nitrous
oxides & I beleive carbonic acid
though my exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on this last was
less often repeated than those [deletion]of[/deletion] on
the other gases - A pile ceases to
act in [?N.H.] &c nearly in
the same time & the action cannot
be restored by admitting fresh gases
of the same kind, it is however as
will be seen in the next immediately
restored by immersing the pile for
a moment in water saturated
with atmospheric air. - I have found
[insertion]by numerous[/insertion] [deletion]The galvanic pile ceases to act in [/deletion][insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]vacuue[/deletion] 
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] [deletion]made in conjuction[/deletion] with the assistance
of my friend, M[superscript]r[/superscript] King, that the galvanic
pile even when its poles are connected
by wires with the atmosphere ceases to
