That the influence of the elastic air
[deletion]could[/deletion] has no independant power is evident
from the uniform & constant restoration
of the powers [insertion]after they had ceased in hydrogene[/insertion] of a pile by
immersion in [deletion]Atmosp[/deletion] water [?[deletion]x[/deletion]] saturated
with atmospheric air - In these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
the piles were plunged for a moment
in the water confining the gas without
NO being brought [insertion]even[/insertion] partially [deletion]or wholly[/deletion]
in contact with the atmosphere
& instantly elevated in the gas again
& it could be [insertion]only to[/insertion] [deletion]the water[/deletion] impregnation
of the water with atmospheric air
that the phaenomenon was owing
because when the pile was plunged
into water saturated with Nitrous
oxide a gas which as I have
proved expels much of the oxygene
from water the power was not
restored. - The oil of turpentine
b A galvanic pile inclosed in a
cylinder containing [insertion]about[/insertion] 35 inches of oxygene
acted much more powerfully than
a similar pile in atmospheric
air. - & the gas was diminished
a After a pile had ceased to act in
hydrogene it was immerged [insertion]for a moment[/insertion] in water
impregnated with marine acid [deletion]it acted[/deletion] 
[deletion]for many[/deletion] after this it acted for
no shock when the ends of a pile were touched
