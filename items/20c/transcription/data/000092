- Conclusions - -
[Marginal note in pencil] Of two phaenomena or of two series
of phaenomena we can only affirm
cause & effect because the one uniformly
precedes the other & because when
the one is modified the other
is likewise modified; but it appears
from all the foregoing facts that
[deletion]the the powers of[/deletion] the galvanic
pile of Volta acts only when
the conducting substance between its
plates is capable of oxydating
the Zinc & that in proportion
as a greater [deletion]proportion[/deletion] [insertion]quantity[/insertion] of oxygene
is combined with the zinc in
a given time so in proportion
[deletion]are[/deletion] is the galvanic power of
the machine to produce water 
[Marginal note in pencil] & to give the shock greater- -
We may therefore affirm that the
fixation of oxygene in the Zinc
in the pile of Volta is the 
cause of the galvanic or electric
effects it produces - I have
not [deletion]been[/deletion] [?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]] [insertion][deletion]yet [?have][/deletion][/insertion]observed so many
phaenomena without forming a
theory of explanation of the part
the silver acts in the process
