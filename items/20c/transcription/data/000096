- General observations-
It is easy in the foregoing principles
to explain why muriate* of soda &
[deletion]muriate of[/deletion] ammonia & sulphate
of iron increase the galvanic
effects. It is likewise easy to explain
the [deletion]great[/deletion] different exciting powers
of metals which will be found nearly
in the ratio of their affinity
for oxygene. -
I cannot close this notice without
observing that [deletion]not only a new [/deletion][insertion]the preceding facts[/insertion] not
[deletion]field is opened[/deletion] only opens a

new field for investigating the
connection between heat and light &
electricity in their ultimate nature
but likewise presents us with
new analogies between the
chemical changes & the organic
functions. - but here speculation will
be vain I may however venture
to predict that the [insertion]properties & powers[/insertion] etherial

fluids will not long remain
unknown to us. â€“ 
i.e. from their predisposing affinity enabling
the Zinc to combine with oxygene -
