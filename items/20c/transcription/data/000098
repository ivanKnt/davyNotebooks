the extreme plates. -- This pile was
introduced into a vessel [insertion]having copper[/insertion] filled
with oxygenated marine acid gas
without being moistened; but no oxydation
of the wires & no disengagement of
gas took place, though the oxygenated
marine gas was supposed to remain
in contact with it for near two
hours. -
The same pile was now moistened by
immersion in water. [insertion][?therefore][/insertion] After it had been
[?wiped] it did not show any signs
of action in the atmosphere; but on
being introduced into oxygenated marine
acid gas the silver were connected with

the greatest rapidity whilst gas was
given out plentifully from the silver
wire.-
