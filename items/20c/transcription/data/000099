seems to prove that the [insertion]cheif use of[/insertion] large surface
water [insertion][deletion]in the[/deletion] increases[/insertion] required is for the oxydation of the
Zinc it appearing from the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] that
the [deletion]slightest[/deletion] smallest quantity of moisture
between the plates is sufficient to
enable the electrical currents to [deletion]pass[/deletion]
form the circuit.- for the contact of
water could not have been in more
than on two points. -
I am at present engaged in endeavoring
to ascertain whether any differences exist
in the gases evolved from water when
the oxydating substances between the
plates are of different composition.-
At a future time I shall probably
offer some observations on the peculiar
affinities which enable iron, Zinc &c
only to decompose water when it
contains atmospheric air [deletion]or[/deletion] acids &c.-
Nothing is more easy than to explain
the use of sulphate of iron, muriate
of soda muriate of Lime &c in
increasing the [deletion]oxydability of the pile[/deletion]
powers of the pile. -
The pile that Chemists will find it
convenient to use for rapid processes
will probably be [deletion]either that I have[/deletion]

X [deletion]pages in my last com[/deletion] page. â€“
