Zinc & probably iron are incapable of oxydating when
the water in contact with them is pure
When the water in contact with them is pure no
galvanic effects are produced. -
Quere can any but a fluid substance an
imperfect conductor of electricity form the medium
of communication between the piles- Qu: muscular
fibre; nitre, manganese. - nitrate of copper. -
Quere will not nitrate of copper with
tin foil & silver make a good.
pile. - Quere is a second
rate conductor necessary between the
piles & must this contain water.-
Quere what will strong sulphuric acid
do.-
Quere
None of the metallic bodies produce
galvanic effects but those which are
capable of combining with oxygene &
water at common temperatures. -
[X] Quere when Zinc & iron & iron & Tin
are combined will both the metals
oxydate or only one.-
[X] The solution of this problem
will lead perhaps to the rationale
