Sulphuric acid very strong enabled a
pile of 11 pairs of Zinc & iron to act -

On Oct.[superscript]r[/superscript] 31[superscript]st[/superscript] .-
I endeavoured to ascertain the influence
of the atmosphere on a pile made
to act by means of sulphuric acid
& nitrous acid -
I found that a pile would not
act at all when sulphuric acid
was poured into the partitions
nor, [underline]I beleive [/underline]when oxyd sulphuric
acid was poured in -
A pile acted with Nitrous acid in
vacuo; but I found it difficult
to bring the gage below - [underline]11/10 v[/underline] - 
It ought to be remembered that
in vacuo, the galvanic phaenomenon
procured when the pile is on the
outside with as much vigor as ever
ie the silver is oxyated
To notice that the communication between
the metals may by made by gold, but
not so the other communication
