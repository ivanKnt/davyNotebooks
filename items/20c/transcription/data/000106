was admitted the silver oxydated more
rapidly than before & no gas was given 
out from either wire; - on wiping
the wire the same results as [deletion]before[/deletion]

obtained in the atmosphere; the
exp[superscript]t[/superscript] repeated in vacuo answered as well
as before - it went in well at 7/10
for half an hour - Two or three days ago
I observed that a pile of copper & zinc
which would not act with the cells
filled with sulphuric acid acted
the moment [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] water [insertion]in drops[/insertion] was introduced
into it. -
[deletion]This process went on for near half

All the galvanic facts uniting to
prove that the oxydation of the
Zinc was the immediate cause 
of the electrical effects &c I began
on Nov[superscript]r[/superscript] 1- To build glasses 
after the manner of Volta in order
that I might observe the 
facts with more accuracy-
Zinc & silver were fastened together by
brass wire & plunged into glasses
in the mode mentioned, sixteen
of these gave a pretty brisk shock
