When muriatic acid was poured into
one of the glasses it acted as usual
upon the Zinc & no hydrogene could
be seen to evolve itself from the silver
some of the brass wires were under water
& some above it . -
Small zinc plates about 1 2/10 long
& 1/4 broad were now introduced
into tubes [deletion]cemen[/deletion] & silver of

the same diameter into other tubes
these were connected in the usual
order. one with a disk of silver
& another with a wire of silver
were made part of the circuit
( hydrogene was immediately given
out from the [deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] wire
[underline]They were suffered[/underline] - to remain all Night
quere will not wires do wholly
for the silver - ?
quere will not glasses with silver
& Zinc connected simply by brass do?
[X] Is Hydrogene attracted by the silver disk
& oxygene by the Zinc disk is it combined
[X] when the disk is compleat & given
x out when it is pointed?

[Horizontal rule]
All the disks forming the circle
