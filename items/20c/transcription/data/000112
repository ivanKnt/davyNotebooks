In physical science the imperfection of our
instruments of investigation; the fallacies to
which we are liable from the modifications
of impressions by the state of feeling & the
[X] minute nature & complicated [deletion]nature[/deletion] [insertion]relations[/insertion] of the
objects of research prevent us from attaining
to that state of certainty afforded by
the results of the science of quantity. -
In proportion as the facts which form the
bases of a science are few, [deletion]so [insertion]&[/insertion] in proportion[/deletion]
[underline]must[/underline] the expressions of those facts simple

so in proportion must the science approach
nearer to certainty: The science of
quantity is nothing more than a connexion
of a few simple expressions of facts
by means of various instruments of language
the formulae of which are simple &
founded on received meanings of words
[/X] In the physical sciences new instruments
of language must be employed in connecting
every new expression of facts: & the science
admits [deletion]only[/deletion] only of partial generalisations
Extending to all impressions & to all
relations of impressions it involves the
universe [deletion]of[/deletion] [?[deletion]its own[/deletion]] : & [deletion]& its subjects[/deletion] man
& nature whether in their simple states 
[deletion]of existence; or in their obvious changes[/deletion] 
[deletion]to[/deletion] [?[deletion]xxx[/deletion]] in all their modifications &
all their newly acquired forms; are [deletion]the[/deletion]
