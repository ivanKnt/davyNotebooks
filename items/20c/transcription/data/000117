The motive power in the galvanic pile appears
to be the oxidation of the Zinc; the silver &
the alternate series of plates & water is essential
both to the evolution of gases from water
& to the negative and positive electricity
but these series must be connected in
a circle. thus silver & Zinc & water
silver Zinc & water [deletion]in[/deletion] & so on in
any ratio in a line appear to produce
no effect th[deletion]r[/deletion]o [deletion]in a[/deletion] [insertion]when in a[/insertion] circle hydrogene
is given out from every surface of
[deletion]Zinc[/deletion] Silver & oxygene [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]fixed on[/insertion] every surface
of Zinc, but the Zinc & Silver form
no galvanic circle when in a line
though when in a circle the medium
of communication is through the whole
of the alternate circles; & wherever
the place of Zinc & silver is
supplied by a [?[deletion]xxxxx xxx xxx[/deletion]]
single arc either of charcoal or 

of metals; hydrogene is evolved from

one side ie the place of the
silver & oxygene fixed & evolved
from the place of the Zinc: this
shows that the process of chemical
action is owing to certain increase
of power ie to certain accumulation
