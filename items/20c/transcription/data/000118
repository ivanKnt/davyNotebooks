of power enabling oxygene to be evolved
where it cannot be fixed in
the alternate circles of gold or platina
Let us now form on hypothesis
Suppose when the Zinc is oxydated it
becomes positively electrified & that in
[X] consequence the silver becomes negatively
electrified & the water is the medium
of connection in the common galvanic
circle; then it is a law of
electricity that light bodies [?[deletion]were[/deletion]] are
are easiest charged with electricity it
consequently follows that the hydrogene
[?[deletion]will[/deletion]] rather than be elicited from the
water will pass to the silver
[X] give out to it is [?xxxxxxxxxxx]
electricity & be eliccited in
the form of gas its equilibrium
being restored â€“ 
Suppose when the Zinc is oxidated it
becomes positively electrified & the silver
negatively in the double circuit then
when a [deletion]compleat[/deletion] line is formed
the water is the medium of connection
then the positive electricity of the Zinc acts
upon the water & produces negative
[deletion]electricity[/deletion] but as it is impossible
that in [?[deletion]a][/deletion] circles separated by water
