can be exactedly restored by [deletion]that excited[/deletion] 
the positive electricity in the plate separated
by water it follows that the plate must
be less electrified than the first

I mentioned in a former paper that the
[deletion]pile[/deletion] series of plates with Nitrous acid acted
much more powerfully than any other combination 
I have since that time tried many of
the metallic combinations with acids
particular difficulties attend those exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on
account of the heat produced & the
rapid evolution of gases - A pile of
ten plates in which the cement was
very high & the bottom of the pile
immersed in water gave strong shocks
Iron & Zinc forming ten pairs did
not give even a sensible shock with 
nitrous acid: though when sulphuric 
acid was poured into them afterwards
they gave a feeble shock. -
X In my expectations to make very powerful
piles with Nitrous acid I h[deletion]ave been[/deletion]
much disappointed
