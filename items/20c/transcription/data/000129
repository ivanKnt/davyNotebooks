one a galvanic circle-

[Horizontal rule]
On this day a [deletion]pile[/deletion] [insertion][?range][/insertion] with wires
set up with all except two
warm water did not act powerfully

they were 24. -
The expected phaenomena were
produced: but very slight it was
difficult to judge of the quantity
of the hydroene produced on account
of the air given out from
the water. - 
Marine acid put into eight produced
but little effect into 24 produced
[deletion]into[/deletion] the other eight the expected
effects - 
Into five of the eight remaining
the mixture of green and red sulphate
of iron [insertion] made by nitrous acid[/insertion] was put; the effects
were most wonderfully increased-
little or no gas was given out from the wires
in the sulphate they became blackish-
the other gave out gas in immense
quantities- 10 of the [deletion]marine[/deletion] caps
were taken away still the action
