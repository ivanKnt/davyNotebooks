That sulphuric acid is not of that order
of [insertion]high[/insertion] galvanic conductors which [insertion]when[/insertion] interposed
between the plates are capable of
destroying the circuit is evident from
the following fact. [insertion]The cells of[/insertion] ten pairs of
plates of copper & zinc constructed with
[deletion]cells[/deletion] by waxen cement [insertion]were[/insertion] filled with an
sulphuric acid of the [deletion]same[/deletion] [?spec] gravity
just noticed: but the range did
not in the slightest degree act.
a [deletion]very minute[/deletion] small drop of water
was then poured upon the acid
in [deletion]the[/deletion][insertion]each[/insertion] of the cells: the pile
immediately began to act & to
effect the usual changes in 
water. -
