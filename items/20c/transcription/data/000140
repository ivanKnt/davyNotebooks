These facts compared with those I
narrated in my last paper sufficiently
warrant the conclusion of the dependance
of the powers of the pile of Volta
on the oxydation of the metals
particularly when we consider that the
most powerful primary galvanic excitors are
those which have most affinity for oxygene.
& that the ratio of power is
proportional to this affinity.
