The first problem that I attempted to solve
was Whether [deletion]in every part of[/deletion] the oxygene
[deletion]of the was fixed in the every part of[/deletion] 
[deletion]the galvanic[/deletion] 
smaller holes were made in

2. A plates of silver & Zinc of 12 inches diameter
were [insertion]at one of their corners[/insertion] fastened by means of a loop wire 

& brass wires were passed through [deletion]these[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]a[/deletion][/insertion] holes
[deletion]so as to fasten together[/deletion] made at the
[deletion]their[/deletion] edge of one of their angles. - 
20 to these were introduced into
glasses filled with spring water so that
the Zinc of the first pair was in the first
glass & the silver in the second & the
Zinc of the second pair in the second glass
[insertion]The brass wires not being suffered to come in contact[/insertion]

& the silver in the third [deletion]&[/deletion] so on after

the manner described by Volta
[deletion]till[/deletion] the circle was compleated by the
Zinc of the last pair being in
the last glass [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] the silver in
the first, [deletion]When the circle was compleated[/deletion] 

[deletion]by the fingers a very faint shock was[/deletion]

[deletion]perceived & when it was compleated by[/deletion]

[deletion]means of a silver wire oxygene was[/deletion]
[deletion]given out[/deletion] When the series [deletion]gave a faint[/deletion]

[deletion]shock when[/deletion] was broken by the removal
of one of the pairs & the fingers introduced
to compleat the circuit a slight shock
was felt when Silver wire was introduced
that part of it in the glass with the
silver of the last pair oxidated
