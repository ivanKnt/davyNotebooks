I now broke the connection between

the four inclosed pairs & distributed them

in different parts of the circle - 
but still the same effects were

produced; [insertion]the large plate gave out no gas while from the small ones it appeared[/insertion] thinking that the globular

figure of the large [insertion]inclosed[/insertion] plate might
influence the result. I inclosed

a polished [?sqare] of silver of 1. 2 inches

diameter in a bottle & connected
it with Zinc in the [insertion]compleat[/insertion] circle I likewise

connected an inclosed [insertion]small[/insertion] circle of silver

of ,3 inches only diameter in the circle
