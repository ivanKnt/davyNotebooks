after a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] [insertion]of[/insertion] which it will
[deletion]would to[/deletion] laborious & unnecessary to
give a minute detail I found
that [deletion]no gas perceptible [?x][/deletion] all the
Zinc plates [deletion]which[/deletion] oxidat[deletion]ed[/deletion]ing in
the galvanic [?circuit] [insertion]with [deletion]common[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]gave out[/deletion] 
[insertion]without giving out any gas[/insertion] [deletion]no[/deletion] perceptible quantity of gas -
that the production of gas from
the silver did not at all depend
upon the form of the plates
but upon the [insertion]measure of [deletion]exposed[/deletion] surface exposed to the water[/insertion] [deletion]quantity of their[/deletion]
surface; [deletion]being[/deletion] the quantity being
in some measure inversely as the
quantity of surface - The large plates
giving out very little gas whilst it
was liberated plentifully from the
smaller ones & that in all exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
with common water the silver
became more or less incrusted.-
2. Considering these singular facts
[X] I could not but conclude that oxygene
was fixed on the Zinc [insertion]in every part of the pile[/insertion] & hydrogene
[deletion]either[/deletion] produced & either condensed [deletion]of[/deletion] or

liberated [insertion]from[/insertion] [deletion]on[/deletion] the surface of the silver
& when I considered the signs of
the presence of Ammonia which I had
perceived when a pile was made
[X] to act in inclosed common air
