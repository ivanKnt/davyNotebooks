3 M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cruikshank who first [deletion]attempted[/deletion] [insertion]noticed[/insertion] to prove
the [insertion]probable[/insertion] formation of ammoniac [deletion]in the comi[/deletion] 
at the [deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] [insertion]silver[/insertion] wire [deletion]of[/deletion] in the well
known exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on the decomposition of
water by the pile has offered some
some ingenious arguements to prove
that Nitrous acid is formed at the Zinc
wire, Reasoning from analogy it would
be reasonable to infer [deletion]that[/deletion] if it
[deletion]existed[/deletion] [insertion]produced[/insertion]in one [deletion]part[/deletion] [insertion]of the series[/insertion] of the oxydating
metallic [deletion]plate[/deletion] it ought to be produced
in all. I have not however
been able to perceive any [insertion]decided[/insertion] change
of color [insertion]to red[/insertion] in [deletion]tincture[/deletion] water tinged with
[deletion]red[/deletion] cabbage juice [deletion]when placed[/deletion] in contact
with the oxydating Zinc plates This however
may possibly be owing to the great
extension of the surface & [insertion]the feeble powers of the pile[/insertion] some facts

indeed have occurred to me which
seem to render doubtful even the
formation of Nitrous acid at the
oxydating pole in the common pile. -
Without attempting to decide the
question which is of much importance
I shall detail these facts . -
a Whenever Nitrous acid [insertion]whether[/insertion] in a concentrated [insertion]or very diluted state[/insertion] state 
is made to act upon iron; it is [deletion]partly[/deletion] [insertion]never[/insertion]
wholly decomposed in oxydating the iron; some of it
