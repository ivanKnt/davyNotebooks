3 Considering the probable formation of 
Ammoniae on all the silver plates
it became a subject of enquiry whether
this formation was connected with
the increase of power of the pile.-
[deletion]& what would be the effect[/deletion] 
To ascertain whether [insertion]wh[/insertion] [deletion]would be the effects[/deletion]
X [deletion]if[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]the surface[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]wires were substituted for discs[/deletion] -
whether diminution of the quantity of 
x surface of silver in the pile would
much diminish its effects. I fastened
some [?[deletion]x[/deletion]] silver wires [deletion]of about[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] 1/20 of
[deletion]an inch in[/deletion] circumference [insertion]& [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] length [?xxxx] [?xx][/insertion] to some
[deletion]polished zinc plates & introducing[/deletion]

some polished Zinc plates & arranging
27 of them in the galvanic
order [insertion]so that alternate of different sizes[/insertion] in glasses filled with

Zinc & silver were distant from each other

At lease an inch or
common water - I was greatly

surprised when I made the communication

by receiving a feeble shock - & when
