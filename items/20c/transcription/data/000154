The circle by a silver wire - I perceived
[deletion]A[/deletion] gas forming & eliciting itself from
the greater number of the wires
It seemed to be given out in larger
quantities where the wires were
shortest in [deletion]some few[/deletion] [insertion]five or six[/insertion] no perceptible
quantity was produced; that [insertion][?some] of the[/insertion] silver
wire supplying the place of the
Zinc seemed to oxydate vividly
& what much surprised me [deletion]white[/deletion]
[deletion]clouds seemed to pull[/deletion] a cloudiness
appeared at the point of other of
the wires giving out hydrogene -
This range of wires was however
soon deranged & I could never
produced [insertion]with simple water[/insertion] another equal to it in
power
A range of 28 Zinc plates & silver
wires gave [deletion]feeble[/deletion] shocks [insertion]but[/insertion] hardly
perceptible to the [insertion]moistened[/insertion] fingers & most
of the wires inserted but a little
way into the water gave out
gas - from the others none was
liberated the cloudiness at the point
of some of the wires could not
be perceived as in the last exp[superscript]t[/superscript]-

poured into each of 16 of the glasses
the Zinc in these glasses began to give
out gas
