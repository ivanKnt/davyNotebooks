Mem[superscript]m[/superscript] the bottle scheme -
the powers of the [deletion]the[/deletion] range were much
increased - gas was disengaged from
the Zinc by the action of the acid
& [?[deletion]x[/deletion]] all the silver wires gave
[deletion]out[/deletion] apparently gave out gas---
A pile in which warm water was
used instead of common water had
its powers of action but very little
increased. [Horizontal rule] & all the wires
not deeply inserted in the water
gave out gas
All there exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] proved that wires were

[insertion]somewhat[/insertion] inferior to [insertion]large[/insertion] disks in common water
[deletion]What[/deletion] To ascertain whether this inferiority
[deletion]depended upon the smaller formation[/deletion]

[deletion]of ammoniac[/deletion] [insertion]condensation of hydrogene[/insertion] or [insertion]upon[/insertion] their [deletion]less[/deletion] [insertion]smaller[/insertion] capacity
for [deletion]electrical influence[/deletion] 
Supposing this inferiority rather to 
depend on their [deletion]less[/deletion] smaller [deletion]powers[/deletion] 
of hydrogene condensed upon their
rather than to their smaller capacities
for the electrical influence it was
reasonable to conclude that their
power [insertion]of [?xxxx][/insertion] would be much increased if
the hydrogene produced upon them
could be condensed in its nascent state
