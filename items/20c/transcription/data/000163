Having set up a powerful circle [insertion]of 27 glasses some [deletion]Zinc[/deletion] with water[/insertion] composed [deletion]of silver[/deletion] [insertion]& some[/insertion]
red sulphate

[deletion] [/deletion][deletion]wire[/deletion] [insertion]with[/insertion] [deletion]some [?glass][/deletion] in which Zinc & silver wire were 
[X]the excitors, I found that when ever I
supplied the place of a pair of plates
either by a single metallic wire or
a chain composed of different metals. -
x whatever were their habits of oxydation
hydrogen was always [deletion]disengaged[/deletion] [insertion]produced[/insertion] in the
place of the silver & oxygene fixed
or extricated at the place of the Zinc. -
When many wires were introduced
into the circle in new places so as
preserve the [deletion]same[/deletion] original number
of exciting plates the powers of it
seemed to be but little diminished
a [deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] [insertion]gas[/insertion] was [deletion]apparently[/deletion] [deletion]produced[/deletion]
x on all the silver wires in the
[X] glasses with common water & on all
the [deletion]silver[/deletion] wires in the place of the
silver.- [insertion][deletion]when those wires of Zinc[/insertion][/deletion] [deletion]Two gold wires connected[/deletion]
Three of these were covered with cement the same changes
[deletion]with[/deletion] [deletion]each of which was introduced[/deletion] 
every where above their points of contact took place -
[deletion]into two tubes filled with water[/deletion]

[deletion][?zinc][/deletion] being at 7/10 the powers of the
whole were not at all diminished
& the silver gave out hydrogene exactly as
