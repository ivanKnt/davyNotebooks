The silver plates were not perfectly polished; this
might have influenced the results & some gas
might have escaped my observation- [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]] That
the operation might go on in closed vessels
I cut off the bottoms of some [deletion]phials[/deletion] [insertion]bottles[/insertion] with
a [deletion]phial[/deletion] so that they could easily be
fastened on again by cement, Into one of
these bottles I introduced a plate of
Polished Zinc & into another a plate
of polished silver . The plates were
[deletion]joined[/deletion] [insertion]connected[/insertion] by a wire att [deletion]one[/deletion] [insertion]ached[/insertion] [?[deletion]xx[/deletion]]to their [insertion]upper[/insertion] angles
which protruded into the atmosphere thro
an orifice made at the [deletion]points[/deletion] [insertion]place[/insertion] of junction
of the [deletion]phials[/deletion] [insertion]bottoms of the phials [deletion]with[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]separated parts of the[/deletion]
[deletion]phials their sides[/deletion] - which were carefully
[deletion]cemented[/deletion] [insertion]fastened[/insertion] to the sides & rendered air
tight by [insertion]chement[/insertion] Four apparatus of this kind pump
were constructed [insertion]filled with water mounted in glasses[/insertion] & made part of a
[insertion][deletion]connected[/deletion] of water in the galvanic order & in[/insertion] [deletion]galvanic[/deletion] series of 20 glasses.-
& made [?fast]
After more than twelve hours the Zinc
plates had become tarnished but had given
out no gas- In two of the
bottles with the silver plates globules of
gas too small to be examined were
collected - The silver plates examined
in the atmosphere were here & there
incrusted with a [insertion]little[/insertion] whitish manner which
of 1.2 inches square this size used in the
