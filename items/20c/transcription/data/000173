[/deletion]In another exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] in which a series with
thirty glasses containing wires & Zinc plates
were used; the wires not only gave
out gas but after some time a few
of them produced a [insertion]film on the[/insertion] slight [insertion]white[/insertion] precipitation
in the water. -

[deletion]Considering[/deletion] [insertion]Speculation[/insertion] these facts [insertion]seemed to show[/insertion] from [deletion]which it appeared[/deletion] 

that the quantity of hydrogene produced was
[insertion]in a series[/insertion] in some measure & to a certain point
in the inverse ratio of the quantity of

Speculating upon them & comparing them
