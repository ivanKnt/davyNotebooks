was [deletion]formed[/deletion] [insertion]produced & on the larger ones almost wholly condensed by the nitrogene[/insertion]on all the silver plates from the
combination of nascent hydrogene with [insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]condensed[/deletion]
Nitrogene [deletion]dissolved[/deletion] of atmospheric air
dissolved in the water ; & this conjecture
was strengthened when I considered the
white [deletion]film[/deletion] [insertion]matter[/insertion] cheifly formed round the silver
at the surface of the water & its
solubility without cloudiness in acids -
which might easily have arisen from the
decomposition of magnesian salts contained
in the pump water [Horizontal rule]
The power of the series with [deletion]Zinc plates[/deletion] &
silver wires was less than that with plates
Supposing the formation of ammoniac it
was probable that the larger quantity
produced upon the plates might be
connected with their greater powers & if
so it was probable that if the
nascent hydrogene was condensed
upon the wires an increase of power
would follow ; This I have found
is actually the case , a [deletion]pile[/deletion] [insertion]series of 13[/insertion] of wires
[deletion]set up with[/deletion] in which the fluid
in the glasses was [insertion]solution[/insertion] red sulphate
of iron mixed with a little [insertion]solution[/insertion] of
common sulphate of iron & Nitrous
gas acted as powerfully as the series
[deletion]of plates[/deletion] of 20 plates & the wires
gave out no hydrogene but occasioned
