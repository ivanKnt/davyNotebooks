         <p>Later known as 'laughing gas'. Davy discovered that nitrous oxide was respirable when
            not contaminated with nitric oxide (NO). Davy researched into the physiological effects
            of nitrous oxide.</p>

         <p>Now known as nitrogen. A colourless and odourless gas, nitrogen is non-combustible
            and non-toxic. Davy also refers to this as azote.</p>

         <p>Unitarian and political radical forced into exile in Pennsylvania. As a natural philospher
            and chemist who retained belief in phlogiston, he discovered oxygen and nitrous oxide
            though not under those names. FRSL.</p>

         <p>English poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, published Lyrical Ballads. Davy contributed
            to seeing the second edition (1800) through the press in Bristol. Poet Laureate from
            1843.</p>
