Sir
In pursuing a course of experiments

which as they are connected with

[deletion]if the wires were of gold[/deletion]
[deletion][chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] was liberated[/deletion]
Knowing from the previous exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that
the living animal was a good conductor
I dipped one [deletion]of[/deletion] of the fingers of the
right hand into one of these vessels
& those of my left hand into
the other, immediately after I received
the shock the [deletion]silver[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_201|[insertion]Zinc[/insertion][/chemical] wire began
to calcine very rapidly & white
[deletion]white[/deletion] clouds fell from it, the silver
[deletion]wires[/deletion] from the silver wire gas was
extricated with great rapidity, this gas
examined after the experiment had continued
for a great length of time proved
to be [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] mingled with a
small quantity of [chemical]chemical_254|common air[/chemical] which
had been previously contained in the

the gas appeared to be disengaged
[deletion]more[/deletion] rapidly when muscular fibre was

Thus [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] was obtained pure from

Observations on the [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical].
[person]person_016|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley[/person] long ago observed that the substances
distinguished in the modern chemical nomenclature
by the names Nitric & Nitrous acids were
capable of [deletion]exi[/deletion] being exibited in the [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] [misc]misc_109|aëriform[/misc]
state. The most elegant & convenient way
of producing [misc]misc_109|aëriform[/misc] nitrous acid is by
throwing into an exhausted balloon about
two parts of [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical] & one part
of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] gas. in this [deletion]case[/deletion] [insertion]exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/insertion] a great
diminution of volume takes place & [deletion]the[/deletion]
[insertion]increase of temperature is observed &[/insertion] an orange colored gas is formed which
remains permanently [misc]misc_109|aëriform[/misc] at the 
temperatures of the atmosphere.
The affinity of [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] in the [misc]misc_109|aëriform[/misc]
state for [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical] is so great
that altho as superabundance of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
gas [insertion]much[/insertion] more than sufficient to saturate
the [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical] is thrown into the globe
yet still it retains its yellow color &
when condensed by water is evidently
more or less phlogisticated.
‘Indeed [chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] itself may be considered
rather as a binary compound of [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical] &
[chemical]chemical_022|oxygen[/chemical] gas than as a binary compound
of [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogine[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] and as [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc]
[chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical] has a very strong affinity for
Nitrous & holds it in solution so [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc]

[chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] has a strong affinity for Nitric
gas there are then in the com[deletion]posi[/deletion]bination of
[chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] many nice affinities concerned
[chemical]chemical_143|Nitric Acid[/chemical] in the [misc]misc_109|aeriform[/misc] state contains
a considerable quantity of water & this
quantity reasoning from analogy must be
greater in proportion as the temp[superscript]e[/superscript]
is higher. -
It has long been considered as a matter
of importance in chemical [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] science
that the quantity of real or true

Water diminishes in specific gravity in

And as [deletion]it is[/deletion] [deletion][unclear]part[/unclear][/deletion] concentrated Nitric
acids expand more on increase

follow that 100 parts of acid of

The importance of the knowledge of the constitution &

upon by philosophers to need any new exhibitions
that the body of elastic fluids surrounding the

as far as chemical instruments have been able

But whether these bodies are bound together

In considering the constitution of atmospheric air
it becomes a [deletion]ques[/deletion] question of considerable importance
whether the light & heat produced during its
decomposition by combustible bodies were combined
with it whether they in a specific manner
belong to [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] or whether they are found
between the interstices of all elastic fluids. - 
As far as we can reason from analogy
all bodies whatever when combined
with other bodies so as to have their
volume diminished have their power of
gravitation increased. Thus [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] gas
which is 12 times lighter than common
air when condensed in water becomes
800 times heavier. - Supposing then that
any specific fluid is combined in atmospheric
air it follows that it ought to gravitate
to ascertain whether it gravitates
sensibly - I made the following exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] -
combustion of [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical] slow & quick. -
In the phaenomena of combination however
rapid we can discover no law but a
law of approximation, nothing is more
easy than to conceive that during this
approximation the ether between the particles
is pressed out with great velocity
& in proportion to its velocity becomes
heat or light –

& it could be [insertion]only to[/insertion] [deletion]the water[/deletion] impregnation

that the phaenomenon was owing
because when the pile was plunged

- Conclusions - -
[Marginal note in pencil] Of two phaenomena or of two series
of phaenomena we can only affirm
cause & effect because the one uniformly
precedes the other & because when
the one is modified the other
is likewise modified; but it appears
from all the foregoing facts that
[deletion]the the powers of[/deletion] the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
pile of [person]person_199|Volta[/person] acts only when
the conducting substance between its
plates is capable of oxydating
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & that in proportion
as a greater [deletion]proportion[/deletion] [insertion]quantity[/insertion] of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
is combined with the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] in
a given time so in proportion
[deletion]are[/deletion] is the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] power of
the machine to produce water 
[Marginal note in pencil] & to give the shock greater- -
We may therefore affirm that the
fixation of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] in the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
in the pile of [person]person_199|Volta[/person] is the 
cause of the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] or electric

it is likewise evident that their

that a pile does not act when
its poles or even its plates are

The motive power in the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] pile appears
to be the oxidation of the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]; the silver &
the alternate series of plates & water is essential
both to the evolution of gases from water
& to the negative and positive electricity
but these series must be connected in
a circle. thus silver & [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & water
silver [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & water [deletion]in[/deletion] & so on in
any ratio in a line appear to produce
no effect th[deletion]r[/deletion]o [deletion]in a[/deletion] [insertion]when in a[/insertion] circle [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]

of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical], but the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & Silver form
no [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] circle when in a line
though when in a circle the medium
of communication is through the whole
of the alternate circles; & wherever
the place of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver is
supplied by a [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
single arc either of [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] or 
of metals; [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] is evolved from
one side ie the place of the
silver & [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] fixed & evolved
from the place of the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]: this
shows that the process of chemical
action is owing to certain increase
of power ie to certain accumulation

[page]118|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00118|000118|000118[/page]

of power enabling [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] to be evolved
where it cannot be fixed in
the alternate circles of gold or [chemical]chemical_028|Platina[/chemical]
Let us now form an hypothesis
Suppose when the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] is oxydated it
becomes positively electrified & that in
[X] consequence the silver becomes negatively
electrified & the water is the medium
of connection in the common [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
circle; then it is a law of
electricity that light bodies [deletion][unclear]were[/unclear][/deletion] are
are easiest charged with electricity it
consequently follows that the [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
[deletion][unclear]will[/unclear][/deletion] rather than be elicited from the
water will pass to the silver
x give out to it is [unclear]superabundnt[/unclear]
electricity & be eliccited in
the form of gas its equilibrium
being restored – 
Suppose when the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] is oxidated it
becomes positively electrified & the silver
negatively in the double circuit then
when a [deletion]compleat[/deletion] line is formed
the water is the medium of connection
then the positive electricity of the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] acts
upon the water & produces negative
[deletion]electricity[/deletion] but as it is impossible
that in [deletion][unclear]a[/unclear][/deletion] circles separated by water

The negative electricity excited [deletion]b[/deletion] in one plate
can be exactedly restored by [deletion]that excited[/deletion] 
the positive electricity in the plate separated
by water it follows that the plate must

I request you will notice pa 6/40 is

Sir
In my last communication which
in consequence of [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] hasty composition contains
some inaccuracies of expression I concluded
that the electrical effects produced by
the pile of [person]person_199|Volta[/person] somehow depended
on the oxydation of the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
Since that paper has been written I
have spent a portion of my time
in searching for other facts on the
same subject - 
In searching for facts either commensurable
or contradictory to those I stated in my last
communication I began by experimenting on
the substances which were good conductors of

[page]122|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00122|000122|000122[/page]

[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] highly concentrated [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical]
is a good secondary conductor of [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person]

This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [deletion]not only[/deletion] seems to prove
that the great use of the acids are
not as being better secondary conductors
than water; but from their power of oxydating

It was reasonable to conjecture that solutions

Pour Nitrous acid upon a great superabundance

[deletion]is[/deletion][insertion]an[/insertion] excellent conductor of [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]

The facts before mentioned prove that
a certain quantity of oxidation only is essential
supposing that the mass of the plates
are oxidating: the increasing nature of 
the process will enable the others to act
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver acted very well in water

after a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] [insertion]of[/insertion] which it will
[deletion]would to[/deletion] laborious & unnecessary to
give a minute detail I found
that [deletion]no gas perceptible [unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] all the

[insertion]without giving out any gas[/insertion] [deletion]no[/deletion] perceptible quantity of gas -
that the production of gas from
the silver did not at all depend
upon the form of the plates
but upon the [insertion]measure of [deletion]exposed[/deletion] surface exposed to the water[/insertion] [deletion]quantity of their[/deletion]
surface; [deletion]being[/deletion] the quantity being
in some measure inversely as the
quantity of surface - The large plates
giving out very little gas whilst it
was liberated plentifully from the
smaller ones & that in all exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
with common water the silver
became more or less incrusted.-
2. Considering these singular facts
[sidebar]I could not but conclude that [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical]
was fixed on the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] [insertion]in every part of the pile[/insertion] & [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
[deletion]either[/deletion] produced & either condensed [deletion]of[/deletion] or
liberated [insertion]from[/insertion] [deletion]on[/deletion] the surface of the silver
& when I considered the signs of
the presence of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammonia[/chemical] which I had
perceived when a pile was made

145
[sidebar]& the [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] [insertion]facts[/insertion] of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cruickshank I began to
[deletion]suspect[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]consider[/unclear][/insertion] that the [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] given out [deletion]from[/deletion] 
on the large surfaces was cheifly condensed
by the [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical] of the atmospheric
air dissolved in the water; whilst on
the smaller surfaces being less exposed
it was partly condensed & [insertion]but chiefly[/insertion] [deletion]partly[/deletion] 
liberated whilst from wires it was
liberated all together. These [unclear]conjectures[/unclear]
[insertion]were known[/insertion] In all these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] I used common
water it was consequently easy to
conceive that the white incrustation[/sidebar]
or precipitate on the silver might
be owing to the decomposition of
the magnesian salts dissolved in
that water.-
To [deletion]ascertain[/deletion] [deletion]the[/deletion] measure those conjectures
by facts, I made [deletion]several[/deletion] [insertion]many exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on different circles[/insertion] circles consisting
of from 17 to 30 [deletion]series of[/deletion] p glasses
In some of these glasses the silver
plates were very small in others they
were of the same size as the
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] - some of the glasses contained
distilled water others common water
[deletion]& a few red cabbage juice[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion] [deletion]mixed[/deletion]
[deletion]with[/deletion] both of which were occasionally
tinged with red cabbage juice. -
[deletion]In one exp[superscript]t[/superscript] a silver slip was[/deletion]
The general results were that in

[page]148|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00148|000148|000148[/page]
146
the common water & in the distilled
water. The cabbage juice [deletion]in a great[/deletion]
[deletion]length of time[/deletion] [insertion]slowly[/insertion] became green where
it was in contact with the silver
Whilst that part of it in contact
with the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] underwent no change
of color - In the common
water a white film always formed
on the surface of the water near
the silver; [insertion]sometimes a slight white precipitate[/insertion] whilst in distilled water
such an appearance was hardly
ever perceptible. The anomaly of
its being now & then perceptible I
am inclined to refer to the
accidental impurity of the Vessels-
with effervescence particularly as it was soluble without cloudiness
[insertion]& [deletion]with[/deletion]out effervescence in marine acid-.[/insertion] 
In one exp[superscript]t[/superscript] a silver slip forming
part of a [insertion]powerful[/insertion] circ[deletion]uit[/deletion]le was introduced into
a small vessel containing muriate
of [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] [insertion]& to prevent any interference in the result[/insertion] connected with the next
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] glass by means of muscular
fibre - In the course of a night

These [deletion]facts[/deletion] [insertion]results[/insertion] left no room for doubting

3 [person]person_948|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cruikshank[/person] who first [deletion]attempted[/deletion] [insertion]noticed[/insertion] to prove
the [insertion]probable[/insertion] formation of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical] [deletion]in the comi[/deletion] 
at the [chemical]chemical_007|[deletion]Hydrogene[/deletion][/chemical] [insertion]silver[/insertion] wire [deletion]of[/deletion] in the well
known exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on the decomposition of
water by the pile has offered some
some ingenious arguements to prove
that Nitrous acid is formed at the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
wire, Reasoning from analogy it would
be reasonable to infer [deletion]that[/deletion] if it
[deletion]existed[/deletion] [insertion]produced[/insertion] in one [deletion]part[/deletion] [insertion]of the series[/insertion] of the oxydating
metallic [deletion]plate[/deletion] it ought to be produced
in all. I have not however
been able to perceive any [insertion]decided[/insertion] change
of color [insertion]to red[/insertion] in [deletion]tincture[/deletion] water tinged with
[deletion]red[/deletion] cabbage juice [deletion]when placed[/deletion] in contact
with the oxydating [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates This however
may possibly be owing to the great
extension of the surface & [insertion]the feeble powers of the pile[/insertion] some facts
indeed have occurred to me which
seem to render doubtful even the
formation of Nitrous acid at the
oxydating pole in the common pile. -
Without attempting to decide the
question which is of much importance
I shall detail these facts . -
a Whenever [chemical]chemical_137|nitrous acid [/chemical][insertion]whether[/insertion] in a concentrated [insertion]or very diluted state[/insertion] state 
is made to act upon iron; it is [deletion]partly[/deletion] [insertion]never[/insertion]
wholly decomposed in oxydating the iron; some of it

149
uniformly combines with the red or green oxide
of iron formed so that [insertion]& I know of no mode[/insertion] is impossible to
make [chemical]chemical_137|nitrous acid [/chemical][insertion]in former[/insertion] act upon iron without
having a residual [deletion]fluid[/deletion] [insertion]nitrate[/insertion] which gives either
a blue or green tinge to [insertion]alkaline[/insertion] prussiates
supposing nitrous acid formed at the
oxydating wire in the pile it would
-it would follow from analogy
that [insertion]when[/insertion] this oxydating [deletion]wire[/deletion] was iron
it ought to produce in a minute
quantity of fluid a [insertion]the property[/insertion] [deletion]tendency[/deletion] of[deletion]to[/deletion]
giving prussian blue with alkaline
prussiates -
A iron wire connected with [insertion]the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical][/insertion] a pile of sixty
plates was introduced into about a drachm
of [deletion][insertion]pure[/insertion][/deletion] [deletion]water[/deletion] distilled water ; this water was
connected by a moistened thread
with a [deletion]vessel[/deletion] [insertion]glass of water[/insertion] [deletion]connected[/deletion] containing
the silver so as to prevent the
processes going on at the different
poles from disturbing each other
In the course of a night the iron
wire had been very much acted upon
& had thrown [insertion]much[/insertion] down green & yellow
[chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical] ; but prussiate of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical]
mingled with it produced no sensible
change of color.-
b [unclear]x[/unclear] [person]person_1028|Girtanners[/person] speculations [insertion]on the composition of [chemical]chemical_017|Azote[/chemical][/insertion] are founded upon
assertions [deletion]too vague &[/deletion] so contradictory to

[page]152|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00152|000152|000152[/page]
150
known facts as to demand but little
attention from enlightened chemists. -
At present therefore supposing the formation
of Nitrous acid we must conclude that 
it is produced by the union of nascent
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] from the oxidating base - 
with [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical] existing in common water.-
But I have found that when
the silver wires of ’a pile [insertion]exposed to the[/insertion] were
made to act on distilled water
In the vacuum of an air pump
the gage being at 6/10 the [deletion]pile[/deletion]
oxydation of the silver & the liberation
of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] proceeded as in the 
atmosphere; now supposing the oxidation
to have depended on the formation
of nitrous acid by the [chemical]chemical_017|Nitrogene[/chemical]
of [chemical]chemical_254|common air[/chemical] dissolved in the
water [insertion]& its decomposition[/insertion] it ought at least to
have been diminished. -
b. [deletion]When[/deletion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] The colors of the oxides produce
at the ends of wires may possibly
depend upon [chemical]chemical_058|Carbonic Acid[/chemical] it is
impossible; at the moment distilled
water is [insertion]cannot cool in contact with the[/insertion] cold it begins to
absorb small quantities of carbonic
acid from the atmosphere; They may
be produced when [chemical]chemical_180|Lime water[/chemical] is
used by [deletion]the[/deletion] a new combination. -
The strongest argument in favor of the

3 Considering the probable formation of 
[chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical] on all the silver plates
it became a subject of enquiry whether
this formation was connected with
the increase of power of the pile.-

To ascertain whether [insertion]wh[/insertion] [deletion]would be the effects[/deletion]
X [deletion]if[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]the surface[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]wires were substituted for discs[/deletion] -
whether diminution of the quantity of 
x surface of silver in the pile would
much diminish its effects. I fastened
some [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] silver wires [deletion]of about[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] 1/20 of
[deletion]an inch in[/deletion] circumference [insertion]& [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] length [unclear]xxxx xx[/unclear][/insertion] to some

some polished [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates & arranging
27 of them in the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
order [insertion]so that alternate of different sizes[/insertion] in glasses filled with
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver were distant from each other
At least an inch or

surprised when I made the communication
by receiving a feeble shock - & when

The circle by a silver wire - I perceived
[deletion]A[/deletion] gas forming & eliciting itself from
the greater number of the wires
It seemed to be given out in larger
quantities where the wires were
shortest in [deletion]some few[/deletion] [insertion]five or six[/insertion] no perceptible
quantity was produced; that [insertion][unclear]parts[/unclear] of the[/insertion] silver
wire supplying the place of the
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] seemed to oxydate vividly
& what much surprised me [deletion]white[/deletion]
[deletion]clouds seemed to fall[/deletion] a cloudiness
appeared at the point of other of
the wires giving out [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] -
This range of wires was however
soon deranged & I could never
produced [insertion]with simple water[/insertion] another equal to it in
power
A range of 28 [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates & silver
wires gave [deletion]feeble[/deletion] shocks [insertion]but[/insertion] hardly
perceptible to the [insertion]moistened[/insertion] fingers & most
of the wires inserted but a little
way into the water gave out
gas - from the others none was
liberated the cloudiness at the point
of some of the wires could not
be perceived as in the last exp[superscript]t[/superscript]- 
When a little muriate acid was
poured into each of 16 of the glasses
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] in these glasses began to give
out gas

[page]155|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00155|000155|000155[/page]
153
Mem[superscript]m[/superscript] the bottle scheme -
the powers of the [deletion]the[/deletion] range were much
increased - gas was disengaged from
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] by the action of the acid
& [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] all the silver wires gave
[deletion]out[/deletion] apparently gave out gas---
A pile in which warm water was
used instead of common water had
its powers of action but very little
increased. [Horizontal rule] & all the wires
not deeply inserted in the water
gave out gas
All these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] proved that wires were
[insertion]somewhat[/insertion] inferior to [insertion]large[/insertion] disks in common water
[deletion]about[/deletion] To ascertain whether this inferiority
[deletion]depended upon the smaller formation[/deletion]
[deletion]of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical][/deletion] [insertion]condensation of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical][/insertion] or [insertion]upon[/insertion] their [deletion]less[/deletion] [insertion]smaller[/insertion] capacity
for [deletion]electrical influence[/deletion] 
Supposing this inferiority rather to 
depend on their [deletion]less[/deletion] smaller [deletion]powers[/deletion] 
of [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] condensed upon their
rather than to their smaller capacities
for the electrical influence it was
reasonable to conclude that their
power [insertion]of [unclear]wires[/unclear][/insertion] would be much increased if
the [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] produced upon them
could be condensed in its nascent state

On the supposition I filled [deletion]some[/deletion] 13
glasses with solution of Red suphate
of iron [deletion]mixed with a little green[/deletion] [insertion]mixed with a little solution of green[/insertion]
[deletion]sulphate[/deletion] [insertion][chemical]chemical_352|Sulphate of Iron[/chemical] & [chemical]chemical_048|nitrous gas[/chemical][/insertion] formed by pouring nitrous 
acid in small quantities into
common [chemical]chemical_352|Sulphate of Iron[/chemical] [deletion]as I knew[/deletion] 
[deletion]from former exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] a substance
which former exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] had informed
me was capable of absorbing [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
Thes[deletion]e glasses[/deletion] range gave very sensible
shocks & its power of evolving
gases from water seemed equal
to that of a pile of 20
plates.-
When [deletion]four[/deletion] this [deletion]circle[/deletion] [insertion]series joined to another[/insertion] was compleated
[deletion][insertion]compleated[/insertion] by four[/deletion] [insertion]eight[/insertion] glasses containing plates of
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver wires with common water: [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical]
was disengaged from [deletion]all[/deletion] the wires - 
no gas was disengaged in any of
the glasses containing the solution but
[insertion]in a long time[/insertion] the silver wires became blackened by
the precipitation of a substance ([deletion]probably[/deletion] 
[deletion][chemical]chemical_166|red oxide of iron[/chemical][/deletion] upon them (which
as there was every reason to beleive
was green [chemical]chemical_166|Oxide of Iron[/chemical]; [deletion]the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates[/deletion] 
[deletion]gradually produced[/deletion] a dense cloud gradually
surrounded the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates [deletion]& yellow[/deletion]

155
the powers of the series gradually diminished
& in a day they were destroyed -
The [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates examined at the
end of this time were found
incrusted with green & red oxide
of iron but they had given out
no gas After being wiped with
a cloth they acted as powerfully
as before -
[deletion]Common[/deletion] This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] repeated with
red [chemical]chemical_352|Sulphate of Iron[/chemical]; with common

capable of [insertion][deletion]at the same of[/deletion][/insertion] absorbing nascent
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] & oxydating the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
gave always the same results.-
So that it would seem that the
powers of a pile were much
increased by [deletion]the[/deletion] [deletion][unclear]fixation[/unclear][/deletion] [deletion]of the[/deletion] [insertion]absorption of.[/insertion]
[chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] before it [insertion]assumed the elastic state[/insertion] When common sulphate

[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] fixed on the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] in every

composed of [insertion]easily[/insertion] oxidable metals & [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]

The power of the series with [deletion][chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates[/deletion] &

Supposing the formation of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical] it
was probable that the larger quantity
