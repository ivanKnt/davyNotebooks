Sir
In pursuing a course of experiments
on the Galvanic influence I have been
able to make some new observations
which as they are connected with
the [deletion]valuab[/deletion] curious facts detailed by
yourself & others in the last numbers
of your journal I [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] request you to
communicate [deletion]them[/deletion] to [deletion]the public[/deletion] [insertion]Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/insertion] through
the medium of that valuable publication.
[Horizontal rule]
The apparatus that I employed was
constructed at the request of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes
& consisted of 118 sets of Zinc & silver.-
I found the galvanic shock very much
increased when the parts through which
it passed were moistened with solution
of green sulphate of iron. A pile
erected with pieces of cloth wetted
[deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] this substance acted for a short
time much more powerfully than a
similar pile erected [deletion]with cloth soaked[/deletion] [insertion]in the usual mode[/insertion]
[deletion]in solution of salt, it rapidly however[/deletion]
[deletion]lost its powers in consequence of[/deletion]
[deletion]the decomposition of the sulphate of[/deletion]

it seemed however to lose its powers

[deletion]Two gla[/deletion] Struck with the curious phaenomena
noticed by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Nicholson namely the fixation
[sidebar] of oxygene at the point of one wire & the 
liberation of hydrogene from the other
[deletion]I[/deletion] my first researches [deletion]ma[/deletion] were directed
towards ascertaining; if oxygene & hydrogene
could be separately produced from
quantities of water not in contact with 
each other –
1
[deletion]Either two glasses of water were made[/deletion]
[deletion]to communicate one with the zinc end[/deletion]
[deletion]of the apparatus & the other with[/deletion] 
[deletion]the with each other by means of[/deletion]

[deletion]made eithroughtby the bodies of two[/deletion] or[/sidebar]

[deletion]in combination with that metal of[/deletion]
[deletion]the Zinc side & hydrogene given out[/deletion]
[sidebar][deletion]of that on the silver side, but[/deletion]
[deletion]if the wires were of gold[/deletion]
[deletion]oxygene was liberated[/deletion]
Knowing from the previous exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] that
the living animal was a good conductor
I dipped one [deletion]of[/deletion] of the fingers of the
right hand into one of these vessels
& those of my left hand into
the other, immediately after I received
the shock the [deletion]silver[/deletion] [insertion]Zinc[/insertion] wire began
to calcine very rapidly & white
[deletion]white[/deletion] clouds fell from it, the silver
[deletion]wires[/deletion] from the silver wire gas was
extruded with great rapidity, this gas
examined after the experiment had continued
for a great length of time proved
to be hydrogene mingled with a
small quantity of common air which
had been previously contained in the
water - When the communication [/sidebar]
was made by means of muscular
fibre living vegetable fibre or
moistened cloth or chord, the
same effects were produced as
likewise when the communication
was made by means of three persons.-

[page]16|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00016|000016|000016[/page]
14
the gas appeared to be disengaged
[deletion]more[/deletion] rapidly when muscular fibre was
employed, when a metallic wire
was used the same phaenomena
took place as M[superscript]r[/superscript] Nicholson has
described
2
[deletion]Two or[/deletion] into one end of each two
hollow tubes a small piece of [insertion]pure[/insertion] gold
wire was hermetically sealed they
were filled with boiled water [deletion]&[/deletion] inserted
- into two vessels of water that had
been just boiled & was yet warm. -
[deletion]gas was given out[/deletion] when the communication
was made between the two glasses by
means of muscular fibre gas was given
out very rapidly from the silver
but very little from the [deletion]g[/deletion] zinc it being
at first cheifly dissolved &c -
3.
Thus hydrogene was obtained pure from
one quantity of water whilst oxygene
was produced from the other, there was
not the slightest appearance of the
liberation of gas from the animal [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]or[/insertion]
vegetable fibre

To the Zinc end of a galvanic battery [insertion]one end of[/insertion] a
piece of dry; but fresh muscular fibre

was made between these two vessels
by means of a bit of gold wire
[deletion]as soon as it[/deletion] oxygene was given

When the communication was made
by means of muscular fibre or
moisture & pieces of metallic wire
placed beneath the surface of the
water no gas was given out
from them but when [deletion]the pieces[/deletion]

[deletion]In these From the results of these experiments[/deletion]
[deletion]it seems most probable[/deletion]
In the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the sulfuric acid & Nitric
acid it is most probable that the
acids were decomposed by the combination
of their oxygene with nascent hydrogene
given out in the silver tube-
In the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the muriatic acid &
Ammoniac the gold in [insertion]the[/insertion] Zinc tube was
most probably oxydated in consequence
of [deletion]what may be called[/deletion] predisposing affinity
none of the compound bodies appear to
have been immediately decomposed in consequence
by the galvanic influence - The difference
in [deletion]my ex[/deletion] the results of my exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] & those M[superscript]r[/superscript] Henry may be accounted for from
the different modes in which we operate
I suspect however [deletion]that if[/deletion] that ingenious
chemist [deletion]will compare[/deletion] [insertion]on [unclear]re[/unclear] repeating[/insertion] his exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on the
[deletion]solution[/deletion] solution of potash under new
circumstances [deletion]He[/deletion] will find reasons for
altering his conclusions with regard to
the decomposition of potash by the galvanic
influence
probably phosphoric acid [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] & other acids
[sidebar]dissolved in water may be decomposed [insertion]when[/insertion] exposed
to the nascent hydrogene extricated under[/sidebar]

the same ratio to the oxygene produced

Observations on the Nitric acid.
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley long ago observed that the substances
distinguished in the modern chemical nomenclature
by the names Nitric & Nitrous acids were
capable of [deletion]exi[/deletion] being exhibited in the [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] aëriform
state. The most elegant & convenient way
of producing aëriform nitrous acid is by
throwing into an exhausted balloon about
two parts of Nitrous gas & one part
of oxygene gas. in this [deletion]case[/deletion] [insertion]exp[superscript]t[/superscript][/insertion] a great
diminution of volume takes place & [deletion]the[/deletion]
[insertion]increase of temperature is observed &[/insertion] an orange gas is formed which
remains permanently aëriform at the 
temperatures of the atmosphere.
The affinity of Nitric acid in the aëriform
state for Nitrous gas is so great
that altho as superabundance of oxygene
gas [insertion]much[/insertion] more than sufficient to saturate
the Nitrous gas is thrown into the globe
yet stile it retains its yellow color &
when condensed by water is evidently
more or less phlogisticated.
‘Indeed Nitric acid itself may be considered
rather as a binary compound of Nitrous gas &
oxygen gas than as a binary compound
of Nitrogine & oxygene and as aeriform
Nitrous gas has a very strong affinity for
Nitrous & holds it in solution so aeriform

[page]22|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00022|000022|000022[/page]
20
Nitric acid has a strong affinity for Nitric
gas there are then in the [unclear]composition[/unclear] of
Nitric acid many nice affinities concerned
Nitric acid in the aeriform state contains
a considerable quantity of water & this
quantity reasoning from analogy must be
greater in proportion as the temp[superscript]e[/superscript]
is higher. -
It has long been considered as a matter
of importance in chemical [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] science
that the quantity of real or true
nitric acid in solutions of nitric acid
in water be ascertained M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan, &
Wenzel a mode. -
But as Nitrous acid gas at low temperatures
contain[deletion]ed[/deletion]ing in a globe containing a superabundance
of oxygene must always be of similar composition

In considering the constitution of atmospheric air
it becomes a [deletion]ques[/deletion] question of considerable importance
whether the light & heat produced during its
decomposition by combustible bodies were combined
with it whether they in a specific manner
belong to oxygene or whether they are found
between the interstices of all elastic fluids. - 
As far as we can reason from analogy
all bodies whatever when combined
with other bodies so as to have their
volume diminished have their power of
gravitation increased. Thus Hydrogene gas
which is 12 times lighter than common
air when condensed in water becomes
800 times heavier. - Supposing then that
any specific fluid is combined in atmospheric
air it follows that it might to gravitate
to ascertain whether it gravitates
sensibly - I made the following exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] -
combustion of phosphorus slow & quick. -
In the phaenomena of combination however
rapid we can discover no law but a
law of approximation, nothing is more
easy than to conceive that during this
approximation the ether between the particles
is pressed out with great velocity
& in proportion to its velocity becomes
heat or light –

The [insertion]3[/insertion] nature of this communication / is [insertion]2[/insertion] incompatible
with / a [insertion]1[/insertion] detail of the opinions prevailing amongst
philosophers respecting the causes of the galvanic
phaenomena: they have been generally supposed
to depend on the different powers of bodies
to conduct electric fluid; Fabbroni is the
first who systematically attempted to prove
that they were chemical effects.
Immediately after I had perused an [insertion]interesting[/insertion] observation of
Lieut Colonel Haldane on the non excitement
of galvanism in a boylean vacuum I began
an investigation with the view of ascertaining
precisely the influence of the atmosphere on
the phaenomena; In carrying on this investigation
I have met with some new facts, which
are capable of arrangement & which
[deletion]appear to[/deletion] will probably lead to a compleat
explanation of the galvanic effects
Of these facts [deletion]&[/deletion] & of some conclusions that may
be drawn from them I shall give a brief
account; [deletion][unclear]But[/unclear][/deletion] I must [insertion]however[/insertion] previously state
that the piles I employed for ascertaining
the influence of factitious airs on the

4. The galvanic pile of Signor Volta does not

The word pure is here used in the same

galvanic pile introduced into [deletion]Nitrogene[/deletion] Hydrogene
[insertion]through common water[/insertion] ceases to [deletion]act[/deletion] [insertion]evolve gas in the tube[/insertion] in about five or six
minutes, ie in the time required to
consume the common air confined in
the water between its plates-
The phaenomenon is exactly the same
in Nitrogene, hydrocarbonate, Nitrous
oxides & I beleive carbonic acid
though my exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on this last was
less often repeated than those [deletion]of[/deletion] on
the other gases - A pile ceases to
act in [unclear]N.H.[/unclear] &c nearly in
the same time & the action cannot
be restored by admitting fresh gases
of the same kind, it is however as
will be seen in the next immediately
restored by immersing the pile for
a moment in water saturated
with atmospheric air. - I have found
[insertion]by numerous[/insertion] [deletion]The galvanic pile ceases to act in[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]vacuue[/deletion] 
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] [deletion]made in conjuction[/deletion] with the assistance
of my friend, M[superscript]r[/superscript] King, that the galvanic

At nine tenths the shocks from wires
[deletion]introdu[/deletion] [insertion]of a pile of more than thirty[/insertion] connected with the atmosphere
[deletion]were[/deletion] feeble & sensibly diminished.-
The cement to come in here.-
The galvanic pile acts when the water between
its [deletion]pl[/deletion] double plates holds either Nitrous gas
[deletion]or[/deletion] Atmospheric air, [deletion]or[/deletion] oxygene, muriatic
acid or sulphuric acid or nitrous acid
in solution [deletion]&[/deletion]
The facts I have proved by [deletion]many[/deletion] [insertion]numerous[/insertion] exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
a pile acted in Nitrous gas for [insertion]three[/insertion]
seven hours, during this time the silver wire
in the tube was giving out [deletion]small[/deletion] [insertion]minute[/insertion]
single globules of air & a small quantity of oxide
formed on the silver wire a pile
introduced into Nitrous gas through water

to hydrogene [deletion]acted[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]evolv[/deletion] evolved gases from water[/insertion] for a considerable
length of time - the Zinc plates slowly

The atmospheric air [deletion]the[/deletion] included in a

through two days & infinitely
more [deletion][unclear]raised[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]gas was evolved & more oxide formed-[/insertion] than in nitrous gas
In [deletion]oxygene[/deletion] & the air was deprived of much
of its oxygene & apparently ammoniac
formed.-

That the influence of the elastic air
[deletion]could[/deletion] has no independant power is evident
from the uniform & constant restoration
of the powers [insertion]after they had ceased in hydrogene[/insertion] of a pile by
immersion in [deletion]Atmosp[/deletion] water [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] saturated
with atmospheric air - In these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
the piles were plunged for a moment
in the water confining the gas without
NO being brought [insertion]even[/insertion] partially [deletion]or wholly[/deletion]
in contact with the atmosphere
& instantly elevated in the gas again
& it could be [insertion]only to[/insertion] [deletion]the water[/deletion] impregnation
of the water with atmospheric air
that the phaenomenon was owing
because when the pile was plunged
into water saturated with Nitrous
oxide a gas which as I have
proved expels much of the oxygene
from water the power was not
restored. - The oil of turpentine
b A galvanic pile inclosed in a
cylinder containing [insertion]about[/insertion] 35 inches of oxygene
acted much more powerfully than
a similar pile in atmospheric
air. - & the gas was diminished
a After a pile had ceased to act in
hydrogene it was immerged [insertion]for a moment[/insertion] in water
impregnated with marine acid [deletion]it acted[/deletion] 
[deletion]for many[/deletion] after this it acted for
no shock when the ends of a pile were touched

many minutes full as powerfully as
it would have done in the atmosphere
- A similar pile in hydrogene was immerged
for two or three seconds in a
very dilute solution of Nitric acid
It acted more powerfully than if it
had been in an atmosphere of
oxygene.
6: The [insertion]power of[/insertion] action of the pile of Volta is
proportional to the [deletion]quantity of oxygene[/deletion] 
[deletion]composition[/deletion] power of the conducting
fluid substance between the double plates
to oxydate the Zinc. -
This seems sufficiently proved in the [deletion]following[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]foregoing[/unclear][/insertion]
sections, the Zinc oxydates more rapidly
in Nitrous gas than in common air
& the power of the pile in [deletion]nitrous gas[/deletion] 
[deletion]oxygene[/deletion] is [deletion]greater[/deletion] [insertion]less[/insertion] than in common
air It oxydates more rapidly in
oxygene than in common air &

dipped in muriatic acid or diluted
nitrous acid than [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] when it has

- Conclusions - -
[Marginal note in pencil] Of two phaenomena or of two series
of phaenomena we can only affirm
cause & effect because the one uniformly
precedes the other & because when
the one is modified the other
is likewise modified; but it appears
from all the foregoing facts that
[deletion]the the powers of[/deletion] the galvanic
pile of Volta acts only when
the conducting substance between its
plates is capable of oxydating
the Zinc & that in proportion
as a greater [deletion]proportion[/deletion] [insertion]quantity[/insertion] of oxygene
is combined with the zinc in
a given time so in proportion
[deletion]are[/deletion] is the galvanic power of
the machine to produce water 
[Marginal note in pencil] & to give the shock greater- -
We may therefore affirm that the
fixation of oxygene in the Zinc
in the pile of Volta is the 
cause of the galvanic or electric

The motive power in the galvanic pile appears
to be the oxidation of the Zinc; the silver &
the alternate series of plates & water is essential
both to the evolution of gases from water
& to the negative and positive electricity
but these series must be connected in
a circle. thus silver & Zinc & water
silver Zinc & water [deletion]in[/deletion] & so on in
any ratio in a line appear to produce
no effect th[deletion]r[/deletion]o [deletion]in a[/deletion] [insertion]when in a[/insertion] circle hydrogene
is given out from every surface of
[deletion]Zinc[/deletion] Silver & oxygene [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]fixed on[/insertion] every surface
of Zinc, but the Zinc & Silver form
no galvanic circle when in a line
though when in a circle the medium
of communication is through the whole
of the alternate circles; & wherever
the place of Zinc & silver is
supplied by a [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxx xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
single arc either of charcoal or 
of metals; hydrogene is evolved from
one side ie the place of the
silver & oxygene fixed & evolved
from the place of the Zinc: this
shows that the process of chemical
action is owing to certain increase
of power ie to certain accumulation

of power enabling oxygene to be evolved
where it cannot be fixed in
the alternate circles of gold or platina
Let us now form on hypothesis
Suppose when the Zinc is oxydated it
becomes positively electrified & that in
[X] consequence the silver becomes negatively
electrified & the water is the medium
of connection in the common galvanic
circle; then it is a law of
electricity that light bodies [deletion][unclear]were[/unclear][/deletion] are
are easiest charged with electricity it
consequently follows that the hydrogene
[deletion][unclear]will[/unclear][/deletion] rather than be elicited from the
water will pass to the silver
[sidenar]give out to it is [unclear]xxxxxxxxxxx[/unclear]
electricity & be eliccited in
the form of gas its equilibrium
being restored – 
Suppose when the Zinc is oxidated it
becomes positively electrified & the silver
negatively in the double circuit then
when a [deletion]compleat[/deletion] line is formed
the water is the medium of connection
then the positive electricity of the Zinc acts
upon the water & produces negative
[deletion]electricity[/deletion] but as it is impossible
that in [deletion][unclear]a[/unclear][/deletion] circles separated by water

Sir
In persusing my paper in your last
number I have observed two errors which 
I request you will notice pa 6/40 is
to be found instead of 6/10 & proportional
instead of in great measure
proportional. – 
Sir
In my last communication which
in consequence of [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] hasty composition contains
some inaccuracies of expression I concluded
that the electrical effects produced by
the pile of Volta somehow depended
on the oxydation of the Zinc
Since that paper has been written I
have spent a portion of my time
in searching for other facts on the
same subject - 
In searching for facts either commensurable
or contradictory to those I stated in my last
communication I began by experimenting on
the substances which were good conductors of

[page]122|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00122|000122|000122[/page]
120
secondary conductors of the galvanic influence
but which were incapable of oxydating the 
Zinc highly concentrated sulphuric acid
is a good secondary conductor of galvanic
as is evident from the evolution of
gases though. it possesses but little
power of action on Zinc when in
a highly concentrated state

kind tho when a drop of water
was added to this [deletion]wires[/deletion][insertion]acid[/insertion] in each 
of the cells; the [deletion]wires[/deletion][insertion]silvers[/insertion] wires
connected with the glass of water
immediately began to decompose
the water pretty vividly. - 
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] [deletion]not only[/deletion] seems to prove
that the great use of the acids are
not as being better secondary conductors
than water; but from their power of oxydating

It was reasonable to conjecture that solutions
of hydrosulphures would be unable to oxydate

The facts before mentioned prove that
a certain quantity of oxidation only is essential

are oxidating: the increasing nature of 
the process will enable the others to act

narrated in my last paper sufficiently
warrant the conclusion of the dependance
of the powers of the pile of Volta
on the oxydation of the metals
particularly when we consider that the
most powerful primary galvanic excitors are
those which have most affinity for oxygene.
& that the ratio of power is
proportional to this affinity.

But what is the influence of the
silver in the process how are the 
[sidebar]negative & positive electricity exited
when the exciting bodies are in

what causes do the different poles

of water oxygene & hydrogene

of these [insertion]& other[/insertion] interesting problems [deletion]it was[/deletion] 
I was convinced could not be

as the [insertion]fundamental[/insertion] facts were analogous to
no others; I endeavored to collect
observations from a minute examination[/sidebar]
of the whole of the process –

was felt when Silver wire was introduced

After occasional attention to the

from it no gas had formed upon
the silver: but the water in contact
with each of the discs became
white with its surface & covered
with a thin follicle.-. The silver
plates were not [deletion]clean[/deletion] [insertion]perfectly[/insertion] polished this might have disturbed

I now broke the connection between

but still the same effects were

influence the result. I inclosed

after a number of exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] [insertion]of[/insertion] which it will
[deletion]would to[/deletion] laborious & unnecessary to
give a minute detail I found
that [deletion]no gas perceptible [unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] all the

the galvanic [unclear]circuit[/unclear] [insertion]with [deletion]common[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]gave out[/deletion] 
[insertion]without giving out any gas[/insertion] [deletion]no[/deletion] perceptible quantity of gas -
that the production of gas from
the silver did not at all depend
upon the form of the plates
but upon the [insertion]measure of [deletion]exposed[/deletion] surface exposed to the water[/insertion] [deletion]quantity of their[/deletion]
surface; [deletion]being[/deletion] the quantity being
in some measure inversely as the
quantity of surface - The large plates
giving out very little gas whilst it
was liberated plentifully from the
smaller ones & that in all exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
with common water the silver
became more or less incrusted.-
2. Considering these singular facts
[sidebar]I could not but conclude that oxygene
was fixed on the Zinc [insertion]in every part of the pile[/insertion] & hydrogene
[deletion]either[/deletion] produced & either condensed [deletion]of[/deletion] or
liberated [insertion]from[/insertion] [deletion]on[/deletion] the surface of the silver
& when I considered the signs of
the presence of Ammonia which I had
perceived when a pile was made
to act in inclosed common air[/sidebar]

[page]147|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00147|000147|000147[/page]
145
[sidebar]the [deletion]exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] [insertion]facts[/insertion] of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cruickshank I began to
[deletion]suspect[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]connect[/unclear][/insertion] that the hydrogene given out [deletion]from[/deletion] 
on the large surfaces was cheifly condensed
by the Nitrogene of the atmospheric
air dissolved in the water; whilst on
the smaller surfaces being less exposed
it was partly condensed & [insertion]but chiefly[/insertion] [deletion]partly[/deletion] 
liberated whilst from wires it was
liberated all together. These [unclear]conjectures[/unclear]
[insertion]were known[/insertion] In all these exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] I used common
water it was consequently easy to
conceive that the white incrustation[/sidebar]
or precipitate on the silver might
be owing to the decomposition of
the magnesium salts dissolved in
that water.-
To [deletion]oxidation[/deletion] [deletion]the[/deletion] measure those conjectures
by facts, I made [deletion]several[/deletion] [insertion]many exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on different circles[/insertion] circles consisting
of from 17 to 30 [deletion]series of[/deletion] p glasses
In some of these glasses the silver
plates were very small in others they
were of the same size as the
Zinc - some of the glasses contained
distilled water others common water
[deletion]& a few red cabbage juice[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion] [deletion]mixed[/deletion]
[deletion]with[/deletion] both of which were occasionally
tinged with red cabbage juice. -
[deletion]The same exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] a silver slip was[/deletion]
The general results were that in

[page]148|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00148|000148|000148[/page]
146
the common water & in the distilled
water. The cabbage juice [deletion]in a great[/deletion]
[deletion]length of time[/deletion] [insertion]slowly[/insertion] became green where
it was in contact with the silver
Whilst that part of it in contact
with the Zinc underwent no change
of color - In the common
water a white film always formed
on the surface of the water near
the silver; [insertion]sometimes a slight white precipitate[/insertion] whilst in distilled water
such an appearance was hardly
ever perceptible. The anomaly of
its being new & then perceptible I
am inclined to refer to the
accidental impurity of the Vessels-
with effervescence particularly as it was soluble without cloudiness
[insertion]& [deletion]with[/deletion]out effervescence in marine acid-.[/insertion] 
In one exp[superscript]t[/superscript] a silver slip forming
part of a [insertion]powerful[/insertion] circ[deletion]uit[/deletion]le was introduced into
a small vessel containing muriate
of magnesia [insertion]& to prevent any interference in the result[/insertion] connected with the next

3 M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cruikshank who first [deletion]attempted[/deletion] [insertion]noticed[/insertion] to prove
the [insertion]probable[/insertion] formation of ammoniac [deletion]in the comi[/deletion] 
at the [deletion]hydrogene[/deletion] [insertion]silver[/insertion] wire [deletion]of[/deletion] in the well
known exp[superscript]t[/superscript] on the decomposition of
water by the pile has offered some
some ingenious arguements to prove
that Nitrous acid is formed at the Zinc
wire, Reasoning from analogy it would
be reasonable to infer [deletion]that[/deletion] if it
[deletion]existed[/deletion] [insertion]produced[/insertion] in one [deletion]part[/deletion] [insertion]of the series[/insertion] of the oxydating
metallic [deletion]plate[/deletion] it ought to be produced
in all. I have not however
been able to perceive any [insertion]decided[/insertion] change
of color [insertion]to red[/insertion] in [deletion]tincture[/deletion] water tinged with
[deletion]red[/deletion] cabbage juice [deletion]when placed[/deletion] in contact
with the oxydating Zinc plates This however
may possibly be owing to the great
extension of the surface & [insertion]the feeble powers of the pile[/insertion] some facts
indeed have occurred to me which
seem to render doubtful even the
formation of Nitrous acid at the
oxydating pole in the common pile. -
Without attempting to decide the
question which is of much importance
I shall detail these facts . -
a Whenever Nitrous acid [insertion]whether[/insertion] in a concentrated [insertion]or very diluted state[/insertion] state 
is made to act upon iron; it is [deletion]partly[/deletion] [insertion]never[/insertion]
wholly decomposed in oxydating the iron; some of it

[page]151|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00151|000151|000151[/page]
149
uniformly combines with the red or green oxide
of iron formed so that [insertion]& I know of no mode[/insertion] is impossible to
make nitrous acid [insertion]in former[/insertion] act upon iron without
having a residual [deletion]fluid[/deletion] [insertion]nitrate[/insertion] which gives either
a blue or green tinge to [insertion]alkaline[/insertion] prussiates
supposing nitrous acid formed at the
oxydating wire in the pile it would
-it would follow from analogy
that [insertion]when[/insertion] this oxydating [deletion]wire[/deletion] was iron
it ought to produce in a minute
quantity of fluid a [insertion]the property[/insertion] [deletion]tendency[/deletion] of[deletion]to[/deletion]
giving prussian blue with alkaline
prussiates -
A iron wire connected with [insertion]the Zinc[/insertion] a pile of sixty
plates was introduced into about a drachm
of [insertion]pure[/insertion] [deletion]water[/deletion] distilled water ; this water was
connected by a moistened thread
with a [deletion]vessel[/deletion] [insertion]glass of water[/insertion] [deletion]connected[/deletion] containing
the silver so as to prevent the
processes going on at the different
poles from disturbing each other
In the course of a night the iron
wire had been very much acted upon
& had thrown [insertion]much[/insertion] down green & yellow
oxide of iron ; but prussiate of potash
mingled with it produced no sensible
change of color.-
[unclear]xxx[/unclear] Girtanners speculations [insertion]on the composition of Azote[/insertion] are founded upon
assertions [deletion]too vague &[/deletion] so contradictory to

[page]152|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00152|000152|000152[/page]
150
known facts as to demand but little
attention from enlightened chemists. -
At present therefore supporting the formation
of Nitrous acid we must conclude that 
it is produced by the union of nascent
oxygene from the oxidating base - 
with nitrogene existing in common water.-
But I have found that when
the silver wires of ’a pile [insertion]exposed to the[/insertion] [unclear]wire[/unclear]
made to act in distilled water
In the vacuum of an air pump
the gage being at 6/10 the [deletion]pile[/deletion]
oxydation of the silver & the liberation
of hydrogene proceeded as in the 
atmosphere; now suffering the oxidation
to have depended on the formation
of nitrous acid by the nitrogene
of common air dissolved in the
water [insertion]& its decomposition[/insertion] it might at least to
have been diminished. -
b. [deletion]When[/deletion] [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] The colors of the oxides produce
at the ends of wires may possibly
depend upon carbonic acid it is
impossible; at the moment distilled
water is [insertion]cannot come in contact with the[/insertion] cold it begins to
have small quantity of carbonic
acid from the atmosphere; They may
be produced when lime water
used by [deletion]the[/deletion] a new combination. -

3 Considering the probable formation of 
Ammoniae on all the silver plates
it became a subject of enquiry whether
this formation was connected with
the increase of power of the pile.-

To ascertain whether [insertion]wh[/insertion] [deletion]would be the effects[/deletion]
X [deletion]if[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]the surface[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]wires were substituted for discs[/deletion] -
whether diminution of the quantity of 
x surface of silver in the pile would
much diminish its effects. I fastened
some [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] silver wires [deletion]of about[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] 1/20 of
[deletion]an inch in[/deletion] circumference [insertion]& [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] length [unclear]xxxx xx[/unclear][/insertion] to some

27 of them in the galvanic
order [insertion]so that alternate of different sizes[/insertion] in glasses filled with
Zinc & silver were distant from each other
At lease an inch or

surprised when I made the communication
by receiving a feeble shock - & when

The circle by a silver wire - I perceived
[deletion]A[/deletion] gas forming & eliciting itself from
the greater number of the wires
It seemed to be given out in larger
quantities where the wires were
shortest in [deletion]some few[/deletion] [insertion]five or six[/insertion] no perceptible
quantity was produced; that [insertion][unclear]some[/unclear] of the[/insertion] silver
wire supplying the place of the
Zinc seemed to oxydate vividly
& what much surprised me [deletion]white[/deletion]
[deletion]clouds seemed to pull[/deletion] a cloudiness
appeared at the point of other of
the wires giving out hydrogene -
This range of wires was however
soon deranged & I could never
produced [insertion]with simple water[/insertion] another equal to it in
power
A range of 28 Zinc plates & silver
wires gave [deletion]feeble[/deletion] shocks [insertion]but[/insertion] hardly
perceptible to the [insertion]moistened[/insertion] fingers & most
of the wires inserted but a little
way into the water gave out
gas - from the others none was
liberated the cloudiness at the point
of some of the wires could not
be perceived as in the last exp[superscript]t[/superscript]- 
When a little muriate acid was
poured into each of 16 of the glasses
the Zinc in these glasses began to give
out gas

153
Mem[superscript]m[/superscript] the bottle scheme -
the powers of the [deletion]the[/deletion] range were much
increased - gas was disengaged from
the Zinc by the action of the acid
& [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] all the silver wires gave
[deletion]out[/deletion] apparently gave out gas---
A pile in which warm water was
used instead of common water had
its powers of action but very little
increased. [Horizontal rule] & all the wires
not deeply inserted in the water
gave out gas
All there exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] proved that wires were
[insertion]somewhat[/insertion] inferior to [insertion]large[/insertion] disks in common water
[deletion]What[/deletion] To ascertain whether this inferiority
[deletion]depended upon the smaller formation[/deletion]
[deletion]of ammoniac[/deletion] [insertion]condensation of hydrogene[/insertion] or [insertion]upon[/insertion] their [deletion]less[/deletion] [insertion]smaller[/insertion] capacity
for [deletion]electrical influence[/deletion] 
Supposing this inferiority rather to 
depend on their [deletion]less[/deletion] smaller [deletion]powers[/deletion] 
of hydrogene condensed upon their
rather than to their smaller capacities
for the electrical influence it was
reasonable to conclude that their
power [insertion]of [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/insertion] would be much increased if
the hydrogene produced upon them
could be condensed in its nascent state

On the supposition I filled [deletion]some[/deletion] 13
glasses with solution of Red suphate
of iron [deletion]mixed with a little green[/deletion] [insertion]mixed with a little solution of green[/insertion]
[deletion]sulphate[/deletion] [insertion]sulphate of iron & Nitrous gas[/insertion] formed by pouring nitrous 
acid in small quantities into
common sulphate of iron [deletion]as I knew[/deletion] 
[deletion]from former exp[superscript]ts[/superscript][/deletion] a substance
which former exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] had informed
me was capable of absorbing hydrogen
Thes[deletion]e glasses[/deletion] range gave very sensible
shocks & its power of evolving
gases from water seemed equal
to that of a pile of 20
plates.-
When [deletion]four[/deletion] this [deletion]circle[/deletion] [insertion]series joined to another[/insertion] was compleated
[deletion][insertion]compleated[/insertion] by four[/deletion] [insertion]eight[/insertion] glasses containing plates of
Zinc & silver wires with common water: hydrogene
was disengaged from [deletion]all[/deletion] the wires - 
no gas was disengaged in any of
the glasses containing the solution but
[insertion]in a long time[/insertion] the silver wires became blackened by
the precipitation of a substance ([deletion]probably[/deletion] 
[deletion]red oxide of iron[/deletion] upon them (which
as there was every reason to beleive
was green oxide of iron; [deletion]the Zinc plates[/deletion] 
[deletion]gradually produced[/deletion] a dense cloud gradually
surrounded the Zinc plates [deletion]& yellow[/deletion] 
[deletion]& green oxide of iron were both[/deletion]
[deletion]precipitated & incrusted upon[/deletion] them

[page]157|MS-DAVY-12003-000-00157|000157|000157[/page]
155
the powers of the series gradually diminished
& in a day they were destroyed -
The Zinc plates examined at the
end of their time were found
incrusted with green & red oxide
of iron but they had given out
no gas After being wiped with
a cloth they acted as powerfully
as before -
[deletion]Common[/deletion] This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] repeated with
red sulphate of iron; with common
sulphate of iron & other substances
capable of [insertion][deletion]at the same of[/deletion][/insertion] absorbing nascent
hydrogen & oxydating the Zinc
gave always the same results.-
So that it would seem that the
powers of a pile were much
increased by [deletion]the[/deletion] [deletion][unclear]fixation[/unclear][/deletion] [deletion]of the[/deletion] [insertion]absorption of.[/insertion]
hydrogen before it [insertion]assumed the elastic state[/insertion] When common sulphate
of iron was captured but a slight
precipitation took place on the silver
wires & they gave out a little

After more than twelve hours the Zinc
plates had become tarnished but had given

The substitution of oblong [insertion]silver[/insertion] slips for many of

silver wires was less than that with plates
Supposing the formation of ammoniac it
was probable that the larger quantity
