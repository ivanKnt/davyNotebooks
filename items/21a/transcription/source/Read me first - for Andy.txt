Hi Andy,

This is the nightmare maths notebook. We had to employ two postdocs, Brigitte and Nicolas, both of whom have specialist knowledge of nineteenth-century maths, to transcribe this 'off Zooniverse' - Brigitte started it, and Nicolas finished it. The 'dnp21a TranscriptionDavy Michel' file is the transcription that Nicolas turned in; the 'dnp21a NotesTranscription' is an explanatory document that he submitted with the transcription. I've included the manifest with the others, but it might not be useful as we went 'off Zooniverse' for this one.

Best,

Andrew
