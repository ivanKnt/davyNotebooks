Notations:

	- For the most part, I have used TeX commands to transcribe the mathematical symbols used by Davy throughout these notebooks. A list may be found here: https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols
	- When deviating from standard TeX commands, I have added in comments to the right of the transcription to indicate it. 
	- I have sought to transcribe Davy's symbols, and not the mathematical meaning behind them. Thus, I use \sqsubset subset for the "["-like symbol used by Davy to denote "greater than", despite this symbol being very counter-intuitive to modern readers (who would expect the symbol to face the other way)
	- Specific notations of mine used constantly throughout the document include:
		- [text] for insertions
		- [st] for strikethroughs 
		- [ul] for underlines 
		- \angle, \Rangle, \Oangle etc., for the various signs used by Davy to represent angles, right angles, obtuse angles etc. The first occurrences of such commands are usually explained in the comments.
		- \triangle, \Etriangle, \Otriangle etc., idem for triangle signs.
		- [box] before transcribing parts of the text which are enclosed in a box or some loose lines drawn by Davy to separate a bit of text.

Varia:
	- I have differentiated between strikethroughs (i.e., drawing one or several lines over previous text) and erasures (the removal of ink through the application of tissue or a finger).
	- I have sought to render the spatial organisation of the text to the best of my ability, this is not always possible however within the limitations of this format. 
	- When describing a diagram drawn by Davy as a "Euclidean diagram", I do not mean that it is conform to diagrams found in modern scientific editions of Euclid, what rather that it obeys the rules of a well-established medieval and early-modern tradition of diagram-making (in its labelling, the sort of lines used in it, the absence of numerical values etc.)
	
I suspect two sources used by Davy in his mathematical education are Robert Simson's English edition of Euclid's Elements, and John Keill's Elements of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry.
