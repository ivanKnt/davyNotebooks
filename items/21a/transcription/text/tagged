 - Friendship - 

Man [st]is like a shipwrecked[\st] sailor lost in the vast & [ilegible]
Ocean of his passions is like a shipwrecked sailor
who catches hold of every straw which He supposes 
may keep him above Water a little longer.-
The Case is the same with Man cast into the 
fast & tumultuous ocean of Existence. torn by 
contending passions life seems of little Estimation
when rationally considered. Man is a being 
so torn by Misfortunes so agitated by Hopes & 
fears that his pain seems to predominate 
over his pleasure. The love of life is a passion 
wei[unclear, old spelling of way?] powerful & active &c. 
but amongst the Good which Life produces Friendship
may be reckoned amongst the first. It is a passion productive
of more felicity when flowing in its proper Channel
than any other that agitates the Mind
What indeed can be more sweet than to be able to double your pleasures & divide your pains

1^st A proper Fraction is that which is less than an Unit as \frac{1}{3}

2^d An Improper Fraction is that which is greater than an Unit as \frac{5}{3}.-

3^d A Compound Fraction is a Part of a Part as \frac{1}{3} of \frac{3}{4}.-

All compound Fractions are reduced into single ones thus.-

Rule. Multiply all the numerators into one another for a Numerator 
& all the Denominators into one the other for a Denominator. 

----

Thus The \frac{1}{3} of \frac{3}{4} of {2}{5} these multiplied = \frac{6}{60} \divide 6 = \frac{1}{10}.
											  these = ---

----

Sec^n: 3^d. To bring mixed N^os into Fractions & the Contrary.- 
Rule. Multiply the Integers with the Denominator of the given Fraction, 
and to their Product add the Numerator, The sum will be the Numerator 
of the Fraction required.- Example. 9\frac{4}{5}. 9 \times 5 = \frac{45}{5} + to 4 = \frac{49}{5} 2De:		 [Second example?]
2. 3\frac{2}{5} 3 \times 5 = \frac{15}{5} + 2 = \frac{17}{5}. Answer  17\frac{3}[5} 17 \times 5 = 85 + 3 = 88 Ans ^n.

When any Proposed N^o of Decimals is to be multiplied with 
10.100.1000. it is only removing the separating Part in 
the Multiplicand so many places towards the right 
hand as there are Cyphers in the multiplier 

Thus' 5,78 \times 10 = 5,78. & 578 \times 100 = '57,8. '578 -\times 1000 
= 578 '578 \times 10000 = 5780. These Things being 
considered it will be easy to multiply Decimals & determine 
their Product: 5705 \times '0578 = 32,978368--- [note: this is incorrect, the answer should be 329.749] 
Rule let the Units Places of the Multiplier directly underneath 
that figure of the Multiplicand whose place you intend to keep 
in the product & place all the other figures of the Multiplier
in a quite contrary order to the usual way. Then in Multiplying 
always begin at that figure of the Multiplicand which stands over 
the figure wherewith you are then on Multiplying, setting down 
the first figure of each particular product directly underneath 
one the other Yet you must have a due regard to the

The whole triangle = to the \triangle. But BD = BE & BA = BC.
Therefore AD = CE [illegible] The side AE has been proved = to DC & \angle

Definitions

1. Equal circles are such as have = Diameter or = Radii---
2  A Right line is said to touch a Circle meeting it when Produce'd 
it does not cut it---
3  Circles are said to touch each other which meeting do not 
cut each other---
4. Right lines in a Circle are said to be equally distant from 
the center when Perpendic^s: drawn from the Center to them are =
5 & that line is farthest from the Center on which the greatest 
Perpendicular falls--- 
6. The segment of A Circle is a figure contained under 
a right line & part of the circumference of a Circle 
7. An \angle of a segment is that which is contained 
by a right line & part of the Circumference of the Circle 
8  An Angle is said to be in a segment when some is taken in 
the Circumference thereof & from it right lines are drawn [st][illegible][/st] 
to the End of that Right [st]Angle[/st] Line which is the base of the Segment
9  But when the right lines contain'g the \angle do receive any 
Circumference of the Circumference of the Circle then the \angle 
is said to stand upon the Circumference-
10  A sector of a \circle is that Figure which is comprehended 
between two right lines drawn from the Centre & the Circumference 
contained between them---
11. Similar segments of Circles are those which contain 
= \angle^s.

Prop^n: 15. Prob: To inscribe an Equilateral & equiangular 
Hexagon in a given Circle---

Let ABCDEF be the Given Circle find its Centre G & draw the 
Diameter DA & from D as a Centre at the Distance DG describe the Circle ECH
Join EG. CG & produce them to the Points B, F & Join 
AB. BD. CD. DE. EF. FA the Hexagon BC. DE. FA is equiangular 
& equilateral. The three lines. EG. GD. GE are all = being 
radii of equal Circles consequently the \triangle GED is equilat^l. 
& equiangular & in the \triangle AGF there are two [written over an \angle symbol:]sides[\] AG 
GF = to 2 sides GE GD  & the Angle AGF = to the \angle EGD 
they being vertical \angle^s therefore is the other side EF = to the 
other side ED. therefore both triangles are mutually equi-
& as the the \angle^s AGF. DGC are each 1/3 of two Rect^es. the 
other \angle FGC must be also 1/3 but the \triangle FGC has an \angle^e. 
& two sides = to the other 2 \triangle^s therefore it is also = 
to them & an \equilateral \triangle in the same manner it may 											[\equilateral: an '=' sign with an 'e' on top]
be demonstrated that all the six \triangle^s are \equilateral & \equiangular. 							[\equilateral: an '=' sign with an 'n' on top]
Therefore the sides of the Hexagon BA. AF. FC. CD. DE. EB are all 
= & as the Part of the Circumf: BAFC = the Circum BEDC. 
add to the Circum: BEDC the part. CF = to the part BE which add to 
BAFC then the Circ: EBAFC = the Circum: CFDEB but in 
= \circle = \angle^s stand upon equal parts of the Circumference therefore 
the \angle^s EDC = the \angle BAF in the same manner it may be 
demonstrated that all the \angle^es of the Hexagon are = & it 
is described in the Circle QDE

AC being a third part of the whole contains five 
& the Circumference AB being a fifth part of the 
whole contains three. therefore BC their Difference 
contains 2 Bisect BC in E. & BE. BC will be each

1 A less Magnitude is said to be a part of a greater when the less measures 
the greater--
2 A greater Magnitude is said to be a multiple of a less[erased]er[\erased] when the \sqsubset 
is measured by the less. 
3 Ratio -- 4 Magnitudes are said to have a Ratio to each other when 
the less can be multiplied so as to exceed the other-- 
5 The first of four Magnitudes is said to have the same ratio to the 2 
that the 3^d has to the fourth when any equimult: of the first & third & of the 2^d & 4^th 
being taken if the multiple of the first be \sqsupset = or \sqsubset than the Multiple of the 2^d the 
Multiple of the 3^d is also \sqsupset = or \sqsubset than the multip: of the fourth-- 
6 Magnitudes which have the same ratio are called proportionals
7. When [of] the = mult: of 4 Mag: taken as in the 5 Def: the Mult: of the 1^st is \sqsubset 
than that of the 2^d but the Multiple of the third is not \sqsubset than that of the 4^th 
then the 1^st. is said to have to the 2^d a \sqsubset Ratio than the third has to the fourth 
& on the Contrary the third is said to have to the 4th a \sqsupset Ratio than the 1^st. to the 2^d.
8 Analogy or Proportion is the similitude of Ratios. 9 proportion consists in three terms at [least]. 
10. When three Magnitudes are proportionals the first is said to have to the third the Duplicate 
Ratio of that it has to the 2^d.

					Geometers make use of the following technical Terms to signify ways of changing Proportionals without.

is to the second of the first rank as the first to the second of the other rank

						Prop^n: 1^st Theorem~ 

If any N^o of Mag: be equimul: of as many, each of each. what Multiple soever any one of 
them is of its part, the same Multiple shall all the first Magnitudes be of all the others. 
Let any N^o of mag: AB. CD. be = mult^s. of as many others EF each of each 							
whatsoever multiple AB is of E. the same multiple shall. AB & CD together be of E + F.
D Because AB is the same Multiple of E that CD is of F. There are in AB. 
as many magnitudes = to E as there are in CD = to F Divide AB & CD into 
Magnitudes = to E. & F. viz AG GB. & CH. HD. The N^o of the Magnitudes 
CH. HD = the N^o. of AG. GB. & because AG is = to E & CH = to F 
AG & CH together are = to E & F together & for the same reason 
because GB = E & HD. F. GB. HD. together = E & F together	[QDE] 
Therefore if any magnitudes How many soever are = multiples of as many 
each of each whatsoever Multiple any one of them is of its Part the same multip: 
shall all the first Magnitudes be of all the other---
