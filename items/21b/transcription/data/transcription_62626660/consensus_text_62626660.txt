In common education mathematical science
has been recommended not on account
of its application to the phaenomena
of the universe, but because it
produces in the mind a habit of
forming reasonings only upon the
bases of Known & obvious propositions
But the most pure most perfect logic
is useless unless it is made the
expression of facts: that mathematical
science is an expression of facts
[deletion]has been pro[/deletion] in its origin has
been proved by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes. -
But to the man advanced in
science it becomes only [deletion]one[/deletion]
[deletion]expression[/deletion] a collection of dependant
propositions.-
All the sciences moral metaphysical
& political can be nothing more than
a detail of facts or generalisations
or calculations concerning them by means
of the great & important engine
of language
