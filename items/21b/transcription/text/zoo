have been formed in the womb is
perhaps the great tangible idea of
the fluid in yeilding membranes
which have circumvolved the
foetus in the womb. - Perhaps
this is the conscious being the
undefinable something called [unclear]I[/unclear]
[unclear]round[/unclear] which the visible & tangible
ideas of organs rally after the
Child has made an entrance
into the world of visible agency.
The mass of the uterine feelings are
lost to us out of the power
of analysis we can only guess
at them; but like the first
feelings of the first years of the

They have acted their part in the
phaenomena of intellect. -
At the moment that the child enters
into the world new pains are
produced those of cold of respiration
of hard bodies - New pleasures visible
ones, pleasures of taste coalescence of
the uterine pleasures with the
maternal pleasures. pleasures of sound

by the pain of hunger connected with
the ideal pleasure of sucking.- -

from those pains anger is produced
[Horizontal rule]
for as Children have almost alway similar
impressions presented to them in infancy must
not these impressions be modified & conjoined

How the pain from a particular
posture may be preventing from
coalescing with the moral agents -
If a child when in pain has
by making any particular motions
with his hands had that pain
removed. He will learn to beat. -
when a child is pained by
disease, the pain should be
either counteracted by some pleasure
such as that of sucking or
it should be deconnected from
moral agents - or [insertion]connected with[/insertion] moral agents who
were only before connected with
[Vertical line] pleasure. a nurse when a child
is cross should endeavour to soothe
it & never beat it for in that
case the irrascible passions will
be rapidly raised. - What is
[/Vertical line] fortitude but the power of
modifying pain by pleasure -

In common education mathematical science
has been recommended not on account
of its application to the phaenomena
of the universe, but because it
produces in the mind a habit of
forming reasonings only upon the
bases of Known & obvious propositions
But the most pure most perfect logic
is useless unless it is made the
expression of facts: that mathematical
science is an expression of facts
[deletion]has been pro[/deletion] in its origin has
been proved by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Beddoes. -
But to the man advanced in
science it becomes only [deletion]one[/deletion]
[deletion]expression[/deletion] a collection of dependant
propositions.-
All the sciences moral metaphysical
& political can be nothing more than
a detail of facts or generalisations
or calculations concerning them by means
of the great & important engine
of language

In the infancy of intellectual existence &
even in the maturity of common life
the human being [deletion][unclear]as acted on[/unclear][/deletion] perceives
great & definite objects only. Hence his
feelings are connected with aggregates

as to causes. -

but likewise from the intimate
union subsisting between the

[deletion]to the perpetually occuring[/deletion] on

The building of houses & cities the

were not the impotent slaves
of blind & [deletion]uncertain[/deletion] unascertainable
laws existing in their

From accident then, or rather from
the occurrence of peculiar impressions
connected with voluntary motions
originated the [unclear]starting[/unclear] facts which
