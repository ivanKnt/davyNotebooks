            <lb/>
- Vegetables are possessed of a principal<lb/>

                rend="underline">laws</hi> different<lb/>
from those which govern common matter. Their<lb/>
functions however are modified by external agents;<lb/>
&amp; their living powers being exerted in a much<lb/>
more feeble manner than those of Animals<lb/>
are more immediately influenced by common<lb/>
natural changes. -<lb/>
- All Vegetables are produced from seed<lb/>
Their germination to growth depend upon the<lb/>
assimilation of new matter to their living parts.<lb/>
- They derive their nourishment from<lb/>
the soil in which they grow &amp; the Atmosphere<lb/>
by which they are surrounded. And that<lb/>
we may be able to judge of the manner in<lb/>
which this nourishment is subservient to<lb/>
their life it is necessary that we should first<lb/>
study the nature of the organs by which it<lb/>
is received &amp; modified &amp; the <hi xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

consequence of this circumstance the same<lb/>
