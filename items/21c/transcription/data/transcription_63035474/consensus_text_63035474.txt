where it would perhaps produce no advantages; for
the ashes of peats differ exceedingly in [underline]their nature[/underline]
& a great number contain substances of no efficacy
[underline]as manure[/underline]: but the [underline]ashes[/underline] of useful applica= =
=tion are easily known by a chemical process for
they are [underline]soluble[/underline] nearly altogether in weak aqua=
=fortis or in [underline]Muriatic acid[/underline]; whereas the peat ashes
that are defective in power are nearly insoluble. -
- Once more - The efficacy of Marle upon
certain lands is well known; but there are some
soils that it is not [underline]capable of improving[/underline]; To know
whether a soil would be improved by marle in
the common practice of Husbandry would require
a laborious & an expensive experiment; but the
chemical means of ascertaining the fact are very
simple. - If the soil does not effervesce when
vinegar is poured upon it We may be certain
that Marle will be useful; but there is
every reason to believe that it would have no
effect if there was a copious effervescence
& if as much as two thirds or even a half of
the soil becomes dissolved in the Acid. -
These circumstances are I trust sufficiently
strong to shew, the intimate & useful [underline]connection[/underline]
