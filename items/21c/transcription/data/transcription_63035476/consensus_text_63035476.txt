existing between [underline]Chemistry[/underline] & [underline]Agriculture[/underline]. And
it is fortunate for the extension of useful discovery,
that this [underline]connection[/underline] is founded upon very simple
[underline]principles[/underline] which may be [underline]easily acquired[/underline] & which
are almost independent of the more abstruse &
more complicated parts of the Science.
- The objects of the Chemistry of [underline]Agriculture[/underline]
are very simple & distinct & they may be easily
classed & arranged. -
- In the Natural order of enquiry the first
subject that presents itself is the Knowledge
of the Nature & composition of Soils, - of the
methods by which they may be distinguished
& of the conditions essential to fertility -
The discussion of the constitution of plants &
of the natural Agents to which they are subjected
properly follows - And on the comparison of
the constituent principles of vegetable matter;
with the constituent principles of Soils of water
& of Air, the general theory of the growth of
[underline]plants[/underline] is necessarily [underline]founded,[/underline] for all the organic
matter that they contain must be derived either
from the Land in which they grow or from the Atmos=
=phere by which they are surrounded. -
