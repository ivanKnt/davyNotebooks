have since altogether altered the methods,
the arrangements & the theories of [underline]the Science[/underline]
& have elevated it from a mere unconnected
series of facts to a noble & systematic
branch of Natural Science.-
- The effect, of the late progress of [underline]Chemistry[/underline]
in explaining the phenomena of the nourishment
& growth of plants was great & immediate -
D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestl[deletion]e[/deletion]y & M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Scheele about 1774 discovered
the composition of the atmosphere that it
consisted of two principal aerial fluids one
only of which supported flame" - This truth
at once laid open the theory of the agency of
[underline]air[/underline] upon plants & D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestly soon ascertained
"[underline]that plants absorbed carbonic acid[/underline]" or fixed
air & in the sunshine gave out pure air or
oxygene. -
- The knowledge of the composition
of water developed by [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish[/underline] in 1785
& of the constitution of fixed air ascertained
by Lavoisier served likewise to elucidate
the most important of the processes of vegetable
life. - [underline]Water[/underline], consists of inflammable air
