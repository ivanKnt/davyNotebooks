They give out by distillation volatile compounds,
the elements of which are pure air " inflammable

substance as that which forms a great part of
the Atmosphere & which is incapable of supporting
combustion. -
- These elements they gain either by their
leaves from the Air, or by their roots from the

during putrefaction are rendered either soluble
in water or aeriform - & in these states they
are capable of being assimilated to the vegetable
organs. - No one [underline]principle[/underline] affords, the
