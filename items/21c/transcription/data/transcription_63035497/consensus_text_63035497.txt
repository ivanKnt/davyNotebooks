pabulum of vegetable life - it is neither
charcoal nor hydrogene nor azote, nor
oxygene alone, but all of them together in
various states & various combinations. -
- The Theory of the general operation of
the more compound manures may be rendered
very obvious by simple chemical principles
but there is still much to be discovered [underline]with[/underline]
[underline]regard to the best methods[/underline] of rendering animal
& vegetable substances soluble; with regard
to the processes of decomposition how they may
be accelerated or retarded & the best means
of producing the greatest effects from the
materials employed. -
- The chemistry of the more simple
manures, the manures which act in very
small quantities such as Gypsum, the
alkalies & various saline substances is
far from being so well understood - These
substances are found however in minute
proportions in the greater number of plants
& probably may be essential to their Health
if not to their existence. - They probably
render the absolutely necessary food more nourishing
& act in a manner similar to that in which
