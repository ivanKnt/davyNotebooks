condiments act in the animal system. -
On this subject I shall be able to offer some
new experimental elucidations which I hope
will not be found unworthy your attention.-
- The ancient notion of the use of [underline]fallowing[/underline]
was that "the ground attracted some principles
from the atmosphere which rendered it fertile
- the chemical doctrine as derived from modern
discoveries - demonstrates that all its efficacy
is derived from the decomposition & fermen=
=tation of the vegetable matters which have
been burned beneath the surface; & which
become soluble & a good manure by the
action of [underline]Air & water[/underline]. -
- With regard to the true causes of the
advantages of paring & burning there is still
much to be discovered - It certainly often
destroys inert vegetable matter which
injured the texture of the soil & converts
it into manure; & it must materially
improve clayey lands & marles, by
furnishing a light & loose earth. -
- The true theory of the advantages of
[underline]irrigation[/underline] was known more than two centuries
