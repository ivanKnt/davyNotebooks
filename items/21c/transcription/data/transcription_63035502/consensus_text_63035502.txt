ago - Lord Bacon has delivered it in his
Natural History in the 17 section on Vegetation
"Meadow watering He says acts not only by supplying
useful moisture to the Grass; but likewise the
Water carries nourishment dissolved in it;
& by defending the Roots from the effects of cold."
- Slacked lime was used by the Romans
in manuring the soil in which fruit trees
grew - This we are informed of by Pliny;
[underline]Marle[/underline] had been employed by the Britons
& the Gauls from the earliest times as a
top dressing for Land "- but the precise
period in which [underline]burnt Lime[/underline] first came
into general use in the cultivation of Lands
is I believe unknown - The origin of the
application from the early practises is suf=
=ficiently obvious - a Substance which had
been used with success in gardening, must
have been soon tried in Farming; & in coun=
=tries where marle was not to be found
calcined Limestone would be naturally
tried as a [underline]substitute[/underline]. - .
- The elder writers on Agriculture had no
correct notions either of the nature of Lime
