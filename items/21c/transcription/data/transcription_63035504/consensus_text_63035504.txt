or Limestone, or marle or of their effects &
this was the necessary consequence of the imperfection
of the Chemistry of the Age. - Calcareous
Matter was considered by the Alchemists as a
peculiar earth; which in the fire became
combined with an inflammable acid &
Evelyn, & Hartlib & still later Lisle in
their works on Husbandry [underline]have characterised[/underline]
it merely as a [underline]hot[/underline] manure of use in [underline]cold[/underline]
[underline]lands[/underline]. -
- It is to D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black of Edinburgh that the
first & grand rudiments of our knowledge on
this subject are owing - About the year
1750 this illustrious Professor proved by the
most decisive Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. that Limestone & all
its modifications marbles, chalks & marles,
consist principally of a "peculiar Earth" united
to an aÃ«rial acid" - He shewed that their
effervescence in Vinegar is owing to the
loss of this acid - that it is given out in
burning - occasioning a loss of 40 p[superscript]r[/superscript] Cent" -
that the Lime in consequence becomes
caustic & is then as far as our knowledge
extends a single or elementary body." -
