- Amongst some specimens of Limestone
which were put into my hands by Lord Somerville
one called Black Pople Limestone from Somer=
=setshire was pointed out as peculiarly ex=
=cellent in Quality - By Analysis I found it
a magnesian Limestone containing likewise
Iron & manganese. - It loses more than
1/2 its weight by burning & as the Noble Lord
informed me had been used with the best effects
as a manure upon his Estate. - It would be
exceedingly curious and useful to ascertain whether
there is any peculiarity of composition in those
soils in Yorkshire where the Magnesian Limestone
is peculiarly detrimental. -
- I examined the soil of some fields in
Derbyshire where it was said to be successfully
used - They were clays not remarkably
stiff, & not effervescing with acids, so that
they contained very little calcareous matter -
Lime is generally used about Doncaster in very
large quantities & probably too extensive
an application is the cause of the bad effects
of the magnesian Limestone in this district;
for it is said there "that too much of the common
Lime cannot be applied to the Land," &
