enquiries the apparatus of that time was
wholly inadequate; Grew was an indefati=
=gable experimentalist but he wanted methods
& his labours on the composition of plants
though carried on with indefatigable zeal
& directed by extraordinary ingenuity are
now of little importance from the imperfection

of plants. -
