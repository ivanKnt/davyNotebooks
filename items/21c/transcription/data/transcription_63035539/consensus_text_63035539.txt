[underline]analogy[/underline] seems always to guide the con=

always to follow the execution. -
- I ought not to pass over the
Authors who have written on the Oe=
=conomy of Vegetation without noticing
the works of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Darwin - They claim
attention - some attention for their merits,
more for their former popularity. - "The
[underline]Zoonomia[/underline] The Laws of organic Life" contains
no observations on Vegetation which are
not likewise to be found in the [underline]Phytologia[/underline].
or the treatise on "the Laws of Vegetation,
Agriculture & Gardening. - Many of the
physiological details in this work are
very curious & interesting & D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Darwin
anticipated M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight in supposing
that the Vessels for containing the ascending
sap are peculiar tubes in the Alburnum.
- The chemical Theories of the Phytologia
do not however merit the same praise.
