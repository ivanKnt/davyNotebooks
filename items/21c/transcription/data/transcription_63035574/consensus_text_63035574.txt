[underline]Organs & Composition of Plants.[/underline]
- Vegetables are possessed of a principal
of life & they are acted upon by [underline]laws[/underline] different
from those which govern common matter. Their
functions however are modified by external agents;
& their living powers being exerted in a much
more feeble manner than those of Animals
are more immediately influenced by common
natural changes. -
- All Vegetables are produced from seed
Their germination to growth depend upon the
assimilation of new matter to their living parts.
- They derive their nourishment from
the soil in which they grow & the Atmosphere
by which they are surrounded. And that
we may be able to judge of the manner in
which this nourishment is subservient to
their life it is necessary that we should first
study the nature of the organs by which it
is received & modified & the [underline]principles[/underline] of
which they are composed. -
- The forms of vegetables are almost
infinitely diversified - yet the [underline]structure[/underline] of
such of them as have been accurately examined
is found in many respects analagous & in
