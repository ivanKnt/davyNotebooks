consequence of this circumstance the same
general reasonings may be applied in accounting
for the functions of the same species of organs
in different plants . -
- In every [underline]perfect vegetable[/underline] there are
found at least four distinct classes of organs
which though very different as to their size
& appearances are in some respects similar
in construction. The roots the trunk &
branches the leaves & the flower or seeds -
- The roots the trunk & branches are
chiefly alike as to original structure & they
are composed of analogous parts. -
- When the trunk of a tree is cut trans=
=versely there is perceived at least three dif=
=ferent bodies the bark the wood & the pith
& these bodies are again capable of a new
division -
- The bark when perfectly formed is covered
by a thin [underline]membrane[/underline] which as in the instance
of the [underline]Elder[/underline] may be easily separated & which
is called the [underline]epidermis[/underline] it is composed of a
number of small laminae or scales & in old
trees is found broken into parts at its surface. -
