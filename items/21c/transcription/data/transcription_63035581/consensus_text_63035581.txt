constitutes the concentric [underline]layers[/underline] which denote
by their number the age of the tree -
Instance
The pith or medulla in young trees & in
annual shoots is soft & full of juice but
in old trees it is dry & spongy - It is
composed of a number of cells & in its
living state its use is probably to supply
moisture to the vessels of the [underline]alburnum[/underline]
by the spinal tubes - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight has
shewn however that the presence of it is
not essential to the growth of plants, for it
was found in cases when it was removed
that vegetation was not materially impeded.
- In the [underline]roots[/underline] of [underline]trees[/underline] as may be
easily discovered by inspection there is the
same arrangement of parts as in the trunk
& branches. -
- The pores or vessels in the al=
=burnum extend to the minutest filaments
& in these filaments they appear to exert
their action in the moisture & nourishing
