has founded that admirable system of class=

form of a perfect science. -
- The greater number of [underline]flowers[/underline] are
fixed in a cup or [underline]Calyx[/underline] which is attached
to the flower stalk & which has been
supposed though erroneously to be a con=
=tinuation of the outer bark. -
- The [underline]Corolla[/underline] or [underline]petals[/underline] form in
most cases the base of the flower & in
the corolla are inserted the parts of
reproduction the organs essential to
the formation of seeds. -
- Most plants contain the stamina
& the pistil in one corolla. - but in
others they are arranged in separate cups
- and in a few cases they exist in distinct
plants. -
- The [underline]pistil[/underline] is the basis of the [underline]seed[/underline]
in all plants but that it may be con=
=verted into the seed it is necessary
