In consequence of this obscure & singular agency
its form gradually changes & it is at last
converted into the seed vessel. -
- In cases when the pistil & stamina
are seated in one corolla the pollen is
immediately deposited upon the [underline]pistil[/underline] by
contact, but in the instances in which they
are separated from each other no im=
=pregnation takes place unless the fecun=
=datory dust has been carried upon the
seminal parts by winds or by other causes
& it often happens as for instance in the
case of the [underline]female date[/underline] trees that [underline]blossoms[/underline]
are [underline]produced[/underline] but no fruits till male-
trees are brought in their vicinity. -
- The seeds of plants are infolded
in different membranes & when the corolla
& stamina have disappeared after per=
=forming their necessary functions they
are discovered in the place of the [underline]base[/underline]
of the [underline]pistil[/underline]. -
