Earthy matter & in some of the seeds & Grasses
almost the whole of the exterior part of this
Membrane is siliceous earth. -
- In the Calamus Rotang or common
[underline]Rattan[/underline] the glossy substance that invelopes
the bark is flint almost pure & by striking
two plants of this kind together in the dark
sparks of light are perceived. -
- Silex likewise abounds in the
epidermis of rushes & even of grasses & the
peculiar roughness of the surfaces of their
 stalks is owing to this substance. -
- If a stalk of corn be carefully
burnt in a crucible the Earthy matter will
be seen retaining the form of the epidermis
& [space left for word to be inserted] in its appearance. - And
in all those vegetables which are hollow
internally the siliceous earth not only
acts by defending their tender barks from
external injury but serves to support &
to strengthen & may be considered as in
some measure analogous in its purposes to
the earthy matter in the shells of different
animals. -
