discovered to be precisely similar in its
properties to the substance obtained by
passing pure inflammable air or hydrogene
over charcoal heated red. - It is beleived
to be a combination of Hydrogene & Carbon
& it is usually called [underline]Hydrocarbonate[/underline] -
 - The elements of plants then gained by
destructive distillation as is evident from
these observations are extremely few & their
nature is [underline]easily understood[/underline]. -
- [underline]Results[/underline] proving the same general facts
are gained from the Combustion of vegetable
matter in the open Atmosphere & by defla=
=gration of them with Nitre or with the
salt called oxymuriate of Potash which
contains an immense quantity of oxygene or
pure [underline]air[/underline] -
[underline]Instance glass bell[/underline]
- In this case water carbonic acid &
a little incombustible gas only are evolved
& a dense charcoal remains in the vessel. -
- The experiments might be diversified in a
variety of manners but the products would
be analogous in their nature though different
