in quantity in different instances. -
- By no methods of investigation can
absolute certainty be obtained in physical
[underline]science[/underline] but all the phenomena seem to
concur in shewing that the various parts
& organs of plants are constituted by different
arrangements & chemical combinations of a
few simple principles which are for the
most part oxygene or the base of pure
air hydrogene or inflammable air &
carbon or pure charcoal & different
earthy & alkaline [underline]substances[/underline]. -
- This conclusion at first view appears
extraordinary but it is countenanced by
the great science of chemical facts. -
- Even in our common processes we are
capable of producing a very great diversity
of compounds by the different union of
two or three bodies. -
- In these cases solids become fluids
& fluids are partly converted into gasses &
a variety of changes are almost [underline]instantaneously[/underline]
produced. -
