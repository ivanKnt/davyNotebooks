- It is evident from the combustion of
sulphur that the Nitrogene in the Atmos=
=phere considerably exceeds the oxygene in
quantity but this process is not the most
accurate for the Analysis as a little new
aÃ«riform substance is produced in it which
requires some time before it is dissolved by water.
And that we may know precisely the composition
of Air it is necessary that we burn in it some
inflammable body which will absorb the whole
of the [underline]oxygene[/underline] & form with it only solid matter
such a body is [underline]phosphorus[/underline]. -
- When phosphorus is burnt in air in a
manner similar to sulphur it is found that the
absorption is 1/5 which corresponds to the [underline]Nitrogene[/underline].
100 parts in volume of Air contain about one
part of Carbonic Acid 20 or 21 parts of oxygene
gas & 78 or 79 parts of [underline]Nitrogene[/underline] & contain
diffused through their pores a certain quantity
of water. - The fact of the existence of water
in [underline]Air[/underline] in the form of invisible vapour or of
dissolved moisture is shewn by many very simple
experiments. -
- When pearlash or any very soluble salt is
exposed to the atmosphere it soon increases in
