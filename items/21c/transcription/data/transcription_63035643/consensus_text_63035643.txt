weight & becomes moist even in the driest
weather & this is owing to its abstracting the
invisible moisture existing in the [underline]Air[/underline]. -
- Likewise when we expose water in small
quantities upon a large surface it speedily
disappears particularly in warm weather
& this depends upon its being diffused through
the Elastic fluid in contact with it. -
- All the phenomena of evaporation
depend upon the power which water possesses
of being rendered elastic in the Air & dew
Rain & snow are occasioned by its deposition
which is generally owing to a diminution of
the Heat in the upper strata of the Atmosphere
as moisture is much more diffusible through
warm than through cold air. -
- In [underline]the Hottest[/underline] weather of [underline]Summer &[/underline]
[underline]when[/underline] the Atmosphere is [underline]fully saturated[/underline] with
moisture in our climate, according to the
experiments of de Saussure it never it never contains
more than 1/20 of its weight of water & in the
coldest & driest weather never less than 1/60. -
- Besides the permanently elastic parts of
Air which are found throughout the whole
of its extent - the Atmosphere often contains
solid & fluid matter which are raised
