in its composition; but the soil is almost
infinitely diversified with regard to its con=
=stituent [underline]parts[/underline]. -
- That we may be enabled to understand
fully the chemical History of soils & of their
changes it is necessary that our examination
should commence with their composition -
their origin & their primitive states; & it is
likewise necessary that [underline]we should[/underline] trace
[underline]the causes of their[/underline] natural [underline]modifications[/underline].
- ( In all countries by penetrating to a
certain distance below the surface - Hard
stony strata or Rocks are discovered -
Generally they occur a very few feet beneath
the soil & are rarely so deep as 100 fathom, -
- All known rocks when exposed to
the atmosphere to moisture & to the
changes of Heat & cold gradually
decompose & sooner or later according as
their nature differs, become a finely divided
earthy matter. -
