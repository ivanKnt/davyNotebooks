[underline]Instances Win or Basalt[/underline]
On Mountains & in plains the Natural Soil is
usually of the same Chemical Nature as the stratum
on which it rests; but in vallies, where torrents
have acted, or where the sea has retired from the Land.
there is usually a mixture of materials & the surface
contains ingredients derived from various sources; -
& in some cases whole strata when not of great
thickness have been converted into finely divided
Earth -
- The number of the species of Rocks which
existing in great masses from the known interior
strata of the globe is not very considerable &
they are associated together in different Countries -
in similar arrangements. -
- The [underline]soils[/underline] into which their upper surfaces
have decomposed are easily distinguished from
each other & they form what may be called the
primitive Species -
- The classes Rocks & Strata most commonly
found below the surface or forming parts of it
are [underline]10[/underline] in number - [underline]Sandstone Limestone[/underline],
