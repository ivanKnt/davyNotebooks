a few centuries a bog or a morass appears
where a flourishing wood or forest had
before existed. -
- That this is a History & not a visionary
detail is evident from all the facts in our
possession - All the great Bogs in Britain
& in Ireland are evidently the remains of
forests: & parts of decayed trees are always
found in them & there are no Bogs in any of
those countries, where the forests have remained
untouched & in their natural state
- The idea that peat is in a constant state of
increase does not militate against this opinion
- The [underline]peat soil[/underline] though unfit in its natural
state for trees or edible grasses, yet supports a
variety of shrubs of mosses & even of Heaths -
& from this successive decay & reproduction of these
plants new matter is almost constantly adding
to it; - so that it is not extraordinary that
peat of many feet in thickness should be pro=
=duced or renovated in a bog in the course of
a few years. -
- From what I have said of [underline]peat[/underline] a conclusion
follows not altogether unprofitable -
