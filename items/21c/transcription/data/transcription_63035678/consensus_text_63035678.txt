decomposition of the plants -
- The Earthy Matter of peats is uniformly
analogous to that of the stratum on which
they repose - the plants which have formed
them must have derived the Earths that they
contained from this stratum; Thus in Wiltshire
& Berkshire; where the stratum below the peat
is chalk Calcareous Earth abounds in the ashes
& very little alumine & silex - They likewise
contain much oxide of Iron & gypsum both of
which may be derived from the pyrites so abundant
in chalk -
- Different specimens of Peat that I
have burnt from the granitic & shiston Soils
of diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. parts of these islands have always
given ashes principally siliceous & aluminous -
- And a specimen of peat from the County of
Antrim gave ashes which afforded very nearly
the same constituents as the great Basaltic
stratum of the [underline]Country[/underline]. -
- A due proportion between the earthy
& the organisable parts of the soil is essential
to fertility; - but as the earthy ingredients differ
in their Nature so likewise the vegetable matter
differ; - Dry & hard fibres of plants may
