injure a soil even if in the smallest quantities
& render it necessary to pare & burn - whilst
a fine light black vegetable mould mixed in

the texture & increase its nutritive powers. -
- The Nature of the Earths in the soil &
their absorbent powers; & their proportions
must materially affect the agency of the vegetable
matter -
- Thus a dry fine sand would bear much
more vegetable earth than a stiff clay or

- The vegetable matter in soils not only

atmosphere & retaining it to preserve its roots
in a proper state of moisture - & for this
effect its agencies are combined with those
of the [underline]earths[/underline] -
