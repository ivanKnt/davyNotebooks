- The Earths are absorbent in the following order
Alumine, Carbonate of Lime Carbonate of Magnesia
Silex; which comes far behind all the others - I have
found that 100 grains of dry alumine after being
heated red will gain in dry weather by exposure
to air 5 grains in 24 hours - Carb: of Lime
about 3 Grains - Carb: of Magnesia 2 1/2 [underline]Gas[/underline] &
Silex less than 1 grain -
- [underline]Of course[/underline] the reason is plain why siliceous
soils will bear much more vegetable matter -
(They require it to be brought to a due retentive
power for moisture. whilst aluminous &
calcareous Soils are fertile with much
smaller quantities. -
- I have made analysis of Lime [underline]Soils[/underline] which
are exceedingly fertile without containing
much vegetable matter; & which are pro=
=ductive without manure & in all cases -
(They have not been many indeed but sufficient
to establish the point - the combined sum of the
aluminous & calcareous Earth has always
exceeded, that of the [underline]siliceous[/underline]. -
