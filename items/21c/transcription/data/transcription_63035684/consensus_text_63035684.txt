beans without manure ( as I have mentioned
in a paper on "the Analysis of Soils" ) - I
found to consist of 1/9 of sand 8/9 of marle 5/100

complete analysis of the marle which contains
76/100 Lime & 20/100 Alumine rem[superscript]r[/superscript]. iron & silex. -
- A Celebrated Soil from in East
Lothian gives results the same as to the main
question. it seems to have resulted from the
decomposition of aluminous stones - An analysis
made with all the correctness I could attain
gave me 11p[superscript]r[/superscript]. Cent Lime 25 of sand 45 of clay
53 alumine & an exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. on the whole gave 9 vege=

- Besides the dependence of the absorbent
powers of Soils upon a due mixture of the
vegetable & earthy constituent parts - there
is another agency between them of a chemical
Nature - ( All finely divided vegetable
matter in its decomposing state furnishes
constituent parts capable of uniting with
the Earths - Silex has least attraction.
Carbonate of Magnesia is next in order &
Alumine & Carb: of Lime exert very strong
affinities - Manures in consequence
are soonest exhausted in siliceous Soils by the
action of vegetation & by the decomposing
