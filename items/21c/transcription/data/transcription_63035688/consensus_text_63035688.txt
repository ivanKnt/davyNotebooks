entire soil I found in it 54 parts of silex - &
only 28 of Alumine 3 of carbonate of Lime &
5 oxide of Iron. -
- The standard of the fertility of Soils for
different plants must however vary with
the climate; & must be particularly influ=
=enced by the quantity of rain -
- The power of soils to absorb moisture ought
to be much greater in warm or dry countries
than in cold or moist ones. & the quantity
of aluminous Earth they contain greater -
Soils likewise on declivities ought to be more
absorbent than in plains or in the bottom of
vallies: Their productiveness likewise is
influenced by the nature of the sub-soil
or the stratum on which they rest -
When Soils are immediately situated upon a
bed of rock or stone, they are much sooner
rendered dry by evaporation than where the
subsoil is of clay or marle; & as has been
very justly observed by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Young "a prime
cause of the great fertility of the land in the
moist climate of Ireland is the proximity
