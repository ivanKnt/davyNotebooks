- A Clayey subsoil will sometimes render a
fertile or sandy [underline]Soil[/underline] & in this case it will
retain moisture in such a manner as to be
capable of supplying, that last by the earth
above in consequence of the action of the
dry atmosphere, upon it. -
- A sandy or a gravelly subsoil often
corrects the imperfections of too great a degree
of tenacity & absorbent power in the true soil. -
- In calcareous Countries the Soil is often
found only a few inches above the Limestone
& its fertility is not impaired by the nearness
of the rock though in a less absorbent [underline]soil[/underline]
this situation would occasion barreness;
& the sandstone & Limestone Hills - in Derbyshire
& N. Wales may be easily distinguished at a
distance by the difference of the vegetation -
the Limestone Hills are Green - The Sandstone
Hills brown - Instance. & the simple
method of improving the sandstone Hills would
be to bring Lime to them. -
