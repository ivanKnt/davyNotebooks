Lecture 4.
[underline]Manures[/underline]
- In this lecture I shall endeavour to explain
the principles of the nature & agency of Manures -
& the best methods of applying them - I shall
principally confine myself to chemical considerations.-
- Plants are capable of growing by the [underline]mere[/underline]
[underline]agency[/underline] of Water & of [underline]Air[/underline]; But as I mentioned
in the first lecture the exp.[superscript]ts[/superscript] of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Woodward fully
prove "that in cases when the water is pure
i.e. holds no foreign matters in solution vegetation
is exceedingly feeble " -
- This fact has been shewn more recently by
the researches of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hassenfratz - His paper may
be found in the "[underline]Annales de Chimie[/underline]" He
made diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. seeds grow & - & He found that
when the water was pure - they were always sickly
& puny & never produced perfect seeds
My Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
- Turnip seeds in in a soil containing only
the pure Earths watered with distilled water -
The other the same earths with 4 tea teaspoonfulls
of nearly as [underline]3[/underline] to [underline]4[/underline]. -
- A certain proportion of Nutritive matter
must be supplied to plants from the soil
