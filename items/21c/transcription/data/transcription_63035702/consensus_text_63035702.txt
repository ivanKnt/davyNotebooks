unaltered states - Mucilage, Sugar & Gelly
may be procured in solution from almost all
plants; & Extractive matters. Tanning prin=
=ciple. & Gallic acid from the parts of trees
but these substances till they have been submitted
for some time to the action of Air so as to have
undergone a change in their nature seem to
have no beneficial effect - I made an exp.[superscript]t[/superscript]
last year on the effect of these substances in their
pure states & I shall mention the facts &
the general results - I watered from the
14 - to 26 of May some plants of Mint & some
common meadow grass planted in diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. pots,
in garden earths respectively with weak solutions
of the diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. substances that have been named -
& one pot of grass was watered with a solution
of all of them:
Tanning principle Extractive matter
Mucilage, Gelly Sugar Tanning princi[insertion]ple[/insertion]
gallic acid extractive matter.
The effect was certainly pernicious -
parts of the solutions not consumed in these
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. were suffered to remain exposed to Air
till Sept[superscript]r[/superscript]. 5[superscript]th[/superscript] when they had all fermented
changed in colour & acquired a strong musty
smell - I employed them in this state a
fortnight upon pots of Earth filled in this same
way - & they all increased the growth of the
grass except the solutions of extractive matter
