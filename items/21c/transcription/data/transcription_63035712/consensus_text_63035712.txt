Pond weeds, the parings of Hedges & ditches, &
sea-weed all ought to be used as soon as possible,
& in these points the best practise (I believe)
accords with Scientific principle. - ( On the
coast of Cornwall & Devonshire Sea weeds are used
in large quantities particularly as a dressing for
Barley. - the ancient practice was to collect
them in the autumn & winter & make them
into a [space for insertion] with sand - & they were suffered
to remain many months before they were applied -
- Of late years they have ploughed them in fresh.
- & I was informed by some of the most Intelli=
=gent Farmers on the Coast the year before last
that they found the effect of fresh weeds
much greater than an equal quantity of the
fermented weeds -
- Dry, hard & compact Vegetable substances
which contains little soluble matter or which
have been deprived of it by the agency of [underline]Water[/underline]
absolutely require preparation to be rendered
efficient manures & it is necessary that some
substances should be mixed with them to begin
the work of fermentation - Of this kind
are [underline]peat spent Bark chips of wood, Sawdust[/underline]
