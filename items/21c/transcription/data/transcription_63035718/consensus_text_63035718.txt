& it wholly decomposes in a few months & when
applied as manure serves only for a single crop -
- Green crops contain infinitely more volatile
than coaly matter in the proportion at least
of from between 20 & 30 to 1 - Rye grass
distilled gave me in the 100 parts only 4 of coaly
residuum. - Clover gave 7 - Peats gave from
1/8 to 1/5 of their weight of residuum - & Oak &
Chesnut sawdust about 1/5 - 100 parts of deal
sawdust gave me 16 of charcoal. -
- [underline]Animal Substances[/underline] in general are much
more liable to decompose than any of the
Vegetable substances - [underline]Their constitution[/underline] is
more complicated & the play of attractions
by which it is produced more easily disturbed;
- Animal substances contain Nitrogene in consi=
=derable proportions - all furnish volatile
alkali by distillation - & give in their
residuum phosphate of Lime & Iron - The
other circumstances of composition are similar
to those of Vegetable matter - Hydrogene &
Oxygene & Charcoal, are their predominant
elements -
- No depth of thought is required to explain
how animal matter can become the food of
plants - Easily susceptible of change it
