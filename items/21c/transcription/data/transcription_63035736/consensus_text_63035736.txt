M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Young in some exp[superscript]ts[/superscript],, made in 1804 & of
which an account is published in the 253 N[superscript]o[/superscript].
of A A states that he found [underline]gypsum[/underline] or
sulphate of Lime beneficial [underline]to Turnips[/underline]
in a soil consisting of 136 grains of sand
& 364 of Clay -
- In examining the ashes of Turnips of
the entire plant in several instances, I
found always a certain proportion of gypsum
& in one instance very nearly 1/17 part. -
- Gypsum is considered generally as useful
in [underline]Clover & sainfoin[/underline]
Ashes of cloves 1/5 Ashes of sainfoin 1/3
I am inclined to believe it a food. -
- The peat ash of Stockbridge which is very
much used as a top dressing upon Grass land
contains nearly one half of its weight of Gypsum,
- Gypsum is not an uncommon substance in
soils (& it would be an interesting problem
to ascertain whether those lands on which it
is most efficacious are such as are deficient
in it & whether those on which it produces
no effect are not such as already contain it
in abundance
