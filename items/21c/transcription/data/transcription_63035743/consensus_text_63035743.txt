may act as a stimulus on the vegetable organs. -
In time likewise it must be decomposed by
the calcareous Earth in soils & in this case it
would furnish an oxide of Iron whilst the
acid united to lime would compose gypsum. -
- Peats differ very considerably as the
ashes that they give & would consequently
produce very diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. effects in diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. cases. -
- Lord Charleville found much [underline]sulphate[/underline]
[underline]of Potash or vitriolised Tartar[/underline] in some Irish peat. -
- I found in some specimens of peat from [underline]near[/underline]
[underline]Lochness[/underline] much aluminous earth & some
oxide of Iron. -
- The Hampshire peat contains much
Gypsum & a little oxide of Iron. - And
the Berkshire peat-ashes of which I have
analyzed three diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. specimens afford a
very large quantity of [underline]oxide of Iron[/underline] a
certain proportion of gypsum & a small
quantity of mild lime & of muriate of Potash
& sulphate of Potash -
- I found in 100 parts of peat ash from the
pits belonging to C Dundas Esq[superscript]r[/superscript]. about 32 Gypsum [insertion]48 oxide of Iron[/insertion]
