These ashes are always used in the Countries where
they are found upon calcareous Soils & they make
an excellent top dressing -
- Upon marles & stiff soils as much as 20
Bushels to the Acre are sometimes used; But upon
light Lands from 10 to 16 Bushels -
- The best red ashes sells for about 7 [superscript]d[/superscript] a Bushel
the whiter ashes which contain more gypsum &
Calcareous matter are reckoned less valuable
& sell for as low as 4[superscript]d[/superscript] & 6[superscript]d[/superscript] - There can
be no doubt that the iron in these ashes is
useful in vegetation -
- I have already mentioned the fertility of
some calcareous red soils. -
- In examining the soil of a field near
Newbury to which the proprietor was about to
apply peat ash by muriatic Acid & prussian
Alkali - I found that there was very little
blue precipitate & consequently very little iron
in the land - Oxide of Iron is found in
the ashes of all plants & may in consequence
of its affinities enable them to attract a larger
quantity of organisable matter from the soil
