- In loose yellow or red lands which abound
in this [underline]substance[/underline] the application of new quan=
=tities would there is every reason to believe
be very [underline]hurtful[/underline] but in chalks & hard dense
& cold Clays which are almost defective
in Iron its application we may conceive
would be [underline]almost always useful[/underline]. -
- I made last year at [underline]Roehampton[/underline] an
exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. on the efficacy of oxide of Iron on [underline]wheat[/underline]
The soil contained about 5[underline]P Cent[/underline] of oxide of iron
& consisted of three parts of sand & one of
light clay - Three square yards were
selected which had been sown [underline]with wheat[/underline]
a full half pound of oxide of Iron was divided
into three equal parts one part was raked
into the [underline]ground alone[/underline] - Another part
was mixed with 4 [unclear]xxx[/unclear] lime - the third with
[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of Magnesia - & a square yard was
selected which had no manure this was done
in the beginning of [underline]December[/underline] - at the beginning
of April the wheat with iron & magnesia
was [underline] the leaves yellow[/underline]. That with
Iron & lime was greener & better. -
That with Iron alone nearly the same.
