50 parts Lime. -
- The Nature of Limestone may be proved
by compounding as well as by decompounding.
Quicklime is soluble in water & if a solution of
quicklime be poured into a bottle filled with

which is the same as pure powdered marble - &
which is insoluble in water unless that water
be impregnated by the same acid that forms
a part of it. -
- The calcareous substance of rocks is called
