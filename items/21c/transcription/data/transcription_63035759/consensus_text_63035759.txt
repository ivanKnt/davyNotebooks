of Carbonic acid & Lime [underline]carbonate of Lime[/underline]. -
- Carbonate of Lime when pure is perfectly
white & has uniform qualities - Its specific
gravity is to that of water as 27 [underline]to 10.[/underline] &
in Nature it occurs in crystals having a
form that may always be resolved into the
Rhomboid. -
- Rocks of pure carbonate of Lime are
exceedingly rare - (In the chemical operations
by which the surface of the globe has been
formed, or modified (it has usually been
crystallised or consolidated in masses with
other substances from which the varieties of
colour, weight & hardness of calcareous stones
are derived. -
- The colouring matter of Limestone is
in almost all cases the oxide of Iron, now &

as to be difficultly scratched with a knife
& long in being acted upon by acids the pro=
=perties are generally owing to the presence of
aluminous & siliceous earth & when it is
