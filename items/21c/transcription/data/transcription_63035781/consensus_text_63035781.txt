- The Magnesian Limestone requires less
Heat & less expenditure of coals than the common
Limestones & loses from 53 to 60 p[superscript]r[/superscript] Cent. -

these limestones is owing. -
- When Limestones contain much aluminous
or siliceous earth the fire for burning should
never be suffered to rise to white Heat; for
