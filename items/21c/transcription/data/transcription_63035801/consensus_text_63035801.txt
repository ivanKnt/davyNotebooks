them - In this state the seed is prepared
for germination supplied with [underline]Heat[/underline] & with
[underline]moisture[/underline] it requires only [underline]Atmospherical Air[/underline] to
enable it to evolve its [underline]infant organs[/underline]. -
- If a moistened seed be brought in contact
with a portion of the Atmosphere confined in a
proper vessel it is found that at the time
of sprouting a certain quantity of pure Air
or [underline]oxygene[/underline] is absorbed & that a little
fixed Air or Carbonic Acid is given out by it.
- No germination takes place in vacuo.
in Carbonic Acid, inflammable air, or any
of the airs that do not contain free [underline]oxygene[/underline]
- The first distinct mark of perfect germination
is the development of the [underline]radicle[/underline]. - It may
be distinctly seen in the Garden bean & in the
[underline]Kidney bean[/underline] in cases when they have been
exposed to the proper circumstances in this
stage of the process we examine the Cotyledons
they are found to be considerably enlarged
& by means of a microscope several vessels
may be perceived in them connected with
