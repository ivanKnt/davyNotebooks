& that were estimated at 576. 840 grains. -
- In wheat which has been sown in
the spring the same process of germination
takes place, but as there is no accumulation
of saccharine matter in the plumula
ready to produce new organised parts the
grain is seldom so fair & full. But, Though
a number of grains of spring wheat will
not weight nearly so much as an equal
number of grains of winter wheat yet the
real quantity of [underline]nutritive matter[/underline] in equal
weights in some instances seems to be greatest
in spring grain. -
- At the request of Sir J Banks I made
an analysis of two specimens of wheat -
one of the finest & fullest of the winter grain
of 1804 - The other of the spring grain -
100 parts of the [underline]winter wheat[/underline] gave 19 gluten
& about - 75 Starch
The Spring Wheat gave 24 gluten
& - 68 or 9 Starch
And gluten is the most nutritive part
