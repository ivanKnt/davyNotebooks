in the Phil: Trans. -
- The sap may be traced in its
progress through the alburnum towards
the leaves - For if at the time of the
rising of the sap a number of orifices be
made in the tree, the sap first begins
to flow from the lowest opening - then
from the lowest but one, (& so on succes=
=sively, till at last it makes its appear=
=ance in the highest of all - And
when Bonnet made plants grow in coloured
liquids the tinging matter which was
deposited in the wood appeared first
in the lowest part of the alburnum, &
gradually ascended higher & higher till
at last it reached the top of the tree
& tinged even the extremities of the leaves. -
- The rise of the sap in trees depends
partly upon capillary attraction; But
the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales though made with a very
diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. end shew that this power alone is
not sufficient to elevate it to a considerable
height above the vessels. -
