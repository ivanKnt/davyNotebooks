sap was ascertained to hold in solution
chiefly mucilage & saline matter - And
in the Elm & the Beech it was likewise
united to astringent substances. - All
these saps when exposed for some time to Air
were found to have deposited [underline]solid matter[/underline]
- The general tendency of some of the
constituent principles of the sap to solidify
is proved indeed by many diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. experiments.
- Mucilage Tannin or the astringent prin=
=ciples or even certain of the vegetable acids
when exposed to the oxygene of the air
slowly unite to it & are converted into
substances analagous to woody fibre. -
- In our artificial processes by applying
oxygene in a form of fluid [underline]combination[/underline] to
a vegetable [underline]juice[/underline]; we in almost all cases
occasion a considerable deposition of solid
matter
Instance vegetable matter of the Oak
[underline]Nitrous acid[/underline]
- These facts are extremely applicable to the
modification which the sap undergoes in the
[underline]Alburnum[/underline]. -
