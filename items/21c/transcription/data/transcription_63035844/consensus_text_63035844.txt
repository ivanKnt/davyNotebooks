of the leaf as the surface by which moisture
is perspired ( but it appears from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
Bonnet that under certain circumstances this

- When a plant is exposed to a fastidious
atmosphere containing a certain proportion of
carbonic acid, being under proper circumstances
with regard to Heat & light it is found
after a certain time that a part of the
carbonic acid is absorbed; but the oxygene
gas is not diminished. -
- In the direct beams of the Sun the
leaves of plants appear to absorb water &
carbonic acid by their under surface &
give out oxygene gas -
- If we immerse a living plant under
water the production of oxygene gas will
be seen to take place from the surfaces of
its leaves; & if the water be saturated
with carbonic acid the effect will be
much increased -
