- It would appear that in the process
of the Healthy vegetation of leaves the water
& carbonic acid received from the atmosphere
united to the principles conveyed by the sap
were partly deprived of oxygene in the
parynchyma by the agency of light; &
rendered more proper to be converted into
inflammable products - And by the
beautiful process of the decomposition of
water & carbonic acid not only carbon &
hydrogene are furnished to [underline]plants[/underline]. but
oxygene gas a principle absorbed in their
germination is supplied again to the [underline]Atmosphere[/underline]
- When a plant is kept for a considerable
length of time in darkness or a very shady
place it is found to render the air in
contact with it in a slight degree impure. -
- It becomes by degrees diseased & gives out
carbonic acid that substance which in
health was an essential part of its nourishment
- In a state of disease produced by a defi=
=ciency of light the leaves & branches lose their
green colour & become white or yellow a
small quantity of inflammable matter only
