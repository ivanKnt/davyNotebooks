            - Vegetables are possessed of a principal<br xml:id="">
            of life &amp; they are acted upon by <em class="underline">laws</em> different<br xml:id="">
            from those which govern common matter. Their<br xml:id="">
            functions however are modified by external agents;<br xml:id="">
            &amp; their living powers being exerted in a much<br xml:id="">
            more feeble manner than those of Animals<br xml:id="">
            are more immediately influenced by common<br xml:id="">
            natural changes. -<br xml:id="">
            - All Vegetables are produced from seed<br xml:id="">
            Their germination to growth depend upon the<br xml:id="">
            assimilation of new matter to their living parts.<br xml:id="">
            - They derive their nourishment from<br xml:id="">
            the soil in which they grow &amp; the Atmosphere<br xml:id="">
            by which they are surrounded. And that<br xml:id="">
            we may be able to judge of the manner in<br xml:id="">
            which this nourishment is subservient to<br xml:id="">
            their life it is necessary that we should first<br xml:id="">
            study the nature of the organs by which it<br xml:id="">
            is received &amp; modified &amp; the <em class="underline">principles</em> of<br xml:id="">
            which they are composed. -<br xml:id="">
            - The forms of vegetables are almost<br xml:id="">
            infinitely diversified - yet the <em class="underline">structure</em> of<br xml:id="">
            such of them as have been accurately examined<br xml:id="">
            is found in many respects analagous &amp; in<br xml:id="">
