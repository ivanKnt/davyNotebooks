[underline]Lecture[/underline] 1.
At this period, & before such an Assembly it will be
wholly unnecessary it would be indecorous even to offer
[underline]arguments[/underline] in [underline]favour[/underline] of the cultivation of any branch of
Knowledge that can tend to improve Agriculture.
- The connection of [underline]Chemistry[/underline] with this most important
of the Arts has long been felt & acknowledged by all
enlightened Cultivators - Chemistry is justly regarded
as laying the foundation; for the most refined scien=
=tific principles belonging to the subject; & is in a
[underline]high degree[/underline] capable of useful applications to the
practical Methods of the Farmer. -
- Chemical Science has for its end the explanation
of the intimate properties & constitution of bodies &
their effects upon each other: & the means that it
employs are experiments in which the different substances
are made to exhibit their mutual agencies & the changes
that they undergo. -
- The knowledge of the [underline]process of Vegetation[/underline] is of
great importance in Agriculture; But this knowledge
cannot be obtained unless the nature of the food of
Plants be discovered, the [underline]influence of Soils[/underline] upon their
Roots; the effects of Air & Light, & dews upon their leaves
be ascertained; & the constitution of the sap in its different

[page]4|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00004|dnp21c002pp|63035470[/page]
states known; & these are immediate objects of Chemical
Science & can be developed only by methods of Analysis.
- [underline]In the operations of Husbandry[/underline], there are
many immediate benefits to be derived from an
acquaintance with the experimental processes for
ascertaining the composition of Bodies. - Thus,
they offer easy methods of discovering, what is
most [underline]likely to be the effects[/underline] of a [underline]new manure,[/underline]
upon what Soils it will be most efficacious;
& how far its power may be counteracted or increased
by other substances They enable us to ascertain
the relative nutritive powers of different plants;
& to detect the causes of the fertility & of the bar=
=renness [underline]of Soils[/underline]. -
- Instances perhaps are always more inter=
=esting than general propositions. it would be
easy to bring forward [underline]very numerous ones[/underline] of such
applications of the Science; but I shall at present
content myself with stating a very few. -
- Any Gentleman who happened to find a
Limestone Quarry upon his estate, which burnt
into strong Lime & [underline]made[/underline] good mortar, might
if unacquainted with chemical principles at

[page]5|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00005|dnp21c003pp|63035472[/page]
3
once conclude; that it would likewise make an excellent
Manure & in consequence might apply it on a great
extent to [underline]his Land[/underline]; & might be exceedingly
[underline]disappointed[/underline] in finding that it injured [underline]the Soil[/underline]
& destroyed Vegetation for many years; which
would certainly take place if it happened to
be the [underline]Magnesian Limestone[/underline]; which though
it has all the [underline]common[/underline] indications of [underline]Limestone[/underline]
proper for [underline]manure[/underline], is distinguished from it in
a moment by a single [underline]chemical experiment[/underline].
The Magnesian [underline]Limestone[/underline] when thrown into Aqua=
fortis or even into strong Vinegar dissolves very
slowly indeed whilst the common dissolves
with [underline]rapidity[/underline] & makes an effervescence
twenty times [underline]as great[/underline]. -
- Again, A person who happened
to have abundance of peat Land & who was
acquainted with the use of the Berkshire
[underline]peatash[/underline] as a manure, & with the profits
of the proprietors of the Berkshire [underline]peat district[/underline]
might immediately suppose (if he had not
studied the nature of the [underline]Substance[/underline]) that
his peat would produce similar [underline]effects;[/underline]
& might begin to burn it & to apply it [underline]to his Land.[/underline]

[page]6|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00006|dnp21c004pp|63035474[/page]
where it would perhaps produce no advantages; for
the ashes of peats differ exceedingly in [underline]their nature[/underline]
& a great number contain substances of no efficacy
[underline]as manure[/underline]: but the [underline]ashes[/underline] of useful applica= =
=tion are easily known by a chemical process for
they are [underline]soluble[/underline] nearly altogether in weak aqua=
=fortis or in [underline]Muriatic acid[/underline]; whereas the peat ashes
that are defective in power are nearly insoluble. -
- Once more - The efficacy of Marle upon
certain lands is well known; but there are some
soils that it is not [underline]capable of improving[/underline]; To know
whether a soil would be improved by marle in
the common practice of Husbandry would require
a laborious & an expensive experiment; but the
chemical means of ascertaining the fact are very
simple. - If the soil does not effervesce when
vinegar is poured upon it We may be certain
that Marle will be useful; but there is
every reason to believe that it would have no
effect if there was a copious effervescence
& if as much as two thirds or even a half of
the soil becomes dissolved in the Acid. -
These circumstances are I trust sufficiently
strong to shew, the intimate & useful [underline]connection[/underline]

[page]7|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00007|dnp21c005pp|63035476[/page]
5
existing between [underline]Chemistry[/underline] & [underline]Agriculture[/underline]. And
it is fortunate for the extension of useful discovery,
that this [underline]connection[/underline] is founded upon very simple
[underline]principles[/underline] which may be [underline]easily acquired[/underline] & which
are almost independent of the more abstruse &
more complicated parts of the Science.
- The objects of the Chemistry of [underline]Agriculture[/underline]
are very simple & distinct & they may be easily
classed & arranged. -
- In the Natural order of enquiry the first
subject that presents itself is the Knowledge
of the Nature & composition of Soils, - of the
methods by which they may be distinguished
& of the conditions essential to fertility -
The discussion of the constitution of plants &
of the natural Agents to which they are subjected
properly follows - And on the comparison of
the constituent principles of vegetable matter;
with the constituent principles of Soils of water
& of Air, the general theory of the growth of
[underline]plants[/underline] is necessarily [underline]founded,[/underline] for all the organic
matter that they contain must be derived either
from the Land in which they grow or from the Atmos=
=phere by which they are surrounded. -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00008|dnp21c006pp|63035478[/page]
- The [underline]effects of Manures[/underline] whether they are
such as supply immediate Nourishment to the
vegetable organs or whether they are such as
merely increase the activity of their functions
merit in the highest degree, a full examination;
& from the Knowledge of those effects in their
relations to different soils the general chemical
Theory of the improvement of Land, the last
& most important part of the investigation is
naturally derived. -
- I shall endeavour in this Course of Lectures
to pursue these objects in the order in which
they have been enumerated, & to bring
forward all the new & useful information
that I have been able to collect with regard
to them - I shall particularly attend to
the experimental part of the subject & to
those operations which offer immediate practical
applications; - & I shall take the liberty
of prefacing the investigation by [unclear]devoting[/unclear]
the remainder of this lecture to a sketch of the
History & progress of the Science; which will

[page]9|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00009|dnp21c007pp|63035480[/page]

enable me to point out my authorities; to pass over
the course of reading connected with the subject,
& to reason from what has been discovered, con=
=cerning what still remains to be [deletion]discovered. -[/deletion][insertion]effected. -[/insertion]
- To begin on this subject, "The History
of the [underline]Chemistry[/underline] of [underline]Agriculture[/underline] embraces but a
short period of time - Chemistry as a Science
was wholly unknown to the great Nations of Anti=
=quity, & their Agriculture consequently was
unconnected with any speculative chemical
principles" - It was an Art brought by continued
labour to a certain degree of perfection; but the
knowledge was purely empirical & independent
of any general system of philosophy. -
- The most important part perhaps of
the [underline]chemistry[/underline] of Vegetation "that relating to
the food of plants" was very early a subject
of attention; but accurate knowledge upon
it has only been obtained within the last
thirty years -
The [underline]Greek philosophers[/underline] had formed

[page]10|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00010|dnp21c008pp|63035482[/page]
opinions on the matter, but they were the
vague generalizations of [underline]talents[/underline], unassisted
by experiment or observation - Water, Air
Earth & Fire were necessarily supposed to
be the principles of all things - but Water
was the favourite Element
"- The expression of
the Poet; was a grand philosophical
Dogma transmitted by the Greeks to the Romans
& adopted even by the earlier Chemists -
- There is a famous exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. on this idea made
by Van Helmont". which He considered as
proving not only that [underline]plants[/underline] were formed
from Water but likewise that Earth might
be composed from it. - Van Helmont
watered a willow for five years with
distilled water - And He found at
the end of that time that it had gained
119 pounds whilst the Earth in which it
grew had only suffered a loss of three ounces. -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was published about the year 1610

[page]11|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00011|dnp21c009pp|63035484[/page]

& was repeated by the celebrated Boyle who
seemed inclined to the conclusion "[underline]That[/underline]
[underline]both Vegetable matter & Earth might be com=[/underline]
=[underline]posed[/underline] in the processes of Nature, from mere
moisture. -
- It was not till 1699 that the fact
was seen in the true point of view, & that
in consequence of the researches of [underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Woodward[/underline]
who published a paper in the 21 V[superscript]o[/superscript] of "Phil:
Trans." in which He shewed that Water in
all its common states contained Earth "& other
foreign ingredients - & He proved "That
the increase of weight of plants nourished by
water was in some measure proportional to
the materials dissolved in the water." That
they grew fastest in impure water & in river
water, less in rain water, & least of all in
distilled water -" & He concluded "That though
moisture was an essential part of the food of
plants yet that it was not their only food"
& He shewed "that [underline]there was no[/underline] reason for
[underline]supposing it convertible into Earth[/underline]" - & that

[page]12|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00012|dnp21c010pp|63035486[/page]
the substances contained in soils are essential to healthy
vegetation. -
- The paper of Woodward affords an excellent
specimen of judicious & satisfactory exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. & of
acute induction, but it seems to have affected in a
very slight degree only the opinions of the Agricul=
=tural & philosophical world. -- & Jethro Tull
in his treatise on the drill Husbandry published
25 years after in 1724 espoused the ancient doctrine
"& asserted that water & the Atmosphere supplied
the whole nourishment of the Vegetable world."
& that Soils were of no other use than as receptacles
for the roots of plants; - & "that manures acted
in no other way than in [underline]modifying[/underline] or [underline]ameliorating[/underline]
the [underline]texture[/underline] of the Soil - in short that their
agency was mechanical - [underline]Tull[/underline] had observed
with minute attention the excellent effects produ=
=ced in Farming by a minute division of the
soil & an exposure of it to the influence of
Air; His imagination was strongly impressed
by these circumstances & by the efficacy of his
own discoveries: & like many other [underline]Men of[/underline]
[underline]genius[/underline] He erred only in carrying his Theory
too far - but though his Hypothesis was

[page]13|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00013|dnp21c011pp|63035489[/page]
11
false as a general expression of doctrine, his prac=
=tices were correct & of the highest importance
- A Translation of Tull's dissertation was
published by Du Hamel who espoused the doctrine
& endeavoured to elucidate it by various exper[superscript]ts[/superscript],,
Tull himself said "that He had raised 13 good
crops of wheat successively by the drill practice
without manure." & Du Hamel quotes M. Chateauvieux
as having had similar success during several years
in which He had used the new Husbandry "this
is in his work brought forward in 1754 but He
has in his lat[deletion]t[/deletion]er publications allowed the necess=
=ity of manures. & of a combination of the old
with the new system. -
The chemical exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. of Du Hamel given in
his "Physique des Arbres" are many of them inge=
=niously contrived, but the conclusions drawn
from them are often forced & not warranted by
the facts - His processes when fairly inter=
=preted prove what Woodward had advanced
& are contradictory to the system they were
meant to support. -
- At the time that Du Hamel was publishing
his last works those great discoveries in Chemistry
were beginning to be made known which

[page]14|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00014|dnp21c012pp|63035491[/page]
have since altogether altered the methods,
the arrangements & the theories of [underline]the Science[/underline]
& have elevated it from a mere unconnected
series of facts to a noble & systematic
branch of Natural Science.-
- The effect, of the late progress of [underline]Chemistry[/underline]
in explaining the phenomena of the nourishment
& growth of plants was great & immediate -
D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestl[deletion]e[/deletion]y & M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Scheele about 1774 discovered
the composition of the atmosphere that it
consisted of two principal aerial fluids one
only of which supported flame" - This truth
at once laid open the theory of the agency of
[underline]air[/underline] upon plants & D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priestly soon ascertained
"[underline]that plants absorbed carbonic acid[/underline]" or fixed
air & in the sunshine gave out pure air or
oxygene. -
- The knowledge of the composition
of water developed by [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish[/underline] in 1785
& of the constitution of fixed air ascertained
by Lavoisier served likewise to elucidate
the most important of the processes of vegetable
life. - [underline]Water[/underline], consists of inflammable air

[page]15|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00015|dnp21c013pp|63035494[/page]
13
or as it is called hydrogene united to pure air
or oxygene. Carbonic acid consists of Charcoal
united likewise to pure air. -
- In vegetation by the living powers & chemical
affinities of plants these substances [underline]are decom=[/underline]
=posed "Their inflammable part combined
with the vegetable & the pure air set free
to supply that waste which is constantly
taking place in consequence of combustion &
the respiration [underline]of Animals[/underline]"
- These discoveries may be found in D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Priest=
=ley's Volumes of Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. & in Lavoisier's "Elements of
Chemistry." - The applications of them to
Agriculture is well explained in D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Ingenhousz's
paper on the food of plants published by the
Board, & in Lord Dundonnald's treatise & "
And a general View of the subject is given
in the fourth Volume of Thomson's "System
of Chemistry" a book that I may safely re=
=commend as the best compilation of Che=
=mistry as yet published as a work composed
with singular accuracy & candour; & equally
fitted as an elementary book, for the student,
& as a Book of [underline]Reference[/underline] for the initiated
Chemist. -

[page]16|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00016|dnp21c014pp|63035496[/page]
- The [deletion]researches[/deletion][insertion]experiments[/insertion] of Hassenfratz published in
the 13 & 14 Volumes of the "Annales de. Chimie"
those of Sennebier; & the [deletion]excellent experiments[/deletion][insertion]admirable researches[/insertion]
on manures made by the Secretary to the
Board " all concur in demonstrating the
same theory - with regard to the nourishment
of [underline]plants[/underline] & the operation of external [underline]agents[/underline]
[underline]upon[/underline] them" -
- Plants are found by analysis to consist
principally of charcoal "& aeriform matter". -
They give out by distillation volatile compounds,
the elements of which are pure air " inflammable
air coaly matter & Azote, or the same elastic
substance as that which forms a great part of
the Atmosphere & which is incapable of supporting
combustion. -
- These elements they gain either by their
leaves from the Air, or by their roots from the
soil - All manures from organized substances
contain the principles of vegetable matter which
during putrefaction are rendered either soluble
in water or aeriform - & in these states they
are capable of being assimilated to the vegetable
organs. - No one [underline]principle[/underline] affords, the

[page]17|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00017|dnp21c015pp|63035497[/page]
15
pabulum of vegetable life - it is neither
charcoal nor hydrogene nor azote, nor
oxygene alone, but all of them together in
various states & various combinations. -
- The Theory of the general operation of
the more compound manures may be rendered
very obvious by simple chemical principles
but there is still much to be discovered [underline]with[/underline]
[underline]regard to the best methods[/underline] of rendering animal
& vegetable substances soluble; with regard
to the processes of decomposition how they may
be accelerated or retarded & the best means
of producing the greatest effects from the
materials employed. -
- The chemistry of the more simple
manures, the manures which act in very
small quantities such as Gypsum, the
alkalies & various saline substances is
far from being so well understood - These
substances are found however in minute
proportions in the greater number of plants
& probably may be essential to their Health
if not to their existence. - They probably
render the absolutely necessary food more nourishing
& act in a manner similar to that in which

[page]18|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00018|dnp21c016pp|63035499[/page]
condiments act in the animal system. -
On this subject I shall be able to offer some
new experimental elucidations which I hope
will not be found unworthy your attention.-
- The ancient notion of the use of [underline]fallowing[/underline]
was that "the ground attracted some principles
from the atmosphere which rendered it fertile
- the chemical doctrine as derived from modern
discoveries - demonstrates that all its efficacy
is derived from the decomposition & fermen=
=tation of the vegetable matters which have
been burned beneath the surface; & which
become soluble & a good manure by the
action of [underline]Air & water[/underline]. -
- With regard to the true causes of the
advantages of paring & burning there is still
much to be discovered - It certainly often
destroys inert vegetable matter which
injured the texture of the soil & converts
it into manure; & it must materially
improve clayey lands & marles, by
furnishing a light & loose earth. -
- The true theory of the advantages of
[underline]irrigation[/underline] was known more than two centuries

[page]19|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00019|dnp21c017pp|63035502[/page]
17
ago - Lord Bacon has delivered it in his
Natural History in the 17 section on Vegetation
"Meadow watering He says acts not only by supplying
useful moisture to the Grass; but likewise the
Water carries nourishment dissolved in it;
& by defending the Roots from the effects of cold."
- Slacked lime was used by the Romans
in manuring the soil in which fruit trees
grew - This we are informed of by Pliny;
[underline]Marle[/underline] had been employed by the Britons
& the Gauls from the earliest times as a
top dressing for Land "- but the precise
period in which [underline]burnt Lime[/underline] first came
into general use in the cultivation of Lands
is I believe unknown - The origin of the
application from the early practises is suf=
=ficiently obvious - a Substance which had
been used with success in gardening, must
have been soon tried in Farming; & in coun=
=tries where marle was not to be found
calcined Limestone would be naturally
tried as a [underline]substitute[/underline]. - .
- The elder writers on Agriculture had no
correct notions either of the nature of Lime

[page]20|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00020|dnp21c018pp|63035504[/page]
or Limestone, or marle or of their effects &
this was the necessary consequence of the imperfection
of the Chemistry of the Age. - Calcareous
Matter was considered by the Alchemists as a
peculiar earth; which in the fire became
combined with an inflammable acid &
Evelyn, & Hartlib & still later Lisle in
their works on Husbandry [underline]have characterised[/underline]
it merely as a [underline]hot[/underline] manure of use in [underline]cold[/underline]
[underline]lands[/underline]. -
- It is to D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black of Edinburgh that the
first & grand rudiments of our knowledge on
this subject are owing - About the year
1750 this illustrious Professor proved by the
most decisive Exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. that Limestone & all
its modifications marbles, chalks & marles,
consist principally of a "peculiar Earth" united
to an aërial acid" - He shewed that their
effervescence in Vinegar is owing to the
loss of this acid - that it is given out in
burning - occasioning a loss of 40 p[superscript]r[/superscript] Cent" -
that the Lime in consequence becomes
caustic & is then as far as our knowledge
extends a single or elementary body." -
- These important facts immediately

[page]21|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00021|dnp21c019pp|63035506[/page]
19
applied with equal efficacy, to the expla=
=nation of the uses of Lime both as a cement
& as a Manure - As a cement Lime,
applied in its caustic state acquires its
hardness & durability by absorbing the
aërial (or as it has been since called)
Carbonic acid which always exists in small
quantities in the Atmosphere - it becomes
as it were again Limestone -
- Chalks, Calcareous Marles or pow=
=dered Limestones act merely by forming a
useful earthy ingredient of the Soil; & their
efficacy is proportioned to the deficiency
of calcareous matter which in larger or
smaller quantities seems to be an essential
ingredient of all fertile soils - necessary
perhaps to their proper texture, & as an
ingredient in the organs of plants. -
- [underline]Burnt lime[/underline] in its first effect acts
as a decomposing agent upon animal or
vegetable matter. - & seems to bring it into
a state in which it becomes more readily a
vegetable nourishment." gradually how=
=ever it becomes neutralised by carbonic acid

[page]22|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00022|dnp21c020pp|63035508[/page]
& converted into a substance analogous to chalk;
but in this case it more perfectly mixes with the
other ingredients of the Soil & is more generally
diffused & finely divided; & when mild is
probably more useful to land than any
calcareous substance in its Natural state.-
-- Soon after the discovery of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Black
an admirable dissertation on Limestones &
on Lime was published by the Bishop of Landaff;
& it is to be found in the second volume of
his Essays -. The analyses are perfect & a
statement of the products of Lime from
given weights of the different stones is given
in the highest degree useful to the Agriculturist
- amidst all the great modern improvements
the value of this paper is undiminished - The
views are practical & they still retain all
their excellence & all their importance. -
- The most considerable fact made
known with regard to Limestone within
the last few years is owing to M[superscript]r[/superscript] Tennant
It had been [insertion]long[/insertion] known that a particular
species of Limestone found in different
parts of the N of England when applied

[page]23|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00023|dnp21c021pp|63035511[/page]
21.
in its burnt & slacked state to Land in
considerable quantities occasioned Sterility
or considerably injured the crops for many
years. - - M[superscript]r[/superscript] Tennant by a chemical
examination of this species of Limestone ascer=
=tained" that it differed from the common
Limestones by containing magnesian Earth &
by several experiments He proved that this
Earth was prejudicial when applied in
large quantities in its caustic state to Vegetation"
These facts are detailed in the "Phil: Trans": for
1800 - in Nicholson's "philosophical Journals"
- This new acquisition upon the subject
is of considerable importance; but there is
still a great field open for useful investi=
=gation with regard to the Nature, compo=
=sition & properties of the various calcareous
substances -
- The Magnesian Limestone so pernicious
in large quantities is used in small quantities
with excellent effects - It is a common manure
both in Derbyshire & in Leicestershire - I have
myself seen it applied to Land in these
Counties & the Farmers say "that it is more
active than the common Limestone & distinguished
it by the name of [underline]Hot Lime[/underline]. -

[page]24|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00024|dnp21c022pp|63035514[/page]
- Amongst some specimens of Limestone
which were put into my hands by Lord Somerville
one called Black Pople Limestone from Somer=
=setshire was pointed out as peculiarly ex=
=cellent in Quality - By Analysis I found it
a magnesian Limestone containing likewise
Iron & manganese. - It loses more than
1/2 its weight by burning & as the Noble Lord
informed me had been used with the best effects
as a manure upon his Estate. - It would be
exceedingly curious and useful to ascertain whether
there is any peculiarity of composition in those
soils in Yorkshire where the Magnesian Limestone
is peculiarly detrimental. -
- I examined the soil of some fields in
Derbyshire where it was said to be successfully
used - They were clays not remarkably
stiff, & not effervescing with acids, so that
they contained very little calcareous matter -
Lime is generally used about Doncaster in very
large quantities & probably too extensive
an application is the cause of the bad effects
of the magnesian Limestone in this district;
for it is said there "that too much of the common
Lime cannot be applied to the Land," &

[page]25|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00025|dnp21c023pp|63035517[/page]
23
that the effects however great the quantity
are always beneficial. -
- The [underline]organization[/underline] of [underline]Vegetables[/underline], & their
physiology was almost wholly unknown, till
the middle of the 17 century. - & the first
person who paid any minute attention to this
subject so intimately connected with Agriculture
was [underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Grew[/underline]. - / [underline]His Lectures[/underline] on the Anatomy
& philosophical History of Plants read before
the Royal Society were published in 1682 &
they contain a great number of discoveries, deli=
=neated in minute & accurate details. -
- The objects to which this Philosopher directed
his attention were great & extensive - He proposed
to himself first to give an accurate view of
the organization of plants & of their chemical
composition 2[superscript]dly[/superscript]. to describe & analyse the
substances necessary to their nourishment & growth
& 3.[superscript]dly[/superscript] to explain on these data the general
phenomena of Vegetation. -
- It was that part only which relates to the
anatomy of plants that he was enabled to bring
forward to the world in any state of perfection. -
Here he needed scarcely any other instrument

[page]26|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00026|dnp21c024pp|63035520[/page]
than the microscope - but for the chemical
enquiries the apparatus of that time was
wholly inadequate; [person]person_020|Grew[/person] was an indefati=
=gable experimentalist but he wanted methods
& his labours on the composition of plants
though carried on with indefatigable zeal
& directed by extraordinary ingenuity are
now of little importance from the imperfection
of the Chemical knowledge of the Age. -
- His book may be still studied with
advantage however on account of the distinct
History it gives of the organs of a number of
plants. - [person]person_020|Grew[/person] was one of the first persons
who suspected the nature of the generation of
seeds & the sexes of plants & his discoveries on
this subject laid the foundation for the beautiful
generalization & arrangement of Linneus -
- Malphigi followed almost the same
tract as [person]person_020|Grew[/person] & nearly at the same time
& independently ascertained a great number
of the same facts, with regard to the anatomy
of plants. -
- Malphigi & [person]person_020|Grew[/person]w endeavoured

[page]27|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00027|dnp21c025pp|63035531[/page]
25
to ascertain the nature of the vessels
through which the sap ascended; & [person]person_020|Grew[/person]
supposed that it passed through all the
parts of the plant the bark the wood
& the pith upwards, an idea now known
to be [underline]erroneous[/underline]. -
- D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Blair in a work published
in 1720 has given some curious details
on the generation & nutrition of plants
- & in that work endeavours to prove
a circulation of the sap analogous to the
circulation of the blood in animals an
opinion likewise maintained by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bradley.
- Six years after the curious statical
Essays of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Hales made their appearance
a work too well known, to need any
minute comment - D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales after having
in a number of instances defined the force
with which the sap rises in vegetables
concluded against the idea of its cir=
=culation & supposes the causes of its ascent

to the attraction of cohesion. -
- Du Hamel published in different
memoirs which appeared between 1740,
& 1765 a number of curious experiments
upon vegetation & upon the functions of
the different parts of plants. & He was
followed by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hume whose "principles
of Agriculture & Vegetation" contains
a very distinct & elegant account of
the "physiology of plants at that [underline]period[/underline]"
- From the time that D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hume
wrote till within these last few years
no very important discoveries were made
on this subject & the last & certainly
the most considerable facts that have
been made known are owing to the
labour & sagacity of an Honorary
member of the [underline]Board[/underline]. -

- A beautiful & philosophical Acc[superscript]t[/superscript].
"of the physiological functions of plants"
may be found in the different papers published
by [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Knight[/person] in the "Phil: Trans": from 1800 to
the present year - His [underline]views[/underline] are [underline]in general[/underline]
[underline]new[/underline] - & in the course of a very short time
He has done more for the complete elucidation
of the subject [underline]than had been effected by[/underline]
[underline]all the more ancient labours[/underline]. - [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript].[/person]
[person]person_024|Knight's[/person] idea is that the sap circulates "-
"That it rises from the roots through the
vessels of the alburnum into the leaves
where it is modified by the action of Heat,
Light, & Air & descends through the Bark
producing by the condensation of some of its
constituents, the new parts which [underline]annually[/underline]
[underline]appear[/underline]" - [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight's[/person] papers are
perfect models for this species of investigation
His experiments are never performed blindly
& from accidental [underline]combinations[/underline] - There is
always a [underline]design & an end[/underline], some accurate

[page]30|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00030|dnp21c028pp|63035539[/page]
[underline]analogy[/underline] seems always to guide the con=
=ception & some happy discovery seems
always to follow the execution. -
- I ought not to pass over the
Authors who have written on the Oe=
=conomy of Vegetation without noticing
the works of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Darwin - They claim
attention - some attention for their merits,
more for their former popularity. - "The
[underline]Zoonomia[/underline] The Laws of organic Life" contains
no observations on Vegetation which are
not likewise to be found in the [underline]Phytologia[/underline].
or the treatise on "the Laws of Vegetation,
Agriculture & Gardening. - Many of the
physiological details in this work are
very curious & interesting & D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Darwin
anticipated [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] in supposing
that the Vessels for containing the ascending
sap are peculiar tubes in the Alburnum.
- The chemical Theories of the Phytologia
do not however merit the same praise.

they are seldom founded upon facts; &
the Author is constantly throwing out
conjectures, without any attention to the
progress of discovery - Conjectures sometimes
[deletion]to[/deletion] so wild as to render it doubtful whether
He is in jest or in earnest - Whether He
is amusing himself or attempting to amuse
the public. - That I may not be accused
of misrepresentation I shall mention one
of the many instances of his neglect of
well known chemical principles - In
his account of Tanning he says "it is owing
to the astringent matters shortening the
fibres of the skin" & yet the chemical
Theory of the Art had long been current
in all the periodical works. -
- It is disagreeable to me to be obliged
to bestow censure upon any part of the
speculations of so ingenious a Man; -
but I feel it as a duty; & what Blumen=
=back said of the Zoonomia may be applied

with much more truth to the Chemistry
of the Phytologia "That there were many
things new in it & many things true in it;
but that what was new was not true &
what was true was not new." -
- Soils had been distinguished prin=
=cipally by their mechanical properties
only, till about the year 1740 when
Pott of Berlin discovered the difference
between Siliceous & aluminous Earth
- some attention was soon after excited
with regard to their chemical composition
- D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Cullen, & after him D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black treated
of this subject in their chemical lectures
before the year 1765 - but Bergman
of Upsal was the first person who attem=
=pted a [underline]regular analysis[/underline]. -
- In his treatise de terris geoponicis
presented to the society of Montpellier in
1773 & afterwards published in the fifth
V[superscript]o[/superscript]. of his Opuscula" - He has described

[page]33|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00033|dnp21c031pp|63035545[/page]
31
with considerable accuracy methods of
detecting the principal constituent parts
of soils - which He justly defines as
Siliceous, Aluminous, calcareous &
Magnesian Earths. oxide of Iron saline
substances & vegetable or animal matter. -
- Bergman examined several of the
best soils in Sweden & He found "that
they all contained different proportions of
the four Earths" & that no given mixture
was uniformly connected either with fertility
or barreness" -
- He examined the ashes of the various
species of grain & He found in different
cases different mixtures of the primitive
Earths; from which He concluded "that
no given portion was absolutely essential
to their health. - a fact of considerable
importance & which has been since con=
=firmed by the researches of T-de Saussure

[page]34|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00034|dnp21c032pp|63035547[/page]
who found "That plants growing upon
a Siliceous soil gave principally on anal=
=ysis' Siliceous Earth & those growing upon
calcareous soils - [underline]calcareous Earth[/underline]"
- Bergman's Essay still retains its
original value; - & though very great
improvements have been made in the
methods of experiment it is still worthy
of an attentive perusal - on account of
its perspicuity of outline, clearness of
detail; & for the views which it pre=
=sents on the subject of the amelioration
of Soils; - it is one of the very few
chemical writings which have been
little impaired by time. -
- The next writer after Bergman
who examined the subject of the com=
=position & Analysis of Soils is M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan
who has given some excellent details
upon the subject in his Essay on Manures
printed in the fifth V[superscript]o[/superscript] of the R I Academy.

[page]35|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00035|dnp21c033pp|63035550[/page]
33
- M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan has pointed out in a
very philosophical manner the relations
of the fertility of soils of different com=
=position to situation & to Climate -
& has simplified considerably the exper=
=iments for detecting their constituent
parts. -
- The Science of Chemistry &
of the analysis of Earthy bodies has
however been greatly extended particu=
=larly by Vauquelin & Klaproth ever
since the year when the Essay on
Manures appeared. -
The [deletion]latest[/deletion] discoveries on the
subject [insertion]as [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] late as 1801[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] I had the honour of laying
before the Board in a paper published
in the last V[superscript]o[/superscript]. of the communications.
- With regard to the Minute
chemical examination of [underline]Soils[/underline], a degree
of perfection has been attained in the
processes which cannot be far extended

[page]36|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00036|dnp21c034pp|63035553[/page]
- but the rude method of examination
the only one that can be employed by
the farmer is still susceptible of
much simplification - We have
an accurate obvious test for calcareous
Earth in its effervescence with acids
- There are likewise [insertion]new[/insertion] tests equally
easy of application of the presence
of the other Earths & these I shall
describe in the next lecture. -
- Soils are derived from the de=
=composition of Rocks & contain the same
earthy constituent parts; - & when
the Art of examining them is a little
more advanced - & the comparison of
their chemical with their external,
or common sensible properties, made
an [underline]object of attention[/underline]. - there is every
reason to believe that the intimate
nature of a soil will be known by
bare inspection to the Scientific

farmer, as distinctly as the species of
a Stone is to the Mineralogist. -
- This kind of knowledge would
give infinitely greater value to the
facts collected - The History of
an excellent Course of Crops or the
happy result of an experiment on tillage
can be of little practical application
unless the nature of the [underline]Soil[/underline], of the
Subsoil, the quantity of rain that fell
be generally denoted. -
- Such information would bear the
stamp of truth & would be capable of
being immediately connected with the
general principles of Science - &
a few histories of experiments in
which all the proper circumstances
were attended to would be of more
value than the [underline]greatest possible[/underline] accu=
=mulation of [underline]imperfect trials[/underline], conducted
merely in the empirical spirit. -

[page]38|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00038|dnp21c036pp|63035557[/page]
- It has been said & undoubtedly
with great truth that a [underline]philosophical[/underline]
[underline]Chemist[/underline] would make a very unprofitable
business of farming; & this undoubtedly
would be the case unless he had served
his apprenticeship as well to the [underline]Art[/underline]
as to the [underline]Science[/underline]. - But he would
make a better farmer than a Man
in other respects equal & ignorant
of Chemistry altogether; His Science
as far as it went would be useful to
him; But the discovery of principles
& the carrying them into execution require
very different talents & very different
[underline]habits[/underline].- The Constructor of the
most accurate chart of latitudes
& longitudes would probably soon
wreck a vessel if employed to steer
it; but the practised Pilot may

[page]39|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00039|dnp21c037pp|63035562[/page]
37
be securely directed by his labours. -
- In proportion as Science advances
all the practical methods become less
complicated & consequently more useful;
- & it is then principally that their
application is made to the useful Arts.
- The common labourer can never be en=
=lightened by the general principles of
philosophy - but He will employ
any simple indication of the utility
of which He is fully convinced. -
- The [underline]great end[/underline] of chemical investiga=
=tion on this subject ought undoubtedly
to be the discovery of [underline]practical methods[/underline]. -
but to this end Scientific principles,
Theory & experiment are alike necessary -
The Mind ought to be constantly preserved
in active speculation - & Industry is
never so efficacious as when assisted
by Science - we may then apply to it
the words of Petronius "Quicquid in

[page]40|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00040|dnp21c038pp|63035567[/page]
orbe vides paret mihi Florida
Tellus cum volo, [underline]fundit opes[/underline]"
- It undoubtedly happens in agri=
=cultural chemical experiments con=
=ducted even after the most refined
theoretical views that there are more
than nine instances of failure for one of
success; & this is inevitable; from the
Capricious & uncertain nature of the
causes that operate, & from the impossi=
=bility of calculating on all the circumstan=
=ces that may interfere; - But this is
far from proving the [underline]inutility[/underline] of such
trials - one happy result which can
generally improve the methods of cultivation
which can increase the general means
of subsistence is worth the labour of
a whole life; & an unsuccessful
experiment well observed must establish
some truth or tend to remove some

prejudice. -
- Agricultural Chemistry is not
in that state in which Natural Philoso=
=phy seems to have been at the time of
the foundation of the Royal Society when
the Council recommended to their curator
the celebrated Rob[superscript]t[/superscript]. Hooke to make
at least one capital discovery every
week. -
- It is only by much labour & by
multiplied trials conducted by many minds
& executed by many hands & carried on
through a long succession of years that
any thing complete can be hoped for
in this Branch of Knowledge. -
- It has existed only for a [underline]few years[/underline];
& it aught not [underline]to be expected[/underline] to be
[underline]perfect & efficacious[/underline] in its earliest
[underline]infancy[/underline]; to be a giant at the moment
of its birth. -

applied & liberal patronage be=

hardly fail of being useful &
magnificent. -

Lecture 2.
[Short horizontal rule]
[underline]Organs & Composition of Plants.[/underline]
- Vegetables are possessed of a principal
of life & they are acted upon by [underline]laws[/underline] different
from those which govern common matter. Their
functions however are modified by external agents;
& their living powers being exerted in a much
more feeble manner than those of Animals
are more immediately influenced by common
natural changes. -
- All Vegetables are produced from seed
Their germination to growth depend upon the
assimilation of new matter to their living parts.
- They derive their nourishment from
the soil in which they grow & the Atmosphere
by which they are surrounded. And that
we may be able to judge of the manner in
which this nourishment is subservient to
their life it is necessary that we should first
study the nature of the organs by which it
is received & modified & the [underline]principles[/underline] of
which they are composed. -
- The forms of vegetables are almost
infinitely diversified - yet the [underline]structure[/underline] of
such of them as have been accurately examined
is found in many respects analagous & in

[page]44|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00044|dnp21c042pp|63035576[/page]
consequence of this circumstance the same
general reasonings may be applied in accounting
for the functions of the same species of organs
in different plants . -
- In every [underline]perfect vegetable[/underline] there are
found at least four distinct classes of organs
which though very different as to their size
& appearances are in some respects similar
in construction. The roots the trunk &
branches the leaves & the flower or seeds -
- The roots the trunk & branches are
chiefly alike as to original structure & they
are composed of analogous parts. -
- When the trunk of a tree is cut trans=
=versely there is perceived at least three dif=
=ferent bodies the bark the wood & the pith
& these bodies are again capable of a new
division -
- The bark when perfectly formed is covered
by a thin [underline]membrane[/underline] which as in the instance
of the [underline]Elder[/underline] may be easily separated & which
is called the [underline]epidermis[/underline] it is composed of a
number of small laminae or scales & in old
trees is found broken into parts at its surface. -

[page]45|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00045|dnp21c043pp|63035579[/page]
43
Instance.
- Beneath the epidermis is situated the
[underline]paryn-chyma[/underline] which is a soft substance of a
cellular structure its colour is green & it is
always more or less filled with moisture. -
- The cortical layers form the innermost part
of the [underline]bark[/underline] & their numbers vary with the
age & size of the tree. They are composed
of [underline]longitudinal fibres[/underline] which in some cases are
exceedingly strong & firm & they contain pores
or vessels which may be distinctly seen in
many instances in the horizontal section. -
- The [underline]external[/underline] part of the wood in trees
is called the sapwood or [underline]alburnum[/underline] it is
the living part & in annual shoots reaches
even to the pith it contains a number of
pores or vessels in some of which the sap appears
immediately to ascend from the roots & in
others of which it is transmitted to the leaves. -
- The woody matter in the alburnum
 consists of the silver grain & of the bastard
grain. [underline]Instance[/underline] Oak
The first appears in their lamina extending
from the pith towards the bark - The second

[page]46|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00046|dnp21c044pp|63035581[/page]
constitutes the concentric [underline]layers[/underline] which denote
by their number the age of the tree -
Instance
The pith or medulla in young trees & in
annual shoots is soft & full of juice but
in old trees it is dry & spongy - It is
composed of a number of cells & in its
living state its use is probably to supply
moisture to the vessels of the [underline]alburnum[/underline]
by the spinal tubes - [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] has
shewn however that the presence of it is
not essential to the growth of plants, for it
was found in cases when it was removed
that vegetation was not materially impeded.
- In the [underline]roots[/underline] of [underline]trees[/underline] as may be
easily discovered by inspection there is the
same arrangement of parts as in the trunk
& branches. -
- The pores or vessels in the al=
=burnum extend to the minutest filaments
& in these filaments they appear to exert
their action in the moisture & nourishing

[page]47|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00047|dnp21c045pp|63035584[/page]
45
fluids contained in the soil. - The
alburnum in shrubs & in annual plants
bears only a very small proportion to the
bark & pith & there is little accumulation
of woody matter except in the fibres of the
[underline]roots[/underline]. -
- The leaves of plants are attached
to their branches by foot stalks their basis
is a number of fibres which intersect each other
in various directions & which contain the
tubes through which the sap rises to their
extremities. -
- They are covered by an epidermis
& beneath this is situated the membranes
or parynchemtous part in the pores or cells
of which the nourishment that they receive
from the sap is probably modified & rendered
fit for assimilation. -
- The flowers of plants are the vege=
=table organs that have been most accu=
=rately studied & most minutely described
& it is upon the different constitutions &
arrangements of their parts that [underline]Linneaus[/underline]

[page]48|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00048|dnp21c046pp|63035586[/page]
has founded that admirable system of class=
=ification which has given to botany the
form of a perfect science. -
- The greater number of [underline]flowers[/underline] are
fixed in a cup or [underline]Calyx[/underline] which is attached
to the flower stalk & which has been
supposed though erroneously to be a con=
=tinuation of the outer bark. -
- The [underline]Corolla[/underline] or [underline]petals[/underline] form in
most cases the base of the flower & in
the corolla are inserted the parts of
reproduction the organs essential to
the formation of seeds. -
- Most plants contain the stamina
& the pistil in one corolla. - but in
others they are arranged in separate cups
- and in a few cases they exist in distinct
plants. -
- The [underline]pistil[/underline] is the basis of the [underline]seed[/underline]
in all plants but that it may be con=
=verted into the seed it is necessary

[page]49|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00049|dnp21c047pp|63035588[/page]
47
that it be acted upon by the pollen or
dust upon the of the stamina.
In consequence of this obscure & singular agency
its form gradually changes & it is at last
converted into the seed vessel. -
- In cases when the pistil & stamina
are seated in one corolla the pollen is
immediately deposited upon the [underline]pistil[/underline] by
contact, but in the instances in which they
are separated from each other no im=
=pregnation takes place unless the fecun=
=datory dust has been carried upon the
seminal parts by winds or by other causes
& it often happens as for instance in the
case of the [underline]female date[/underline] trees that [underline]blossoms[/underline]
are [underline]produced[/underline] but no fruits till male-
trees are brought in their vicinity. -
- The seeds of plants are infolded
in different membranes & when the corolla
& stamina have disappeared after per=
=forming their necessary functions they
are discovered in the place of the [underline]base[/underline]
of the [underline]pistil[/underline]. -

[page]50|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00050|dnp21c048pp|63035591[/page]
When their outward coatings are removed
they are usually found containing two principal
parts of the radicle & the [unclear]peumula[/unclear] which
are the foundation for the root & stem of
the infant plant these parts are small
& visible only in a small number of seeds;
they are discovered by minute inspection in
the large garden bean even in its dry
state & in their [underline]development[/underline] in corn
that has undergone malting. -
Instance
The largest part of the seed is constituted
by the [underline]Colyledons[/underline] which are the sit=
=uated on each side of the radicle &
which are destined for the nourishment
of the infant plant. - The Colyledons
are two in number in the bean - Instance
& wheat only one. -
- It will at present be unnecessary
to enter more minutely into the study of
the structure of vegetables & their various
forms & diversified organs. -

[page]51|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00051|dnp21c049pp|63035595[/page]
49
- This branch of the science even
where it has been most successfully pursued
is still far removed from perfection & the
simplest part of it is that which is most
immediately connected with the facts
at present known relating to the living
functions of plants. -
- The [underline]most general[/underline] the [underline]least perfect[/underline]
of the parts of vegetables these which
approach nearest in their nature to
inorganic matter are yet eminently
different from any of the [underline]substances[/underline]
which are subservient to their formation.
- [underline]These substances[/underline] consequently
must have undergone a new arrangement
in the vegetable organs an arrangement
which can only be estimated by the che=
=mical laws -
- In subjecting the parts of plants
to the agents of Chemistry to the process
called analysis; they are resolved into
new elements & the result of our

[page]52|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00052|dnp21c050pp|63035598[/page]
experiments though imperfect as to some of
their relations yet affording us the means
of estimating the alternate known principles
of which vegetable substances are composed
& enable us to form a probable judgment
in which these principles are procured.
- When any of the vegetable organs
are [insertion]long[/insertion] acted upon by boiling water some of
their parts are dissolved; & after water
is no longer capable of changing them,
new principles are taken up by Spirits
of Wine or Alcohol & made to enter
into Chemical union with it - |_After
these fluids have exerted all their powers
the [underline]substance remaining[/underline] in the greater
number of cases is found possessed of
very similar chemical properties & it
is called [underline]woody fibre[/underline] & it forms
the basis of most of the solid parts of
Trees & plants. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The substances soluble in water are

[page]53|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00053|dnp21c051pp|63035602[/page]
51
usually Gum of which mucilage & farina
are modifications Sugar Colouring principles
of different kinds various astringent matters
which contain the principles essential to the
Tanning of Skin, & [underline]vegetable[/underline] Acids &
other saline [underline]bodies[/underline]. -
- The principles acted on by Spirits of wine
are resinous & oily matters which are
much more seldom found than the bodies
soluble in water. -
- The analysis afforded by the solu=
=tion in fluids offers us however only
the secondary elements of vegetable matter
& the arrangements of these elements may
in many cases be traced with conside=
=rable accuracy in the [underline]vegetable[/underline] organs. -
- Thus we find woody fibre
forming almost wholly the interior
wood or fibres of the plant where its
trigidity & hardness render it necessary
to the support of the organs. -

[page]54|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00054|dnp21c052pp|63035604[/page]
- In the [underline]alburnum[/underline] of farinaceous
plants & different edible plants mucilage
& Sugar are often found & these substances
exist abundantly in fruits. -
- And in the apple the pear &
the plumb & other similar productions
they are united to vegetable acids. -
The [underline]Cotyledons[/underline] of seeds are for
the most part composed of farina or
coagulated mucilage. -
- In the bean for instance this
substance exists in abundance & is dissolved
after long ebullition - In barley it is
found almost pure - in wheat it is found
united to a peculiar insoluble substance
called gluten & in [space left for word] & other similar
seeds it is combined with oil. -
- The leaves of the greater number of
large trees contain as well as mucilage
different astringent principles; & these
principles are usually most [underline]abundant[/underline] in the

- The [underline]epidermis[/underline] both in the bark &
the leaves is uniformly capable of resisting
the action of water - in many cases the upper
surface of leaves is covered with a substance
analagous to [underline]wax[/underline]. -
Instance.
The varnish prevents the evaporation of
moisture by the action of the solar light &
the under surface being free from it is capable
of absorbing water from the air & of drinking
in the dew -
- The [underline]epidermis[/underline] of the trunk in large
trees often contains resinous matter but
its base is analagous in its properties to wood. -
- The epidermis of smaller vegetables is in
many instances composed in a great measure of

[page]56|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00056|dnp21c054pp|63035609[/page]
Earthy matter & in some of the seeds & Grasses
almost the whole of the exterior part of this
Membrane is siliceous earth. -
- In the Calamus Rotang or common
[underline]Rattan[/underline] the glossy substance that invelopes
the bark is flint almost pure & by striking
two plants of this kind together in the dark
sparks of light are perceived. -
- Silex likewise abounds in the
epidermis of rushes & even of grasses & the
peculiar roughness of the surfaces of their
 stalks is owing to this substance. -
- If a stalk of corn be carefully
burnt in a crucible the Earthy matter will
be seen retaining the form of the epidermis
& [space left for word to be inserted] in its appearance. - And
in all those vegetables which are hollow
internally the siliceous earth not only
acts by defending their tender barks from
external injury but serves to support &
to strengthen & may be considered as in
some measure analogous in its purposes to
the earthy matter in the shells of different
animals. -

- The barks of trees & of plants principally
consist of woody fibre being in many vege=

- In large trees the [underline]barks[/underline] are the parts
that contain astringent matter - The
oak is the tree which in our climate affords
the largest quantity of astringent principles
5 pounds of Oak bark being sufficient to
form a pound of [underline]Leather[/underline] 7 pounds of the
bark of the Spanish chesnut are equal
to 5 pounds of Oak bark & the barks of
the Elm & the Elder are about half
so valuable. -
- Many of the trees in our Colonies
are more rich in the Tanning or astringent
principles than the oak bark. -
- The fluids contained in the cells

as yet very little examined as to their

- The Birch as is well known affords
a sap containing sugar & capable of fer=

- The fluid obtained from the young

greater portion of solid matter dissolved
in the sap of most of the grasses. -

- Oils & milky emulsions are amongst
the most common & all these substances
appear to be formed by the nourishing
juices of the plant after it has been mo=
=dified in the leaves by the action of light
& air & partly converted into [underline]solid matter[/underline]
- The powers of Chemistry are far
from being limited by the separation of the
parts of plants into the substances that
have been just described -
- The analysis by means of fluids offers
to us no ultimate products & it is only by
employing the agency of [underline]heat[/underline] that we
are capable of gaining any knowledge of
the real undecomposable [underline]principles[/underline] of [underline]vege=[/underline]

- When any part of a plant exposed
in close vessels in which the products of the
experiment can be examined to the action of
fire water is the first substance that rises

from it permanently elastic fluids are
then generated a little oil & acid come
over & the substance remaining is charcoal
mixed with a small quantity of Alkali &
earthy matter. -
[underline]Instance[/underline] Gum
By passing this fluid matter through a
tube heated red it would be considerably
altered & would be converted into elastic
or aeriform fluid water & charcoal so
that the vegetable matter would be
wholly resolved by the powers of Heat
into gas or air, water, charcoal &
saline matter. -
- Mucilage sugar & woody fibre

resins oils & astringent principles evolve
most aeriform fluids, & oxide or rust of
Iron is found in most cases in the residuum
of the vegetable matter. -
- The [underline]Charcoal[/underline] Earths & Alkalies
produced by the decomposition of vegetable
matter are incapable of being reduced
into a simpler form by any known means
& in their pure states they are supposed
to be perfectly elementary principles. -
- The water & [underline]aeriform bodies[/underline] are
less permanent in their nature & by the
later discoveries they are shewn to be
compound. -
- When [underline]electrical sparks[/underline] are
passed into water gas is slowly evolved
from it & a part of this gas when it is
examined is found analogous to that
aeriform fluid in our atmosphere which
supports combustion & which is called oxygene.
whilst the other part is inflammable & is
denominated Hydrogene the producer of

[page]62|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00062|dnp21c060pp|63035621[/page]
water - so that the body supposed by the
ancients to be the most perfectly elementary
consists of pure & inflammable airs united
by their attraction in a condensed form & in
proportion to each other as about 1 to 6.
When the gas evolved by the action of
Heat upon vegetable matter is agitated
with [underline]lime water[/underline]; an absorption takes place
& a part of the lime is precipitated in union
with [underline]elastic fluid[/underline]. - This absorbable
part is fixed air & is the same substance
with that which is disengaged from Limestone
by vinegar & which is found in brewers vats
It is likewise formed by the burning of [underline]Char[/underline]=
=[underline]coal[/underline] & it is considered as a compound of
pure charcoal or [underline]carbon[/underline] & oxygene or the
vital air focused in the Atmosphere & its
properties being slightly sour it is called
Carbonic Acid. -
- The gas not absorbable by [underline]lime water[/underline]
is found for the most part to be combustible
& it usually burns with a lambent flame. -
- When chemically examined it is

[page]63|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00063|dnp21c061pp|63035623[/page]
61
discovered to be precisely similar in its
properties to the substance obtained by
passing pure inflammable air or hydrogene
over charcoal heated red. - It is beleived
to be a combination of Hydrogene & Carbon
& it is usually called [underline]Hydrocarbonate[/underline] -
 - The elements of plants then gained by
destructive distillation as is evident from
these observations are extremely few & their
nature is [underline]easily understood[/underline]. -
- [underline]Results[/underline] proving the same general facts
are gained from the Combustion of vegetable
matter in the open Atmosphere & by defla=
=gration of them with Nitre or with the
salt called oxymuriate of Potash which
contains an immense quantity of oxygene or
pure [underline]air[/underline] -
[underline]Instance glass bell[/underline]
- In this case water carbonic acid &
a little incombustible gas only are evolved
& a dense charcoal remains in the vessel. -
- The experiments might be diversified in a
variety of manners but the products would
be analogous in their nature though different

[page]64|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00064|dnp21c062pp|63035625[/page]
in quantity in different instances. -
- By no methods of investigation can
absolute certainty be obtained in physical
[underline]science[/underline] but all the phenomena seem to
concur in shewing that the various parts
& organs of plants are constituted by different
arrangements & chemical combinations of a
few simple principles which are for the
most part oxygene or the base of pure
air hydrogene or inflammable air &
carbon or pure charcoal & different
earthy & alkaline [underline]substances[/underline]. -
- This conclusion at first view appears
extraordinary but it is countenanced by
the great science of chemical facts. -
- Even in our common processes we are
capable of producing a very great diversity
of compounds by the different union of
two or three bodies. -
- In these cases solids become fluids
& fluids are partly converted into gasses &
a variety of changes are almost [underline]instantaneously[/underline]
produced. -

- The powers by which these extraordinary
effects are produced in our hands are ex=
=tremely limited & the combining attractions
so quickly called into action are quickly
destroyed. - But in natural operations
the agents are presented to each other under
a variety of circumstances that can never
be obtained in our artificial experiments -
Chemical affinities are modified by the
powers of life & the alterations of form &
structure take place slowly & after a
beautiful & varied order. -
- The [underline]Knowledge[/underline] of the ultimate
composition of vegetable substances will
enable us to understand the agencies of the
Atmosphere & of soils upon plants which
are the subject of the [underline]next lecture[/underline] & when
pursued in its different connections - It
will admit of many applications to the
practises of Agriculture & will afford
some interesting proofs of those laws of or=
=ganised life by which an almost infinite
diversity of appearances is produced by a
few simple causes -

Lecture 3.
[underline]Atmosphere & Soil.[/underline]
- That the process of vegetation the
agency of manures & the effects of cultivation
may be understood it is necessary that an
acquaintance be gained with the natural
agents to which plants are exposed during
their growth. -
- The knowledge of the composition of
the Atmosphere & of soils is one of the most
important parts of the subject of the Chemistry
of Agriculture & one that offers the greater
number of theoretical instructions & practical
application. -
- The presence of the Air is essential to
the health & life of plants & to the operation
of manures - the fertility of the Land is
immediately connected with the influence
of the surrounding Atmosphere and the His=
=tory of its constitution & agencies is well
worthy of a particular examination
- The appearances of the elastic fluid
that every where envelopes us are so simple
& uniform that in the first examination

[page]68|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00068|dnp21c066pp|63035633[/page]
we might suppose it to be an elementary body
& this opinion was prevalent in all former
times - Air was supposed to be undecom=
=posable the most active & pure of natural
agents - by the lately discovered method
of chemical Analysis we are however taught
that it is compound in its essence & that it
contains many substances essentially different
from each other. -
- When quicklime is exposed to the open
Air a matter speedily forms upon its [underline]surface[/underline]
& a part of it is by degrees precipitated to the
bottom of the vessel when the fluid is ex=
=amined after some days it is found no longer
possessed of the acrid taste communicated
by the [underline]Lime[/underline] - The whole of the Earth will
have been deposited in a solid form &
its weight will have been considerably increased.
- It is evident from this fact that the
[underline]Lime[/underline] in the water has combined with some=
=thing existing in the Atmosphere & this is
fixed Air or Carbonic acid. -
Instance
- The existence of fixed Air or Carbonic acid

in the Atmosphere is likewise shewn by its
action upon soap lees - Its proportion to
the other parts of the Atmosphere is very
small & it never exceeds the 1/800 part of
the whole [underline]mass[/underline]. -
- Th gasses which compose the great
portion of the Air are very different in
their [underline]nature[/underline] One of them has been
already mentioned under the name of ox=
=ygene & it is the substance that supports
[underline]combustion[/underline] & the other which is inca=
=pable of supporting [underline]combustion[/underline] is
called [underline]non-respirable[/underline] Air or [underline]Nitrogene[/underline]-
[underline]gas[/underline]. -
- When an inflamed taper or any
other burning body is introduced into
a close vessel filled with [underline]Atmospherical[/underline]
[underline]Air[/underline] whether freed or not from Carbonic Acid
its light gradually diminishes the flame
becomes smaller & at last disappears al=
=together - And after this effect has been
produced the qualities of the Air will be
found wholly altered. - It is no longer

[page]70|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00070|dnp21c068pp|63035638[/page]
capable of supporting combustion & a
small animal if introduced into it
would almost immediately expire. -
Instance [underline]Sulphur[/underline].
- In conducting this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. with perfect
accuracy we find that water is deposited
upon the sides of the vessel & that the
Air is diminished both in volume
& weight. -
- Hence it is evident that something
has been abstracted from it & this is
the principle essential to [underline]combustion[/underline]
the [underline]pure[/underline] air or [underline]oxygene[/underline] & as there
has been no transmission of ponderable
matter through the glass it must
have united itself to the inflammable
body to form new [underline]products[/underline]; -
- The Elastic fluid remaining
which is incapable of supporting the
life of [underline]Animals[/underline] or the flame of burning
bodies is the [underline]Nitrogene[/underline] And it is
called so because it is one of the
Elements of [underline]Nitrous Acid or Aqua fortis[/underline].

[page]71|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00071|dnp21c069pp|63035640[/page]
69
- It is evident from the combustion of
sulphur that the Nitrogene in the Atmos=
=phere considerably exceeds the oxygene in
quantity but this process is not the most
accurate for the Analysis as a little new
aëriform substance is produced in it which
requires some time before it is dissolved by water.
And that we may know precisely the composition
of Air it is necessary that we burn in it some
inflammable body which will absorb the whole
of the [underline]oxygene[/underline] & form with it only solid matter
such a body is [underline]phosphorus[/underline]. -
- When phosphorus is burnt in air in a
manner similar to sulphur it is found that the
absorption is 1/5 which corresponds to the [underline]Nitrogene[/underline].
100 parts in volume of Air contain about one
part of Carbonic Acid 20 or 21 parts of oxygene
gas & 78 or 79 parts of [underline]Nitrogene[/underline] & contain
diffused through their pores a certain quantity
of water. - The fact of the existence of water
in [underline]Air[/underline] in the form of invisible vapour or of
dissolved moisture is shewn by many very simple
experiments. -
- When pearlash or any very soluble salt is
exposed to the atmosphere it soon increases in

[page]72|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00072|dnp21c070pp|63035643[/page]
weight & becomes moist even in the driest
weather & this is owing to its abstracting the
invisible moisture existing in the [underline]Air[/underline]. -
- Likewise when we expose water in small
quantities upon a large surface it speedily
disappears particularly in warm weather
& this depends upon its being diffused through
the Elastic fluid in contact with it. -
- All the phenomena of evaporation
depend upon the power which water possesses
of being rendered elastic in the Air & dew
Rain & snow are occasioned by its deposition
which is generally owing to a diminution of
the Heat in the upper strata of the Atmosphere
as moisture is much more diffusible through
warm than through cold air. -
- In [underline]the Hottest[/underline] weather of [underline]Summer &[/underline]
[underline]when[/underline] the Atmosphere is [underline]fully saturated[/underline] with
moisture in our climate, according to the
experiments of de Saussure it never it never contains
more than 1/20 of its weight of water & in the
coldest & driest weather never less than 1/60. -
- Besides the permanently elastic parts of
Air which are found throughout the whole
of its extent - the Atmosphere often contains
solid & fluid matter which are raised

[page]73|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00073|dnp21c071pp|63035646[/page]
71
from the surface of the Earth & which remains
for a short time mechanically suspended in it
& which are carried down by rain & dews. -
- From Cities & Towns a considerable quantity
of Coaly matter in smoke of saline matter & of
Animal effluvia are continually carried by
the winds & they are sometimes immediately
deposited in the vicinity & are sometimes
transported to the distance of many miles. -
And this circumstance it is necessary to attend to
in considering the influence of the Atmosphere on
vegetables in different situations. -
- Certain vegetables are capable of growing
when their roots are immersed in pure water
& their leaves exposed to the free [underline]Atmosphere[/underline].
- But in this case according to the Exp.[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Hassenfratz they are never found in a healthy
state they are incapable of producing Healthy
seeds. -
- In the natural process of [underline]vegetation[/underline] all
plants are fixed by the different fibres of their
roots in the soil which covers a very considerable
proportion of the [underline]Globe[/underline]. -
- The Atmosphere is every where uniform

[page]74|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00074|dnp21c072pp|63035648[/page]
in its composition; but the soil is almost
infinitely diversified with regard to its con=
=stituent [underline]parts[/underline]. -
- That we may be enabled to understand
fully the chemical History of soils & of their
changes it is necessary that our examination
should commence with their composition -
their origin & their primitive states; & it is
likewise necessary that [underline]we should[/underline] trace
[underline]the causes of their[/underline] natural [underline]modifications[/underline].
- |_ In all countries by penetrating to a
certain distance below the surface - Hard
stony strata or Rocks are discovered -
Generally they occur a very few feet beneath
the soil & are rarely so deep as 100 fathom, -
- All known rocks when exposed to
the atmosphere to moisture & to the
changes of Heat & cold gradually
decompose & sooner or later according as
their nature differs, become a finely divided
earthy matter. -

All Natural Soils when accurately examined exhibit
distinct indications of having been produced by the decom=

On Mountains & in plains the Natural Soil is
usually of the same Chemical Nature as the stratum
on which it rests; but in vallies, where torrents
have acted, or where the sea has retired from the Land.
there is usually a mixture of materials & the surface
contains ingredients derived from various sources; -
& in some cases whole strata when not of great
thickness have been converted into finely divided

- The number of the species of Rocks which
existing in great masses from the known interior
strata of the globe is not very considerable &

- The [underline]soils[/underline] into which their upper surfaces
have decomposed are easily distinguished from

they are found all composed of a few chemical
elements in most cases the same in Nature
& differing only in their proportions & arrangements -

same elements differently arranged. -
- The principal elements of the constituent
parts of Rocks & consequently of [underline]Soils[/underline] are
five in [underline]number[/underline]. Four of them are Earths

- Iron is the form of combination with Air
or as rust. -
- The pure elements of decomposed stones or
of soils may be easily obtained & exhibited
A Hundred grains or any other quantity for this
purpose should be heated to redness with
three times its weight of vegetable or mineral
alkali - four ounces of spirit of Salt or
muriate of salt with an equal quantity of water
should be poured upon it & kept in contact with
it till the [underline]whole is dissolved[/underline]. This will
give us in one fluid compound all the elements;
which may be easily separated from each other.
- By evaporating the fluid to dryness &washing the
solid matter with half pint of water all the
substances remain in solution except the silex
or Earth of flints - This is obtained pure & may
be separated. -

- By the addition of a liquor called Sol:

- So far we have considered soils only
in their most [underline]simple state[/underline] consisting in
all their varieties of diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. combinations
& mixtures of a few primitive materials. -
|_ At a certain depth they in most cases
exhibit this state; but on the surface,
wherever they have been the bed of vege=
=tations they contain besides their Earthy
constituent parts smaller or larger
quantities of organizable particles derived
from the death & destruction of parts of plants
- This happens even without cultivation -

[page]85|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00085|dnp21c083pp|63035672[/page]
83
Even upon the most barren Rocks & on all spots
except desarts of sand - As soon as a small
quantity of finely divided earth has been
formed on the surface. the seeds of mosses &
lichens which are constantly floating in the At=
=mosphere rest upon it: - Their decay &
decomposition affords food for a more perfect
species of plants; & at length from the deposition
of Vegetable matter a soil is formed in which
even trees can fix their roots & which is
capable of rewarding the labour of the cultivator.
- " In the common order of Nature where
Man has not interfered with the Vegetable
Kingdom, almost all the sheltered primitive
soils in habitable Latitudes are cloathed with
immense forests " & the accumulation & consumption
of Vegetable matter continues in equilibrium;
& [underline]peat bogs[/underline] never occur in countries where the
woods have remained undisturbed; |_ but where
a few trees or parts of a forest, have been destroyed
by the early cultivation of the district the rest
accustomed to shelter, soon suffer from their
new exposure, & gradually decay; there is an
accumulation of their organizable matter. - the
soil soon becomes too much saturated with
it & imbibes moisture & is rendered unfit for
supporting the larger species of plants; - |_ & in

[page]86|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00086|dnp21c084pp|63035674[/page]
a few centuries a bog or a morass appears
where a flourishing wood or forest had
before existed. -
- That this is a History & not a visionary
detail is evident from all the facts in our
possession - All the great Bogs in Britain
& in Ireland are evidently the remains of
forests: & parts of decayed trees are always
found in them & there are no Bogs in any of
those countries, where the forests have remained
untouched & in their natural state
- The idea that peat is in a constant state of
increase does not militate against this opinion
- The [underline]peat soil[/underline] though unfit in its natural
state for trees or edible grasses, yet supports a
variety of shrubs of mosses & even of Heaths -
& from this successive decay & reproduction of these
plants new matter is almost constantly adding
to it; - so that it is not extraordinary that
peat of many feet in thickness should be pro=
=duced or renovated in a bog in the course of
a few years. -
- From what I have said of [underline]peat[/underline] a conclusion
follows not altogether unprofitable -

[page]87|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00087|dnp21c085pp|63035676[/page]
85
- The [underline]theory[/underline] shews that it must in all cases be
exceedingly dangerous to cut or destroy the trees in
the outskirts of woods unless they are very highly
sheltered by Hills or mountains - It likewise
teaches - that in thinning woods or plantations
the circumference should be as little touched as
possible; but the timber cut in the largest
quantities in the interior & towards the centre.
- Wherever Vegetable Matter of any kind
decays by the influence of Water & Air something
analogous to peat Earth will undoubtedly be
produced - & where Lakes or ponds are filled
up by the successive generation & destruction
of aquatic plants; a spurious kind of peat is
generated which however is lighter & more
easy of decomposition & is constantly evolving
gaseous matter. -
- The astringent matter of forest trees as
well as their firmness of texture renders them
much more durable & more slow of decomposi=
=tion than succulent plants; - The neighbourhood
of a true [underline]Bog[/underline] is never unhealthy whilst that
of the spurious Bog or Marsh is usually aguish
probably from the great quantity of unhealthy
gaseous matter evolved from the rapid

[page]88|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00088|dnp21c086pp|63035678[/page]
decomposition of the plants -
- The Earthy Matter of peats is uniformly
analogous to that of the stratum on which
they repose - the plants which have formed
them must have derived the Earths that they
contained from this stratum; Thus in Wiltshire
& Berkshire; where the stratum below the peat
is chalk Calcareous Earth abounds in the ashes
& very little alumine & silex - They likewise
contain much oxide of Iron & gypsum both of
which may be derived from the pyrites so abundant
in chalk -
- Different specimens of Peat that I
have burnt from the granitic & shiston Soils
of diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. parts of these islands have always
given ashes principally siliceous & aluminous -
- And a specimen of peat from the County of
Antrim gave ashes which afforded very nearly
the same constituents as the great Basaltic
stratum of the [underline]Country[/underline]. -
- A due proportion between the earthy
& the organisable parts of the soil is essential
to fertility; - but as the earthy ingredients differ
in their Nature so likewise the vegetable matter
differ; - Dry & hard fibres of plants may

[page]89|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00089|dnp21c087pp|63035680[/page]
87
injure a soil even if in the smallest quantities
& render it necessary to pare & burn - whilst
a fine light black vegetable mould mixed in
certain quantities; must uniformly improve
the texture & increase its nutritive powers. -
- The Nature of the Earths in the soil &
their absorbent powers; & their proportions
must materially affect the agency of the vegetable
matter -
- Thus a dry fine sand would bear much
more vegetable earth than a stiff clay or
a marle, which by an excess of it would be
rendered too humid - & I have seen peat Earth
in considerable quantities applied with excellent
success to dry sandy burnt up Lands. -
- The exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was made by a Gentleman an active
member of the Board; upon a soil the chemical
composition of which I examined & which contained
more than 5/6 of fine siliceous sand & the effects
were very great. -
- The vegetable matter in soils not only
supplies food to the plant; but likewise
tends by its powers of absorbing water from the
atmosphere & retaining it to preserve its roots
in a proper state of moisture - & for this
effect its agencies are combined with those
of the [underline]earths[/underline] -

[page]90|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00090|dnp21c088pp|63035682[/page]
- The Earths are absorbent in the following order
Alumine, Carbonate of Lime Carbonate of Magnesia
Silex; which comes far behind all the others - I have
found that 100 grains of dry alumine after being
heated red will gain in dry weather by exposure
to air 5 grains in 24 hours - Carb: of Lime
about 3 Grains - Carb: of Magnesia 2 1/2 [underline]Gas[/underline] &
Silex less than 1 grain -
- [underline]Of course[/underline] the reason is plain why siliceous
soils will bear much more vegetable matter -
|_ They require it to be brought to a due retentive
power for moisture. whilst aluminous &
calcareous Soils are fertile with much
smaller quantities. -
- I have made analysis of Lime [underline]Soils[/underline] which
are exceedingly fertile without containing
much vegetable matter; & which are pro=
=ductive without manure & in all cases -
|_ They have not been many indeed but sufficient
to establish the point - the combined sum of the
aluminous & calcareous Earth has always
exceeded, that of the [underline]siliceous[/underline]. -
- Thus a [underline]Soil[/underline] from Nether Stowey in
Somersetshire remarked in M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Billingsley's survey
for producing alternate crops of wheat &

[page]91|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00091|dnp21c089pp|63035684[/page]
89
beans without manure ( as I have mentioned
in a paper on "the Analysis of Soils" ) - I
found to consist of 1/9 of sand 8/9 of marle 5/100
vegetable [insertion]Earth[/insertion] - & I have since made a more
complete analysis of the marle which contains
76/100 Lime & 20/100 Alumine rem[superscript]r[/superscript]. iron & silex. -
- A Celebrated Soil from in East
Lothian gives results the same as to the main
question. it seems to have resulted from the
decomposition of aluminous stones - An analysis
made with all the correctness I could attain
gave me 11p[superscript]r[/superscript]. Cent Lime 25 of sand 45 of clay
53 alumine & an exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. on the whole gave 9 vege=
=table matter. -
- Besides the dependence of the absorbent
powers of Soils upon a due mixture of the
vegetable & earthy constituent parts - there
is another agency between them of a chemical
Nature - |_ All finely divided vegetable
matter in its decomposing state furnishes
constituent parts capable of uniting with
the Earths - Silex has least attraction.
Carbonate of Magnesia is next in order &
Alumine & Carb: of Lime exert very strong
affinities - Manures in consequence
are soonest exhausted in siliceous Soils by the
action of vegetation & by the decomposing

[page]92|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00092|dnp21c090pp|63035686[/page]
agencies of Heat, light & Air; but they remain
a longer time in combination in aluminous &
calcareous Soils - & they are supplied only
in small quantities & in more due proportion
to the organs of plants. - |_ These soils may
be called rich because little of the organisable
matter thrown into them is lost; whereas the
siliceous soils fully merit their common
name of hungry; for manure is soon destroyed
in them without producing its full effect -
- As different vegetables are nourished in
different manners so they require different
mixtures of Earths & organizable matter. -
- Grasses producing edible grain require a more
absorbent & retentive soil than bulbous [underline]root[/underline]s;
which are usually furnished with a more
extensive system of leaves for absorbing moisture
from the atmosphere - or than Trees, the roots
of which can extend to a great depth in
search of food. -
- I found an excellent potatoe Soil from
Cornwall to consist of 7/8 of siliceous sand. -
And a soil from the park Sheffield place famous
for producing excellent [underline]oaks[/underline]; & taken from

[page]93|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00093|dnp21c091pp|63035688[/page]
91
near the Roots of an immense Oak gave me 6
parts in 7 of sand. - & by an analysis of the
entire soil I found in it 54 parts of silex - &
only 28 of Alumine 3 of carbonate of Lime &
5 oxide of Iron. -
- The standard of the fertility of Soils for
different plants must however vary with
the climate; & must be particularly influ=
=enced by the quantity of rain -
- The power of soils to absorb moisture ought
to be much greater in warm or dry countries
than in cold or moist ones. & the quantity
of aluminous Earth they contain greater -
Soils likewise on declivities ought to be more
absorbent than in plains or in the bottom of
vallies: Their productiveness likewise is
influenced by the nature of the sub-soil
or the stratum on which they rest -
When Soils are immediately situated upon a
bed of rock or stone, they are much sooner
rendered dry by evaporation than where the
subsoil is of clay or marle; & as has been
very justly observed by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Young "a prime
cause of the great fertility of the land in the
moist climate of Ireland is the proximity

[page]94|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00094|dnp21c092pp|63035691[/page]
of the rocky strata to the Soil." -
- A Clayey subsoil will sometimes render a
fertile or sandy [underline]Soil[/underline] & in this case it will
retain moisture in such a manner as to be
capable of supplying, that last by the earth
above in consequence of the action of the
dry atmosphere, upon it. -
- A sandy or a gravelly subsoil often
corrects the imperfections of too great a degree
of tenacity & absorbent power in the true soil. -
- In calcareous Countries the Soil is often
found only a few inches above the Limestone
& its fertility is not impaired by the nearness
of the rock though in a less absorbent [underline]soil[/underline]
this situation would occasion barreness;
& the sandstone & Limestone Hills - in Derbyshire
& N. Wales may be easily distinguished at a
distance by the difference of the vegetation -
the Limestone Hills are Green - The Sandstone
Hills brown - Instance. & the simple
method of improving the sandstone Hills would
be to bring Lime to them. -

Lecture 4.
[underline]Manures[/underline]
- In this lecture I shall endeavour to explain
the principles of the nature & agency of Manures -
& the best methods of applying them - I shall
principally confine myself to chemical considerations.-
- Plants are capable of growing by the [underline]mere[/underline]
[underline]agency[/underline] of Water & of [underline]Air[/underline]; But as I mentioned
in the first lecture the exp.[superscript]ts[/superscript] of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Woodward fully
prove "that in cases when the water is pure
i.e. holds no foreign matters in solution vegetation
is exceedingly feeble " -
- This fact has been shewn more recently by
the researches of M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hassenfratz - His paper may
be found in the "[underline]Annales de Chimie[/underline]" He
made diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. seeds grow & - & He found that
when the water was pure - they were always sickly
& puny & never produced perfect seeds
My Exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
- Turnip seeds in in a soil containing only
the pure Earths watered with distilled water -
The other the same earths with 4 tea teaspoonfulls
of nearly as [underline]3[/underline] to [underline]4[/underline]. -
- A certain proportion of Nutritive matter
must be supplied to plants from the soil

[page]96|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00096|dnp21c094pp|63035695[/page]
in which they grow - On the [underline]method[/underline] of
supplying this the System of Manuring depends
a subject which all others in this department
is most capable of being illustrated by the
 [underline]Principles[/underline] of [underline]Chemistry[/underline]. -
- Possessing no organs of Digestion - plants
are nourished from the Roots only by means of
small capillary vessels not perceptible to the
naked eye & capable of admitting fluid matter
only. -
- No [underline]other substances[/underline] consequently can be
active as [underline]manures[/underline] except such as are in the
liquid form or such as supply principles
soluble in [underline]water[/underline]. -
- Though the forms & appearances of
vegetables are so wonderfully diversified,
yet the elementary principles of which they are
composed are exceedingly analogous & but
few in number. -
- When any [underline]parts of a plant[/underline] or when [underline]all[/underline]
[underline]its parts[/underline] are decomposed by Heat in close
vessels - They evolve more than 2/3 of their

[page]97|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00097|dnp21c095pp|63035698[/page]
95
weight in elastic matter which is water,
fixed air or [underline]Carbonic[/underline] acid & [underline]Hydrocarbonate[/underline]
And what remains in the vessel is [underline]charcoal[/underline]
mixed with minute quantities of earths & salts. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
- This is a simple but at the same time a
beautiful experiment - for it will be found to
elucidate in the highest degree the nature of
the food of plants & the operation of manures
upon them. -
- The great constituent parts are the same
in all cases; but certain plants particularly
those which are the common food of Animals -
produce - Nitrogene, & Ammonia amongst their
volatile products & their ashes contain
phosphate of Lime. -
Barley - Wheat [underline]Turnips Radishes[/underline]
cabbages & [underline]grasses[/underline]. -
- Of the principles of plants a considerable
portion is derived from the Atmosphere by their
leaves - & the remainder from the Soil. -
The substances taken up from the Soil
- The [underline]Substances[/underline] active as manures may be

[page]98|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00098|dnp21c096pp|63035699[/page]
divided into three general kinds -
1. Manures from the decomposition of
vegetable matter. -
2. Animal, -
3. Saline & Earthy compounds. -
- [underline]Vegetable substances[/underline] in their decomposing
state contain the same elements as in
their living state; it is consequently very
easy to conceive them convertible into the
[underline]food[/underline] of growing plants; - The same in
essence there can be no question, but
concerning the form in which they are most
capable of nourishing & the best mode of
their [underline]application[/underline] . -
[underline]Liquidity[/underline] or solubility in Water as I have
said before is absolutely necessary: - And
no matter wholly incapable of decomposition
or solution can ever be the nourishment of
plants. -
- There are a number of substances in the
different parts of plants soluble in water,
but very few of them appear fitted for
the healthy food of crops in their pure or

[page]99|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00099|dnp21c097pp|63035702[/page]
97
unaltered states - Mucilage, Sugar & Gelly
may be procured in solution from almost all
plants; & Extractive matters. Tanning prin=
=ciple. & Gallic acid from the parts of trees
but these substances till they have been submitted
for some time to the action of Air so as to have
undergone a change in their nature seem to
have no beneficial effect - I made an exp.[superscript]t[/superscript]
last year on the effect of these substances in their
pure states & I shall mention the facts &
the general results - I watered from the
14 - to 26 of May some plants of Mint & some
common meadow grass planted in diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. pots,
in garden earths respectively with weak solutions
of the diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. substances that have been named -
& one pot of grass was watered with a solution
of all of them:
Tanning principle Extractive matter
Mucilage, Gelly Sugar Tanning princi[insertion]ple[/insertion]
gallic acid extractive matter.
The effect was certainly pernicious -
parts of the solutions not consumed in these
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. were suffered to remain exposed to Air
till Sept[superscript]r[/superscript]. 5[superscript]th[/superscript] when they had all fermented
changed in colour & acquired a strong musty
smell - I employed them in this state a
fortnight upon pots of Earth filled in this same
way - & they all increased the growth of the
grass except the solutions of extractive matter

[page]100|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00100|dnp21c098pp|63035704[/page]
& of sugar & on examining these I found
sour Vinegar had formed in them. -
- These exp[superscript]ts[/superscript],, convinced me that plants: will
not take up or cannot be nourished by specific
fluids of the same kind as those found in
their living vessels; & that fermentation performs
for them what digestion effects for animals -
provides a food in which the elements are loosely
combined & capable of being easily assimilated
to the living organs. -
- The substances in plants soluble in
water are much more susceptible of fermen=
=tation than those which are insoluble. -
The compounds that I have just mentioned all
decompose in their aqueous solutions when
exposed to air in the course of a few weeks; -
but the resinous & oily parts of plants remain
unalterable for a great length of Time - &
[underline]Woody fibre[/underline] or the fibrous part of plants
when deprived of soluble matter continues
for years very little changed. -
- Pure oil & resinous matters seem very
little capable in their unmixed state of
increasing vegetation. -

- Pure Woody fibre from the best reports seems like=
=wise of little use
- Tanners spent bark the Tan has generally been
found of very little efficacy -
- The soluble parts of plants can in very
few cases be employed unmixed as manure
the only instance that I am acquainted with is
that of the Water of flax & hemp which contains
mucilage & extractive matter & which rapidly
runs into fermentation -
- This M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Billingsley mentions as an [underline]excellent[/underline]
[underline]manure[/underline] -
- I have heard a good account of the use of
water in which flax has been steeped in the
North of Ireland. -
- When the entire parts of plants are submitted
in the moist state to the agency of Air at a
temperature between 50 & 90 - By the reaction
between the fluid & solid parts & the attraction
of Oxygene a speedy change is produced -
much carbonic acid is evolved, & a peculiar
fetid fluid is formed Heat is produced - Water

[page]102|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00102|dnp21c100pp|63035709[/page]
; produced; - & if the process be suffered to
go on. till naturally exhausted nothing
remains but saline & earthy matter with
a [underline]little charcoal[/underline] - & [underline]the same results[/underline]
[underline]are obtained slowly[/underline], & by the operation
of the external elements, as would be
rapidly produced by combustion, & artificial
[underline]Heat[/underline]. -
- It is not at all necessary for fer=
=mentation - That the Vegetable matter
should be in great heaps or masses - The
smallest leaf when exposed under proper cir=
=cumstances undergoes the change - & when
[underline]green grasses[/underline] are ploughed in; the process
takes place as effectually beneath the soil
as if the whole had been [underline]mowed[/underline] & collected
in a great dunghill - the Heat undoubtedly
is less - the process is less vivid but as
much soluble matter is formed &
& less nutritive [space for insertion] is dissipated & lost. -
- Whenever Vegetable Matter is moist &
juicy; - Theory would evidently direct its
immediate use. - & that it should be
ploughed into the Soil as soon as possible -

Pond weeds, the parings of Hedges & ditches, &
sea-weed all ought to be used as soon as possible,
& in these points the best practise (I believe)
accords with Scientific principle. - |_ On the
coast of Cornwall & Devonshire Sea weeds are used
in large quantities particularly as a dressing for
Barley. - the ancient practice was to collect
them in the autumn & winter & make them
into a [space for insertion] with sand - & they were suffered
to remain many months before they were applied -
- Of late years they have ploughed them in fresh.
- & I was informed by some of the most Intelli=
=gent Farmers on the Coast the year before last
that they found the effect of fresh weeds
much greater than an equal quantity of the
fermented weeds -
- Dry, hard & compact Vegetable substances
which contains little soluble matter or which
have been deprived of it by the agency of [underline]Water[/underline]
absolutely require preparation to be rendered
efficient manures & it is necessary that some
substances should be mixed with them to begin
the work of fermentation - Of this kind
are [underline]peat spent Bark chips of wood, Sawdust[/underline]

[page]104|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00104|dnp21c102pp|63035714[/page]
Such substances if ploughed into the land in
their common state would remain for years
& would very slowly decompose. |_& though
they might by their mechanical operation
in some case as in those of stiff clays or
marles improve the texture of the soil yet
in other cases such as those of sands &
gravel soils they would injure it. -
- Inert Vegetable matters are in all cases
brought into a state of quick decomposition
by being mixed with fresh vegetable substances
or with the dung of animals, &
such mixtures there is every reason to believe
would be efficacious if applied to land as
soon as made - In M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Young's "Essay on
Manures" XVo. & which I take the liberty
now of mentioning generally as containing
a capital methodical arrangement of facts
& a comprehensive & precise view of our
knowledge on the subject & there is a great
mass of practical information brought forward
in favour of the [underline]immediate[/underline] application of
stable dung [underline]& litter which[/underline] contain
[underline]inert matter[/underline] mixed [underline]with active matter[/underline];

| but wherever it is found necessary to accumulate
dung & to form Dunghills the greatest care
should be taken to prevent the process of decom=
=position from becoming too rapid or too extensive
- when the Heat is considerable the dung should
be turned over & fresh surfaces exposed to air
& the moment the smell becomes ammoniacal
or putrid the materials should be used or
spread out in smaller heaps - for if the
process be carried on after this effect there is
an immense loss of manure; & the substance
which at first was fluid & an excellent
nourishment becomes destroyed & dissipated
in Gas The method of fermenting [underline]peat[/underline]
- There is a very simple chemical mode of
determining - the fermenting or decomposing powers
of vegetable substances - |_It is directly in
proportion to the quantity of matter that they
contain volatile by Heat - or inversely as the
quantity of charcoal they afford when distilled
- It is on the gaseous elements that their destructi=
=bility depends - & their carbonaceous principle is
comparatively fixed & Antiseptic. -
& Sea weed gives scarcely any coaly residuum;

[page]106|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00106|dnp21c104pp|63035718[/page]
& it wholly decomposes in a few months & when
applied as manure serves only for a single crop -
- Green crops contain infinitely more volatile
than coaly matter in the proportion at least
of from between 20 & 30 to 1 - Rye grass
distilled gave me in the 100 parts only 4 of coaly
residuum. - Clover gave 7 - Peats gave from
1/8 to 1/5 of their weight of residuum - & Oak &
Chesnut sawdust about 1/5 - 100 parts of deal
sawdust gave me 16 of charcoal. -
- [underline]Animal Substances[/underline] in general are much
more liable to decompose than any of the
Vegetable substances - [underline]Their constitution[/underline] is
more complicated & the play of attractions
by which it is produced more easily disturbed;
- Animal substances contain Nitrogene in consi=
=derable proportions - all furnish volatile
alkali by distillation - & give in their
residuum phosphate of Lime & Iron - The
other circumstances of composition are similar
to those of Vegetable matter - Hydrogene &
Oxygene & Charcoal, are their predominant
elements -
- No depth of thought is required to explain
how animal matter can become the food of
plants - Easily susceptible of change it

beautiful part of the Oeconomy of Nature;
that the process of dissolution of one species of
Beings; - is the cause of the life of another

organised is in constant use & circulation. -
- Animal substances require little or no
preparation - All that is necessary is their
diffusion through [underline]the Soil[/underline] in due proportions
- The muscular fleshy or entire parts of
animals principally consist of a matter insoluble
in water called [underline]Fibrine[/underline] It rapidly decom=

the nourishment - The different manures
from Spoiled pilchards Herrings & from
all abound in this substance; their uses & appli=

- [underline]Bones, Hair, Feathers Hornshavings - Wool &[/underline]
[underline]Woolen Rags[/underline] are all similar in composition. -
They contain gelatine & albumen with Phosphate
of Lime. - Gelatine & albumen are
animal substances soluble in water & highly
nutritive |_& all these matters gradually furnish
them to the soil. -
This is the grand cause of their efficacy - & the

residual phosphate of lime must tend not
only to improve the earthy part of the soil,
but is taken up by Wheat Barley & the
plants - & is probably necessary to their
Health -
- These Manures are by far the most
lasting of the animal manures; the compound
of Gelatine & albumen is only very slowly

- In the preservation or application of

rather too slow than too rapid of decomposition

& a mixture with marle or clay would impede
the process & preserve & absorb soluble matter -

- In China where the art of manuring seems
to be most perfectly understood dung is
always made into a with 1/3 of Marle
dried & sold & is one of the most common
articles of commerce of the Empire. -
- Where animal Manures are applied as
top dressing there is great reason to believe
that will in all cases [underline]be useful[/underline], in
preventing too rapid a decomposition, & in
condensing products which would otherwise
pass into the atmosphere. -
- For occasionally applying Manure of every
kind no plan is so philosophically true, or
I believe so practically useful as that practised
by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cooke - in manuring Turnips with rape

- This has produced an immense saving &
the method might be applied to all dry solid

[page]112|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00112|dnp21c110pp|63035731[/page]
The effect is peculiarly great because the
plant is most supplied with food when
it most needs it. in the beginning of its
germination - & it is of the greatest importance
that the early shoot of all crops should be vigorous;
as more nutriment [underline]is collected by the leaves[/underline]: -
& [underline]cold winds or[/underline] the attacks of insects are less

- All the facts upon the subject of vegetation
tend to prove that the manures formed from

their decomposing states into union with the
parts of living plants & are their truly

 They are known to assist vegetation; but our
views of the[deletion]ir[/deletion] mode of operation are as yet
far from being perfect. -
- Many diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. Hypotheses have been formed
to explain the operation of Gypsum, common salt,
various alkaline & neutral Salts, & certain
compounds of iron -
- They have been sometimes considered as operating
by stimulating the vegetable organs & their effects
have been compared to the effects of condiments

been supposed to act by altering the common [underline]food[/underline]

- The [underline]vegetable[/underline] & [underline]mineral alkalies[/underline] or
potash & soda appear when used in small
quantities materially to accelerate vegetation. -
- pearlash ash or potash exists in the ashes of vegetables
& it is in some measure capable of rendering
Charcoal soluble in water so that the great
power of charcoal is compared with that of
pit coal is increasing vegetation as observed
by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Young may in some measure depend
upon the presence of the Alkali in the last
substance. -
- Soda exists in sea weeds their power
as a manure has been already mentioned
& probably partly depends on this substance. -
- The Alkalies very much increase the
solubility of the greater number of vegetable
compounds in water; & potash is found in
a combined state in the sap of all vege=
=tables that have been examined but
neither this substance nor soda seems
immediately essential to the formation of
the vegetable organs. -
- They appear to constitute a medium

- The spoiled or [underline]refuse salt[/underline] from the curing
of fish is a substance in high request in
Cornwall & has a wonderful effect on crops
of wheat; but it contains as well as saline
matter oily substances & the decomposing
parts of Fish. -
- Salt applied in small quantities assists
the process of the decomposition of organised
matter as was first observed by Sir In[superscript]o[/superscript]. Pringle
And its efficacy as a manure is probably
connected with this circumstance as was first
pointed out by the Bishop of Landaff. -
- Salt in large quantities renders the [underline]land[/underline]
[underline]sterile[/underline]; & in this case it would prevent the
decomposition of the dead animal & vege=
=table matter from taking place & the vege=
=table would consequently be deprived of
its appropriate nourishment -
- D[superscript]r[/superscript]. [underline]Pearson[/underline] in a [underline]communication[/underline] to the
Board of Agriculture has given a description
of a peat-ash from Bedfordshire which is
considered as extremely fertilising, He
found it to consist chiefly of vitriol or of
the sul:[superscript]c[/superscript] Acid united to oxide of Iron &
He conjectures that in small quantities it

[page]118|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00118|dnp21c116pp|63035743[/page]
may act as a stimulus on the vegetable organs. -
In time likewise it must be decomposed by
the calcareous Earth in soils & in this case it
would furnish an oxide of Iron whilst the
acid united to lime would compose gypsum. -
- Peats differ very considerably as the
ashes that they give & would consequently
produce very diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. effects in diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. cases. -
- Lord Charleville found much [underline]sulphate[/underline]
[underline]of Potash or vitriolised Tartar[/underline] in some Irish peat. -
- I found in some specimens of peat from [underline]near[/underline]
[underline]Lochness[/underline] much aluminous earth & some
oxide of Iron. -
- The Hampshire peat contains much
Gypsum & a little oxide of Iron. - And
the Berkshire peat-ashes of which I have
analyzed three diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. specimens afford a
very large quantity of [underline]oxide of Iron[/underline] a
certain proportion of gypsum & a small
quantity of mild lime & of muriate of Potash
& sulphate of Potash -
- I found in 100 parts of peat ash from the
pits belonging to C Dundas Esq[superscript]r[/superscript]. about 32 Gypsum [insertion]48 oxide of Iron[/insertion]

These ashes are always used in the Countries where
they are found upon calcareous Soils & they make
an excellent top dressing -
- Upon marles & stiff soils as much as 20
Bushels to the Acre are sometimes used; But upon
light Lands from 10 to 16 Bushels -
- The best red ashes sells for about 7 [superscript]d[/superscript] a Bushel
the whiter ashes which contain more gypsum &
Calcareous matter are reckoned less valuable
& sell for as low as 4[superscript]d[/superscript] & 6[superscript]d[/superscript] - There can
be no doubt that the iron in these ashes is
useful in vegetation -
- I have already mentioned the fertility of
some calcareous red soils. -
- In examining the soil of a field near
Newbury to which the proprietor was about to
apply peat ash by muriatic Acid & prussian
Alkali - I found that there was very little
blue precipitate & consequently very little iron
in the land - Oxide of Iron is found in
the ashes of all plants & may in consequence
of its affinities enable them to attract a larger
quantity of organisable matter from the soil

[page]120|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00120|dnp21c118pp|63035747[/page]
& the Air. -
- It [underline]has likewise[/underline] an agency in rendering
stiff soils less coherent - The powers of
water holding iron in solution are proved
in the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. of irrigation by order of the
Duke of Manchester at Priestly near Woburn.
An account of this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. was read before
the Board in 1804 & the results of it were
witnessed by many of the members at the
Woobourn [underline]sheep-shearing[/underline] of 1804 -
- Great Crops of grass were produced
upon a peat soil which had been drained: by
[underline]watering[/underline] with [underline]a water[/underline] some of which
when analyzed gave me nearly 3/4 of a grain
of oxide of Iron from a pint. - And the
ground seemed every where impregnated with
this substance -
- In considering the general effects of [underline]oxide[/underline]
of [underline]iron[/underline] as a manure the circumstances of
its existence in most lands ought to be attended
to & it ought to be remembered that there
must be a certain dose for different lands
beyond which its [insertion]effects[/insertion] [underline]would be pernicious[/underline]. -

in Iron its application we may conceive
would be [underline]almost always useful[/underline]. -
- I made last year at [underline]Roehampton[/underline] an
exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. on the efficacy of oxide of Iron on [underline]wheat[/underline]
The soil contained about 5[underline]P Cent[/underline] of oxide of iron
& consisted of three parts of sand & one of
light clay - Three square yards were
selected which had been sown [underline]with wheat[/underline]
a full half pound of oxide of Iron was divided
into three equal parts one part was raked
into the [underline]ground alone[/underline] - Another part
was mixed with 4 [unclear]xxx[/unclear] lime - the third with
[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] of Magnesia - & a square yard was
selected which had no manure this was done
in the beginning of [underline]December[/underline] - at the beginning
of April the wheat with iron & magnesia
was [underline] the leaves yellow[/underline]. That with
Iron & lime was greener & better. -
That with Iron alone nearly the same.

Lecture 5.
Limestones & Lime.
- The Nature, the properties & the
mode of operation of Lime & of Limestones have
received full elucidations from the researches of
[underline]Modern Chemistry[/underline]; |_ They are subjects of such
importance in Agriculture that I conceive a
detailed History of the discoveries made upon them,
will not be unacceptable to the Board. -
- All Earthy substances, or Rocks occurring
in considerable masses or beds that effervesce or
emit copiously bubbles, when acids are poured
upon them contain [underline]Lime[/underline]. This is an invariable
character, & may be always depended upon. -
- The [underline]fact[/underline] explains of Limestone & all
calcareous substances - Lime in Nature is
never found pure in all its usual states it is
united to an aerial substance which has
acid properties - I have already mentioned
it under the name of Carbonic acid or fixed Air
- White marble when well burned in a
strong Heat for six or seven hours is then pure
Lime or quicklime - It loses nearly

[page]124|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00124|dnp21c122pp|63035757[/page]
half its weight & what flies off is the carbonic
acid with a little water. -
- When acids are poured upon marble
the effervescence is owing to the escape of the
carbonic acid. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
[underline]attraction[/underline] greater attaction.
And in all cases the pure calcareous substance
of Rocks that effervesces is a compound of
about 45 parts Carbonic acid 5 parts water &
50 parts Lime. -
- The Nature of Limestone may be proved
by compounding as well as by decompounding.
Quicklime is soluble in water & if a solution of
quicklime be poured into a bottle filled with
carbonic acid gas a white precipitate is formed
which is the same as pure powdered marble - &
which is insoluble in water unless that water
be impregnated by the same acid that forms
a part of it. -
- The calcareous substance of rocks is called
by Chemists on account of its being composed

[page]125|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00125|dnp21c123pp|63035759[/page]

of Carbonic acid & Lime [underline]carbonate of Lime[/underline]. -
- Carbonate of Lime when pure is perfectly
white & has uniform qualities - Its specific
gravity is to that of water as 27 [underline]to 10.[/underline] &
in Nature it occurs in crystals having a
form that may always be resolved into the
Rhomboid. -
- Rocks of pure carbonate of Lime are
exceedingly rare - |_In the chemical operations
by which the surface of the globe has been
formed, or modified |_it has usually been
crystallised or consolidated in masses with
other substances from which the varieties of
colour, weight & hardness of calcareous stones
are derived. -
- The colouring matter of Limestone is
in almost all cases the oxide of Iron, now &
then with manganese - When it is so hard
as to be difficultly scratched with a knife
& long in being acted upon by acids the pro=
=perties are generally owing to the presence of
aluminous & siliceous earth & when it is

the word marle is a loose & soft calcareous

is a species of Chalk which when spread
upon Land is soon broken down by Rain

substance - I examined 4 specimens of

129
Marle from diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. pits near Lewes which
had been used for improving the Sandy
soil of Sussex - I found in them from
84 to 92 of Carbonate of Lime, the remainder
principally aluminous with a very little
silex & oxide of Iron. -
- The clay marle of Norfolk seems to
have arisen from the decomposition of Rock
composed of Carb[superscript]e[/superscript]. of Lime, alumine & Iron. -
- The Stone marle such as that of Cheshire
is nothing more than a very pure but soft
[underline]Limestone[/underline]. - & the slate marle is a similar
stratified rock decomposed. -
- Shell marle has been formed from the
degradation & washing down of parts of Lime=

- This is the richest of all the marles for it
abounds not only in calcareous earth but
likewise in organiz[deletion]e[/deletion]able matter. -
- Shell sand differs in its composition

there are many practical observations deduced
from the principles of chemistry applicable

- The present limestones are those that
require the strongest heat to expel the whole

- Carbonate of Magnesia contains more
carbonic Acid than Carbonate of Lime in equal

to this circumstance that the greater loss of
these limestones is owing. -
- When Limestones contain much aluminous
or siliceous earth the fire for burning should
never be suffered to rise to white Heat; for

[page]134|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00134|dnp21c132pp|63035783[/page]
in this case the stones run into a glass

- This happened in an instance in which
an aluminous Limestone in Merionethshire
was burnt in a common kiln. - The
Heat should never be above redness & a damper
should be used at the Air mouth of the kiln

- 5 Lime for one of Coal
- The Theory of the operation & application,
of Lime & calcareous substances, is naturally
deduced from the chemical History. -
- Quicklime in its pure state is noxious
to vegetation & plants die speedily in a
soil containing a considerable quantity of
quicklime. I watered some grass with Lime=
=water three times in the course of a week
in March & it became yellow & sickly &
many plants died. -
- [underline]Quicklime[/underline] destroys living vegetables when
made to act upon them fully - & [underline]it brings[/underline]

modifies its texture & its absorbent powers. -
- The [underline]application[/underline] of Quicklime to Land

- Where [underline]Lime[/underline] is employed as manure
for [underline]wheat[/underline] it seems to act by dissolving

soil so as to render it a fit nutriment
for the plant. -
- It improves peats as well by de=

likewise by improving their texture &

- All [underline]fertile[/underline] Soils contain a certain
proportion of Carbonate of Lime, which
may vary from 5 to 60 in the hundred -
- When quicklime is applied to Land, in
[underline]becoming[/underline] mild it is very intimately united
to the other ingredients of the Soil. & produces
with them an uniform mixture -

mentioned is pernicious when applied to
Land in very large quantities, but in smaller
[underline]quantities is beneficial[/underline]. & in Derbyshire

than the common Limestone
[underline]Lord Somerville[/underline]
Sir [underline]Geo[superscript]e[/superscript]. Beaumont[/underline].
- The reason why it is pernicious in large
quantities & useful in small quantities seems
to be this - Lime has a much stronger
affinity for Carbonic acid than Magnesia:
& [underline]Magnesia[/underline] will remain for years in its
caustic state after burning; - & in this state
it is exceeding posoinous to plants. -
- M[superscript]r[/superscript] Tennant found that cresses would
not grow in pure magnesia & that when

mixed with Soil in considerable quantities
it very much injured their vegetation. -
- But [underline]caustic magnesia[/underline] combines
with decomposing vegetable matter
it seems to possess the same effects as
Lime in rendering them soluble
& an useful manure: & when the
magnesian Lime is employed in such
quantities as to give only that proportion
of Magnesia capable of saturating the
vegetable matter it is highly useful. -
- It is only the uncombined Earth that
is [underline]noxious[/underline] & I have been informed by
an enlightened farmer in [underline]Leicestershire[/underline] that
black & rich Lands would bear more than
pale & poor lands & that it might be
applied in any quantities to [underline]peaty Soils[/underline] -
or to Soils approaching in their nature
to peat & always with good effects. -
- These facts go near to a demonstration
of the opinion I have ventured to form:

Lecture 6.
Nourishment & growth of Plants.
The next objects of enquiry are the processes
of the nourishment & growth of plants -
These are objects which have been very much
elucidated by late researches of physiologists
& Chemists; they offer many beautiful philo=
=sophical truths & afford some applications
which may be of practical utility to Agriculture
- In the sprouting or germination of [underline]seeds[/underline]
the presence of a certain degree of Heat, of water
& of Air is necessary - & without the concurrence
of these agents they are wholly incapable of
growing. -
- The seed consists of three [underline]parts[/underline]. the
great mass of it is formed by the organ of
nourishment which consists either of one [underline]cotyledon[/underline]
or two cotyledons of a radicle or plumala
Instance
- When a [underline]seed[/underline] is placed in contact with moisture
at a temperature above 40 degrees. the epidermis or
coat by which it is surrounded gradually becomes
looser. - Its Cotyledons are enlarged in their
dimensions & elastic fluid is given out from

[page]142|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00142|dnp21c140pp|63035801[/page]
them - In this state the seed is prepared
for germination supplied with [underline]Heat[/underline] & with
[underline]moisture[/underline] it requires only [underline]Atmospherical Air[/underline] to
enable it to evolve its [underline]infant organs[/underline]. -
- If a moistened seed be brought in contact
with a portion of the Atmosphere confined in a
proper vessel it is found that at the time
of sprouting a certain quantity of pure Air
or [underline]oxygene[/underline] is absorbed & that a little
fixed Air or Carbonic Acid is given out by it.
- No germination takes place in vacuo.
in Carbonic Acid, inflammable air, or any
of the airs that do not contain free [underline]oxygene[/underline]
- The first distinct mark of perfect germination
is the development of the [underline]radicle[/underline]. - It may
be distinctly seen in the Garden bean & in the
[underline]Kidney bean[/underline] in cases when they have been
exposed to the proper circumstances in this
stage of the process we examine the Cotyledons
they are found to be considerably enlarged
& by means of a microscope several vessels
may be perceived in them connected with

[page]143|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00143|dnp21c141pp|63035804[/page]
141
the base to which are attached the radicle
& plumula. -
 - The [underline]saccharine matter[/underline] dissolved in
the fluid contained in the vessels of the
Colyledons when they are in this state is
carried into the [underline]plumula[/underline] & by degrees it
causes it to expand & to rise toward the
Atmosphere. -
- Acted upon [insertion]by[/insertion] the solar rays the bud
of the plumula changes from white to green;
& the Colyledons receive a new form & when
carried into the Atmosphere with the stem
are converted into seed leaves. -
- At this stage likewise the radicle is formed
into a root |_ & the plant is developed in a
perfect organised form -
- The action of chemical attraction assisted
by the living powers of the plant produces
those alterations in water & Air by which their
elements are united to the Vegetable organs; -
- All the parts of the seed at first absorb
moisture from the soil & oxygene of the [underline]Atmosphere[/underline]

[page]144|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00144|dnp21c142pp|63035806[/page]
|_ but when germination has been completed a cir=
=culation of fluids is established in the vessels
of the plant & a new order of changes take [underline]place[/underline]
Water & the organizable matter of the soil are
then absorbed chiefly by the fibres of the [underline]radicle[/underline]
they are carried into the [underline]seed leaves[/underline] & after
being modified by the action of light & air
are made to pass into the bud of the plumula.
|_ If the infant plant be deprived of the seed
leaves as soon as it appears above the soil
it will grow with but little vigour & will
become a dwarf from three to nine times less
than the parent plant - . But if after
the plumula has expanded into perfect [underline]leaves[/underline]
the seed leaves be removed no injury will
follow. These organs are no longer useful
& their functions are supplied by other parts
of the plant Instance.
- In diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. vegetables the immediate
appearances of Vegetation are very diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. but
the general process is in all cases nearly the same.
- In the plants containing but one Cotyledon
no seed leaves are formed but the sugar essential

[page]145|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00145|dnp21c143pp|63035809[/page]
143
to the nourishment of the plumula is produced
as in other instances & it is deposited at the
base of the rising stem. -
- Wheat for instance has only one Cotyledon
& when it is sown in the end of Autumn,
saccharine matter is immediately formed in
the seed a plumula is evolved consisting
of a single stalk |_ & a radicle shoots
downward which continues through but the
winter, merely a single set of fibres; but
in the warmth of the spring the sugar at the
base of the plumula becomes the nourishment
of a new set of roots; which shoot out
above the Cotyledon, & likewise of a new
series of leaves which rise vigorously at
the base of the plumula & which become
distinct seed bearing stalks - This is
called Tillering & one of the great effects
of Hoeing in the drill system is that of
occasioning a second production of Roots
& stalks after the first has taken place. -
- When the moist Earth is thrown round the
lower joint of a stalk, so as to prevent the

[page]146|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00146|dnp21c144pp|63035811[/page]
agency of light & to supply it with moisture
saccharine matter is formed abundantly in it
& it becomes the source of nourishment to a
new series of roots & stalks. -
- And the stalks & roots may be separated
from each other & made repetition of the process
to produce new suckers; & this is done in
 transplanting wheat, by which a [underline]Wonderful[/underline]
[underline]increase[/underline] is occasioned. -
- In the Phil: Trans: N.[superscript]o[/superscript] 58 P203 the followin[superscript]g[/superscript]=
statement may be found - "M[superscript]r[/superscript] C Miller of
Cambridge sowed some seed on the second of
June 1766 & on the 8[superscript]th[/superscript] of Aug[superscript]t[/superscript] a plant was
taken & separated to 18 parts & replanted -
these plants again were taken up & divided
in the Months of Sept[superscript]r[/superscript] & Oct[superscript]r[/superscript]. & planted separa=
=tely to stand the Winter - which division
produced sixty seven plants" -
- "They were again taken up in March
& April & produced five hundred plants
the number of ears thus formed from one grain
of wheat was 21109 which gave 3 pecks

[page]147|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00147|dnp21c145pp|63035813[/page]
145
& 3 quarterns of corn that weighed 47[superscript]lbs[/superscript] - 7[superscript]oz[/superscript]
& that were estimated at 576. 840 grains. -
- In wheat which has been sown in
the spring the same process of germination
takes place, but as there is no accumulation
of saccharine matter in the plumula
ready to produce new organised parts the
grain is seldom so fair & full. But, Though
a number of grains of spring wheat will
not weight nearly so much as an equal
number of grains of winter wheat yet the
real quantity of [underline]nutritive matter[/underline] in equal
weights in some instances seems to be greatest
in spring grain. -
- At the request of Sir J Banks I made
an analysis of two specimens of wheat -
one of the finest & fullest of the winter grain
of 1804 - The other of the spring grain -
100 parts of the [underline]winter wheat[/underline] gave 19 gluten
& about - 75 Starch
The Spring Wheat gave 24 gluten
& - 68 or 9 Starch
And gluten is the most nutritive part

[page]148|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00148|dnp21c146pp|63035815[/page]
of the Corn so that if it should be
found that spring wheat is less liable
to mildew than winter wheat as Sir J.
seems inclined to believe there will be
little disadvantage in the cultivation of it. -
- Many seeds are enveloped in their
natural state by a considerable quantity
of easily decomposable vegetable matter
as for instance the greater number of our
[underline]fruits[/underline] - Where this vegetable matter is
buried with them beneath the [underline]soil[/underline], it
promotes [underline]germination[/underline] & becomes a species
of manure to the infant [underline]plant[/underline]. -
- In all cases when the seeds of fruits
are sown the pulp should be suffered to
adhere to them for otherwise the germination
in comparatively slow & the first shoot
of the plumula weak & diseased
|_ - In mildewed [underline]wheat[/underline] the plumula &
radicle are in as perfect a state as in full
wheat; but the colyledons contain much
less nourishment. I found by analysis in

[page]149|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00149|dnp21c147pp|63035817[/page]
147
the mildewed wheat of 1804 only 13 parts
of gluten & 52 Starch & the insoluble &
earthy matter amounted to 35 - There would
be much less food for the Germ - whether
this would interfere materially with the crop
can only be determined by experiment. it
would certainly prevent the first shoot
from being vigorous. -
- Before the colyledons have fully ex=
=panded the presence of light is detrimental
to germination & the process takes place with
the greatest rapidity in darkness beneath the
soil |_ Independently of this circumstance
no receptacle can be so proper for the seed
as moistened Earth for it is extremely perme=
=able to [underline]air[/underline]. and as water is required by
the colyledons only in small quantities
at a time, the absorbent powers of the
Earth prevent it from being supplied to
their organs, except in a very slow & gradual
manner. -
- The agents concerned in [underline]germination[/underline]

[page]150|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00150|dnp21c148pp|63035819[/page]
are few, & the effects are simple, |_though
we are unable to trace with precision:
the minute chemical changes connected
with the production of new organs, the
general facts of the absorption of water
& oxygene by the [underline]seed[/underline] - the formation of
sugar & its power of nourishing & of
producing the expansion of the plumula;
are sufficiently distinct |_& in a process
in which living powers are concerned
we can scarcely even hope to discover
all the relations of facts belonging to
the subject; & much of the theory must
necessarily depend upon the analogical
conclusions. -
- The growth of the perfectly organised
plant depends upon causes diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. from
those that produce its germination; new
functions arise with the production of new
parts & the alterations in its composition
& its structure are various & diversified.

[page]151|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00151|dnp21c149pp|63035821[/page]
149
- The organs in the rising vegetable
that are most essential to its nourishment
are the vessels in the alburnum or [underline]Sap[/underline]
[underline]wood[/underline]; which extend in all cases from the
extremity of the leaves to the minutest
fibres of the [underline]roots[/underline]. -
Instance.
|_Numerous experiments demonstrate "[underline]that[/underline]
[underline]the ascent of the fluids through these vessels[/underline]
[underline]is immediately connected with vegetation[/underline]
[underline]& with the life of the plant[/underline]"
- The bark of a tree may be cut or
even stripped off from the trunk without
materially impeding the growth of the branches
above or below. -
- But when the alburnum is cut
through so that the fluid in the vessels
can no longer pass beyond a certain height;
all the parts of the plant above the incision
speedily die - This is shewn by the
exper[superscript]ts[/superscript]. of D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Walker of Edinburgh & confirmed
by those lately established by [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person]
the bark of a tree may be cut or
fibres of the roots

[page]152|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00152|dnp21c150pp|63035823[/page]
in the Phil: Trans. -
- The sap may be traced in its
progress through the alburnum towards
the leaves - For if at the time of the
rising of the sap a number of orifices be
made in the tree, the sap first begins
to flow from the lowest opening - then
from the lowest but one, |_& so on succes=
=sively, till at last it makes its appear=
=ance in the highest of all - And
when Bonnet made plants grow in coloured
liquids the tinging matter which was
deposited in the wood appeared first
in the lowest part of the alburnum, &
gradually ascended higher & higher till
at last it reached the top of the tree
& tinged even the extremities of the leaves. -
- The rise of the sap in trees depends
partly upon capillary attraction; But
the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]. of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hales though made with a very
diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. end shew that this power alone is
not sufficient to elevate it to a considerable
height above the vessels. -

The following fact may be found in the Vegetable
Statics N[superscript]o[/superscript]. 1. P. 112. "A vine branch of four
or five years old was cut through & a
glass tube carefully attached to it, this
tube was best as a siphon & filled with
quicksilver, & it was found in the course
of a few days that a column of [underline]Quicksilver[/underline]
had been raised by it 38 inches high which
is a force equal to that [insertion]135/190[/insertion] which would raise

& expansions of the silver in the alburnum
are the most immediate causes of the ascent

in ingenious & countenanced by striking facts
|_ [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] K[/person] found that very slight changes of
temperature were sufficient to cause the
fibres of the silver grain to separate from

of the sap in the pores of the wood in contact
with the silver grain. -

- The rise of the sap as is evident from

[page]154|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00154|dnp21c152pp|63035827[/page]
many experiments of the same Author is

- Some young seedling Apple Trees in
the spring of 1801 were planted in the

parts of the stems of some of them were
deprived of the power of motion by means
of bandages of Hay, whilst the upper branches
remained in their natural states. -
- It was found in the succeeding summer that
much new wood had accumulated in the stalk
where the parts were kept in motion by the
wind; whilst the lower part had increased
but very little |_ [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] explains from these
facts the peculiarity of the forms of mountain
Trees as compared with those that grow

in them by the motion of the lower parts of
the Trunk. |_Its ascent is impeded; hence
lateral branches will be produced; the
forms of which will be similar to that

of the trunk |_ & the insulated & exposed
tree will be as we always find it, low
& sturdy & well calculated to resist the
heavy gales to which it is continually liable
- The rise of the sap takes place prin=
=cipally in the spring & autumn when
changes of temperature are most frequent
when there is the greatest supply of fluid
matter to the soil connected with the
greatest power of evaporation from the leaves;
& this must be a continued cause of the de=
=termination of the fluids upwards -
- Likewise the saline & vegetable matters
contained in soils are much more soluble
in warm weather. -

vegetables as yet is but little known
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Vauquelin found in the sap of the Birch
mucilage sugar & a neutral salt consisting
of acetous Acid united to the vegetable
Alkali. -
- In the Hornbeam the water of the

[page]156|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00156|dnp21c154pp|63035831[/page]
sap was ascertained to hold in solution
chiefly mucilage & saline matter - And
in the Elm & the Beech it was likewise
united to astringent substances. - All
these saps when exposed for some time to Air
were found to have deposited [underline]solid matter[/underline]
- The general tendency of some of the
constituent principles of the sap to solidify
is proved indeed by many diff[superscript]t[/superscript]. experiments.
- Mucilage Tannin or the astringent prin=
=ciples or even certain of the vegetable acids
when exposed to the oxygene of the air
slowly unite to it & are converted into
substances analagous to woody fibre. -
- In our artificial processes by applying
oxygene in a form of fluid [underline]combination[/underline] to
a vegetable [underline]juice[/underline]; we in almost all cases
occasion a considerable deposition of solid
matter
Instance vegetable matter of the Oak
[underline]Nitrous acid[/underline]
- These facts are extremely applicable to the
modification which the sap undergoes in the
[underline]Alburnum[/underline]. -

- On the surface of the [underline]Alburnum[/underline] it is exposed
to the action of the oxygenated fluid descending
in the bark from the leaves - & it is here
that it is partly condensed in an organised
[underline]form[/underline] & made a permanent part of the [underline]plant[/underline].
- In cases when the bark is removed the
Alburnum is immediately exposed to the
oxygene of the Atmosphere & in consequence
the same effect takes place & new wood
is [underline]produced[/underline]. -
- When a tree has been stripped
of a ring of bark it is seen that the
new bark forms only upon the Alburnum
at the upper part of the wound & extends
gradually toward the lower part. -
This [underline]demonstrates[/underline] the motion of the sap [deletion]toward[/deletion]

been brought forward to shew that "the
Alburnum is not necessary to the formation
of the bark; but that the bark is essential
to the formation of wood" but this opinion

[page]158|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00158|dnp21c156pp|63035836[/page]
is not supported by the fact.
Instance.
- The accurate experiments have been made
concerning the nature of the [underline]descending sap[/underline]
- When the barks of timber trees are exam"[superscript]d[/superscript]
they are found to contain chiefly mucilage
& astringent matters, & that part of these
substances were in solution in the sap
is evident from the circumstance that
they are found in much greater abundance
in the barks of trees stripped in spring than
in those of trees stripped in winter & hence
all barks for the use of Tanning are pro=
=cured if possible in the former season. -
- It would be a considerable benefit
to the manufacture of [underline]leather[/underline], if any tree
or shrub could be found which might
be raised more rapidly than the Oak
& which would afford the tanning substance.
- For at present the article is [insertion]very[/insertion] scarce; & very
dear; & Oak trees are consequently con=
=tinually cut for Bark before they are fit
for wood to the prejudice perhaps of the

[page]159|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00159|dnp21c157pp|63035838[/page]
157
naval interests of the country - much
Bark is imported from Germany & the
North: |_[underline]&[/underline] the high price of leather is
immediately connected with the high price
of Bark. -
- There is a very simple method of
determining the proportion of the Tanning
principles in any wood or bark by
means of a solution of isinglass or glue. -
- All substances that contain the Tanning
[underline]principle[/underline] when warm water has been
poured on them & suffered to remain in
contact with them for some time precipitate
the [underline]solution[/underline] of glue or isinglass. i.e. they
form a compound with it upon which Water
has no action. - And this compound
if collected upon a piece of blotting paper
dried & weighed may be considered as con=
=taining about 45 p[superscript]r[/superscript] cent of the Tan[superscript]g[/superscript]. principle.
- That the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. may be made with due
precision a half a pint of boiling water should
be used to an ounce of Bark or of the

[page]160|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00160|dnp21c158pp|63035840[/page]
substance supposed to contain the Tan[superscript]g[/superscript]. principle -
- The infusion obtained should be mixed
with a half pint of a solution containing
a quarter of an ounce of Glue or isinglass
dissolved in boiling water. -
- The solid substance formed indicates
the Tanning power. -
- The bark is judged to be more excellent
in proportion as there is a larger quantity
of new alburnum immediately beneath it
This is called by the strippers the [underline]card[/underline] &
it appears only in very small quantities
when the spring has been unusually cold
in which case the cortical layers contain
a much smaller proportion of the Tan[superscript]g[/superscript].
principle -
- As the [underline]roots[/underline] are the great organs
by which plants receive nourishment
from the soil, so the leaves are the parts
by which they receive food from the
atmosphere & by which it is rendered

[page]161|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00161|dnp21c159pp|63035842[/page]
159
proper for assimilation. -
- There are a number of experiments
which shew that plants do not vegetate
when deprived of leaves. -
Du Hamel stripped the bark of a tree
off in the winter [underline]leaving[/underline] five or six
rings of it at some [underline]distance[/underline] from each
other; [underline]with no[/underline] bark in the intervals, some
of these rings had buds & leaves & they
increased considerably in size; but others
which had neither buds nor leaves under=
=went no change. -
- [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Knight[/person] stripped off all the leaves
from a shoot of the vine & he found that
it speedily died. -
- I have been informed by L[superscript]d[/superscript]. Sheffield
that some years ago in Sussex when a
great blast deprived a number of Oaks
of part of their leaves - That many died -
that more became stagheaded & that a few
only recovered perfectly from the effect
- [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Knight[/person] considers the lower part

[page]162|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00162|dnp21c160pp|63035844[/page]
of the leaf as the surface by which moisture
is perspired |_ but it appears from the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of
Bonnet that under certain circumstances this
surface is capable of absorbing moisture &
the power of acting upon elastic fluid is like=
=wise probably principally confined to it. -
- When a plant is exposed to a fastidious
atmosphere containing a certain proportion of
carbonic acid, being under proper circumstances
with regard to Heat & light it is found
after a certain time that a part of the
carbonic acid is absorbed; but the oxygene
gas is not diminished. -
- In the direct beams of the Sun the
leaves of plants appear to absorb water &
carbonic acid by their under surface &
give out oxygene gas -
- If we immerse a living plant under
water the production of oxygene gas will
be seen to take place from the surfaces of
its leaves; & if the water be saturated
with carbonic acid the effect will be
much increased -

[page]163|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00163|dnp21c161pp|63035846[/page]
161
- It would appear that in the process
of the Healthy vegetation of leaves the water
& carbonic acid received from the atmosphere
united to the principles conveyed by the sap
were partly deprived of oxygene in the
parynchyma by the agency of light; &
rendered more proper to be converted into
inflammable products - And by the
beautiful process of the decomposition of
water & carbonic acid not only carbon &
hydrogene are furnished to [underline]plants[/underline]. but
oxygene gas a principle absorbed in their
germination is supplied again to the [underline]Atmosphere[/underline]
- When a plant is kept for a considerable
length of time in darkness or a very shady
place it is found to render the air in
contact with it in a slight degree impure. -
- It becomes by degrees diseased & gives out
carbonic acid that substance which in
health was an essential part of its nourishment
- In a state of disease produced by a defi=
=ciency of light the leaves & branches lose their
green colour & become white or yellow a
small quantity of inflammable matter only

[page]164|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00164|dnp21c162pp|63035847[/page]
is formed in them & they are found to
contain an excess of oxygene. -
- Examples of this kind may be seen in
Ending & in the lettuces when they have been
made to grow too thickly together - &
there is always a deficiency of colour
in the interior leaves of buds. -
- A considerable quantity of the solid
matter of all plants is supplied by the
absorption from the leaves, & it has been
found in a number of instances in which
small [underline]shrubs[/underline] have been placed in
vessels containing water that there
has been great increase of weight
notwithstanding the [underline]evaporation[/underline] from
the plant, & the surface of the fluid -
- It is well known that the branches
of a tree in the winter introduced into
a [underline]Hothouse[/underline] will speedily evolve leaves;
whilst the parent plant exposed to the
cold atmosphere continues unchanged -
- The fact shews that a great part

[page]165|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00165|dnp21c163pp|63035850[/page]
163
of the food essential to healthy vegetation
may be supplied from the air but in this
case there is likewise a of sap
to that part in which the temperature
is increased -
- The flowers of plants are [underline]nourished[/underline]
by the sap transmitted through the
vessels of the flower stalk & the [underline]Calyx[/underline]
& the [underline]petals[/underline] seem subservient to the
preparation of this sap for the uses of
the Anthers & pistil - If we examine
the juice in the stalks of grapes before
the seed begins to be formed it is found
very sweet & contains a considerable
proportion of sugar - but after the seed
is produced the sweet taste is lost &
the sugar seems converted into farina
- The presence of light & of a moderate
degree of Heat are essential to the process
& it partly depends upon the deoxygena=
=tion of the [underline]sugar[/underline]. -
- Bulbous roots are supplied with

[page]166|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00166|dnp21c164pp|63035852[/page]
nourishment, by their fibrils in the same
manner as the stalk of a common tree. -
- Thus in the potato, immediately
beneath the skin, [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Knight[/person] traced a
substance analogous to the [underline]alburnum[/underline]
into which coloured fluid passed from
 the fibrils of the roots |_ & He conceives
"that the new matter formed in the
fleshy part chiefly by the ascending
juices of these vessels is modified by
the descending fluid in the cortical
substance of the skin & converted
into nutritive substance. -
- In annual plants after the seed
has been formed the functions of diff[superscript]t[/superscript]
organs are in most cases compleated
the principle of life of the vegetable
becomes exhausted. -
- The Flowers and leaves decay. the
wood & bark slowly undergo decom=
=position & nothing remains of the
beautiful series of organs but the germs

[page]167|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00167|dnp21c165pp|63035854[/page]
165
which are to become the parents of a
new generation of [underline]plants[/underline]. -
- In trees & in perennial vegetables
the buds resemble annual plants in their
production & decay but the wood & the
bark continue to grow & are constantly
enlarging in their dimensions. -
- It was supposed by Linneaus that
"the bark of one year becomes the alburnum
in the next year," but this opinion
seems now pretty generally [underline]relinquished.[/underline]
- A new bark & a new alburnum
are as would seem from the most accurate
experiments produced every year & the
greater firmness & solidity of the Heart wood
depends in a great measure upon the
compression of its fibres during the pro=
=duction of this exterior bark of the tree
|_ & the epidermis becomes cracked & the
exterior cortical layers loose & less dense,
in consequence of the expansion occasioned
by the successive generation of inner bark.
- The decay of the interior wood is

[page]168|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00168|dnp21c166pp|63035856[/page]
the only natural cause that limits
the size & the age of trees |_& in proportion
as the wood is firmer the duration of
the tree is longer - The Oak, the Cedar,
& the Chesnut have been known to live
for many ages but the period of the
existence of most other trees is much
shorter; & the duration of our common
fruit trees is seldom much beyond a century
- A very curious & important discovery
with regard to the growth of perennial
plants & trees, has been lately made by
M[superscript]r[/superscript]. A Knight which has thrown great
light upon the whole of the theory
of vegetation, & with an account of
which I shall conclude the lecture: -
- [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript]. K[/person] - has found that "the
nutritive matter of the sap which
has not been consumed during the
summer remains in the alburnum in
an unaltered state during the winter
& affords a store of nutritive matter
for the first development of buds, leaves

[page]169|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00169|dnp21c167pp|63035859[/page]
167
& flowers in the spring." - |_ [person]person_024|M[superscript]r[/superscript] K[/person] -
tapped several trees in diff.[superscript]t[/superscript] places
at the time the sap was beginning
to rise & He found that in proportion
as the sap was taken from a high part
of the trunk or branches, so in proportion
it was found of greater specific gravity
& more loaded with saccharine matter. -
- M[superscript]r[/superscript]. K - has made a general appli=
=cation of his principles - |_In [underline]plants,[/underline]
that have [underline]bulbous[/underline] roots the nourish=
=ment derived from the Autumnal
sap is laid up in the fleshy part
of the root; & hence they are prepared
to shoot forth the moment the warmth
of spring begins its actions upon their
of spring begins its action upon their
living parts. -
- In annual plants there is no system
of organs for the reception of the nutritive
matter of the sap & the whole of the
contents of the sap vessels appear to be
exhausted in the formation of the seed"
- It is evident on these facts that

[page]170|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00170|dnp21c168pp|63035861[/page]
perennial Grapes ought never to be cropt
very close in the end of Autumn - for
in this case the saccharine matter which
would have been their first nourishment
in the spring will be destroyed; & they
will rise feebly & with difficulty: -
- It is on the same principle that
the tuberous part of the potato ought
never to be cut off round the bud or
eye - for it is in this case deprived of
the greatest part of that matter which
would have afforded to it an essential
nourishment & at the time when it is
most needed & when the powers of the
[underline]roots are[/underline] most feeble. -
- I have already mentioned that many
of the substances found in vegetables are
convertible into such other & that they
differ principally not as to the nature
of their elements but as to the properties
of them. - So that Sugar Tan[superscript]g[/superscript]. principle
resin mucilage & woody fibre are all

[page]171|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00171|dnp21c169pp|63035864[/page]
169
congenerous as to the primitive matter
that composes them. -
- On the subject of the constitution of
vegetable substances a very important
exp.[superscript]t[/superscript] has been made within these few
weeks by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatchett. This Gent.[superscript]n[/superscript] has been
able to produce the Tanning principle by
distilling Nitrous Acid or aqua fortis from
charcoal - which seems to shew that the
tanning principle is merely a compound
of charcoal & pure Air or oxygene &
of course that its elements differ only
in proportion from those of Carbonic acid
[underline]Instance[/underline]
This fact is in the highest degree interesting
for it may not only lead to immediate
oeconomical applications but may perhaps
point out to us a method of imitating
other vegetable substances. -
- The Tanning principle a little altered
in its nature assumes forms similar to those
of woody fibre, mucilage & extract, And
researches of this kind when multiplied to
a [underline]great extent[/underline] will not only enlighten

[page]172|MS-DAVY-12103-000-00172|dnp21c170pp|63035866[/page]
the Theory of vegetation but afford
very useful applications to the general
system of practical Agriculture. -
