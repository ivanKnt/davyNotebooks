Journal 1819.<lb/>
I have resolved to keep a journal of the<lb/>
journey I am about to make. I have felt<lb/>
that through life I have lost many thoughts<lb/>
that were worth preserving, not only for my<lb/>
own amusement, but for the amusement of others<lb/>
I believe I have often made observations and<lb/>
combinations that were new, at least I never met<lb/>
with them in books, and the present state of<lb/>
society and of knowledge is different from<lb/>
any that ever existed. Man has made a<lb/>
wonderful progress in physical knowledge:<lb/>
there are many profound thinkers in every thing<lb/>
belonging to the progress of political improve-<lb/>
-ment; but the governors of the world are children<lb/>
compared with their servants. The useful acts<lb/>
have made a much greater progress than at<lb/>
any former period; and the imaginations of<lb/>
men subdued by the sense of utility, no<lb/>
longer kindles into poetry, or freezes in<lb/>
profound metaphysics. A few scintillations<lb/>
shine in the gloom; but the public consider<lb/>
            <lb/>

and the persons who possess them as incendiaries<lb/>

Is the melancholy and debility produced<lb/>
by sickness favourable to intellectual<lb/>
exertion? I believe so. The mind necessarily<lb/>
becomes contemplative when the body is no<lb/>
longer active, and the empire of sensation<lb/>
yields to that of imagination. Under such<lb/>
circumstances, likewise, the mind is sober<lb/>
and disposed to discover realities, and values<lb/>
quiet and comfort, more than pomp and<lb/>
eclat. During the last fortnight I have seen<lb/>
and felt some novelties; yet but for the<lb/>
wretched state of body in which I am,<lb/>
they probably would never have been<lb/>
committed to paper.<lb/>

roast veal; and last of all cranberry jelly<lb/>

stormy, with a bright sun, and a road which<lb/>
was covered with clouds of dust. The travelling<lb/>
is cheap enough: 16 shillings in the Country<lb/>

I killed two more: altogether I hooked 9<lb/>

not 6 pounds, and some of them were I think<lb/>

bears to masses, and assignable quantities<lb/>

presence of Deity was an imagination<lb/>

mere delusions of the human mind,<lb/>

this indeed is in accordance with<lb/>
the Divine wisdom and power, as it<lb/>

Revolutions<lb/>
Every thing good in society has<lb/>
arisen from gradual reform and<lb/>
progressive change. When the leaves<lb/>
of a tree are blighted it kills the<lb/>
tree to pluck them off. Decayed<lb/>
leaves are better than no leaves at<lb/>
all. They should be suffered to perform<lb/>
their imperfect functions till they are<lb/>
thrown off by the vigour of young<lb/>
and healthy leaves.<lb/>
The magnificence of a court as long<lb/>
as funds can be found, and as long<lb/>
as the money is entirely expended in<lb/>
the country, is like brilliant sunshine<lb/>
which in Spring and Summer raises<lb/>
the sap, causes it to circulate, the<lb/>
leaves to sprout, and the fruit to ripen,<lb/>
but in Autumn when the plant no<lb/>

the soil, it withers, dries up, and is<lb/>

To raise money in a Country, and<lb/>
spend that money out of it, is like<lb/>
carrying off corn crops from a soil:<lb/>
it must soon become barren.<lb/>
We hear the thunder; and unless we<lb/>
examine into the cause of it, some<lb/>
great catastrophe many take us<lb/>
unawares. We must enquire whether<lb/>
it is from the heavens or the earth;<lb/>
whether if is caused by a tempest, which<lb/>
may soon be dissipated; or whether<lb/>
it is the forerunner of a volcanic<lb/>
eruption, which may deluge us with<lb/>
burning lava, not with transient rain,<lb/>
and destroy for ever are wealth, our<lb/>
cities, &amp; our palaces.<lb/>

These fiends of revolution do not,<lb/>
like powerful spirits ride in the<lb/>
whirlwind and direct the storm; they<lb/>
are generally the first victims of it<lb/>
In endeavouring to sap the foundations<lb/>
of the building, they merely detach<lb/>
some of its loose gothic ornaments<lb/>
which fall on their heads, and destroy<lb/>
the intermeddler.<lb/>
That there is great distress, and<lb/>
great discontent in the Country, is<lb/>
at present a truth universally admitted<lb/>
Even those persons who are most disposed<lb/>
to hope, and to see objects in sunshine<lb/>
consider the present crisis not only<lb/>
as replete with difficulty and danger,<lb/>
but as leading to despair. There is<lb/>
a cloud hanging over us, and persons<lb/>
are as much divided in opinion with<lb/>

respect to the causes as the consequences<lb/>
of it. Some regard it merely a summer<lb/>
cloud resulting from the sunshine of our<lb/>
peace; others as a winter cloud depending<lb/>
upon the chill of our taxation: some<lb/>
expect it to be disrespected in a transient<lb/>
shower: and others hail it as the fore-<lb/>
-runner of a deluge which is to sweep<lb/>
away our harvests and to destroy our<lb/>
habitations. In such a season it is<lb/>
natural to look to the government, not<lb/>
only for information, but for comfort:<lb/>
but the persons of the head of affairs<lb/>
seem as little able to afford the one<lb/>
as the other. They have indeed talked<lb/>
about the inconvenience resulting from<lb/>
a transition to peace from war, and<lb/>
the impatient ignorance of the people<lb/>
with regard to taxation: but such<lb/>
opinions, vague, unsatisfactory, and insolent<lb/>
            <lb/>
            <pb xmlns:conf="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/ns/digital-library/config/1.0"

 confidence. The peace they have given<lb/>
us may indeed be represented by an<lb/>
invented and empty cornucopia, and<lb/>
the miserable are not likely to be<lb/>
soothed by being accused of impatience.<lb/>
To expect remedies from Physicians<lb/>
who are ignorant of the nature of<lb/>
the disease they undertake to cure<lb/>
is absurd. Nature and a good<lb/>
Constitution might conquer the malady<lb/>
but it is not likely that natural means<lb/>
will be allowed, and the constitution<lb/>
has been already tampered with: the<lb/>
patient under such circumstances is<lb/>
right to find other physicians, or to<lb/>
give up physic altogether.<lb/>

In minds of great power, there is<lb/>

pursuits; and they often attempt all<lb/>
branches of letters and science, and<lb/>
even the imitative arts; but if they<lb/>
become truly eminent, it is by devotion<lb/>
to one object at a time, or at most<lb/>
two objects. This sort of general power<lb/>
is like a profusion of blossoms on a<lb/>

strength; but if all are suffered to<lb/>
become fruit, all are feeble and bad:<lb/>
but when the greater portion is destroyed<lb/>

We have no idea of the creation of<lb/>

great change produced in the matter of<lb/>
the globe by water, and which seems to<lb/>
have preceded the present order of things.<lb/>
A change produced by fire would have<lb/>

intelligence, a mere chrystalline arrangement<lb/>
the result of the chemical attractions of<lb/>
 matter. That this was the state of the<lb/>

first appearance of the animals, whose<lb/>
