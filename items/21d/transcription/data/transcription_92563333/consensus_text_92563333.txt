grayling, in a little stream of beautiful
clearness tributary to the Drave. The inn
did not tempt me, nor the offer of shewing
me some hares to shoot, made by the Innkeeper
and I went through the same kind of scenery
to Greiffenburg, where I found a good inn
and had a Hucho of about 2lbs and a half for
dinner. It is like an ill fed trout, but
has no spots; is much longer, and perfectly
silvery. Its skin remarkably thick, its taste
hardly different from that of the trout: it
did not colour much, but probably it was 24
hours old. The Hucho that I eat at Gratz
last year coloured like Salmon. I walked
by the side of a beautiful stream that rose
up through a glen covered with pines and
fell over rocks, making some fine cascades.
The valley here is well cultivated, extremely
green and the haymaking going on. I tried
in rain for Hucho; but seeing a land rail
and hearing some quails, I brought down
the dogs, found the land rail and shot it
