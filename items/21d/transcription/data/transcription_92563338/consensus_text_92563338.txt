any bosoms. I did not observe the goitre
much in the valley of the Upper Drave;
but here, and on entering the valley of the
Muhl, it becomes so common, that every
second woman has it, at least those past
25. The Corinthian women have less
bosom than either the English, French or
Italians; fine arms, which they expose and
fair hair, I once thought a part of the
Italian character, their indifference to human
life, depended upon their constant familiarity
with statues, images, and pictures, in which
death and wounds are represented: but in
the Tyrol [insertion]wooden images of[/insertion] Christ and the two thieves as
large as life, and with blood and wounds
in abundance [insertion]are constantly seen on the roads[/insertion] yet this people is freest of
all from the crime of assassination. I think
the exposure of the human body and
face as we see in Italy at funerals
has a bad effect on the mind.
