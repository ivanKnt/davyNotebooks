valley of the Save, and is rich in pasture
with clumps or hedge rows of trees, walnuts
ash, elms, chesnuts, limes, & beeches. It is
like an English Noblemans park, with an
intermixture of carn, clover & maize.
There is a fine cliff to the right, topped
by a picturesque castle, and one range
of broken hills, and from disti[insertion]n[/insertion]ct ranges
of mountains, the last the [unclear]xxx[/unclear] [insertion]bare[/insertion] and snowy
Terglon. Through the valley the Sava
winds, and the meeting of the two waters
one bright blue, the other sea green, is
distinctly seen: the lowest hills have
the same vegetation as the plain, the
next range oak and beech; the third
pines, the fourth pines and bare rocks,
the fifth without any appearance of
vegetation, cliffs of marble, or masses of
snow. By the sides, or upon the base
of the hills are seen beautiful villages
with white spires rising amidst the trees
