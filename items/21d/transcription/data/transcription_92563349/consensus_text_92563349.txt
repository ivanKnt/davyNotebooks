The waller I have just eaten (2 OClock; -
for I have adopted the dining habits of the

it pre-eminent - very like a whiting, softer
than a barbot, but good and clean tasted.
The wine of Carniola is excellent both
here and at Adelsburg and Planina;
it is probably the same, for they call it
"[underline]welsh[/underline]" which I presume means [underline]foreign[/underline]; it
is certainly [underline]Krannish[/underline]. "[underline][unclear]Iballish[/unclear][/underline]" I find
means Italian [deletion]or French wine[/deletion] [insertion]probably from the Italian Carniole I suspect[/insertion]. I got some
[underline]"iron forte"[/underline], cast iron from Sava to ascertain
if it be not an alloy of Silicum. All
the mountains here Calcareous.
