a trout immediately, but a thunder storm
came on with hailstones as big as nutmegs

probably have caught a very large trout in
this magnificent river: I saw one rise of
at least 4[superscript]lbs[/superscript] last night; but such a storm
I never saw before; the lightning was
incessant, and it rained, hailed, then thundered
for at leat 3 hours.
