fine effect. No salmon rise above this fall,
which in point of quantity of water; I think
surpasses that of the Rhine at Shaffhausen
but is inferior to it in perpendicularity and
in picturesque accompaniments. I've returned
to dinner at Mr Marks, where we again found
kipper salmon, anchovies, brown bread and
butter and various liqueurs. This was the
prelude to the dinner. Our first course
was ham and, peas boiled with sugar in
their shells, then cutlets of veal very barely
fried: then some salmon (which I myself

abundance of parsley in their bellies. Then
roast veal; and last of all cranberry jelly
most delicious, with cakes and sweet things
We had plenty of fruit upon the table
before dinner which served as the garnish
