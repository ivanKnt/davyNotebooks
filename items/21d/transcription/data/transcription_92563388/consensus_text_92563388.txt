being very good, particularly the cucumbers
which had been prepared by being kept
sometime in salt, and then washed, which

[underline][unclear]four[/unclear] fowls[/underline] with plenty of parsley in their
bellies. Place sliced cucumbers, if you wish
X them to be wholesome in [underline]salt[/underline]. Another:

and the last toast we went to coffee, and
then home, though the hospitable master
of the house offered us supper and [underline][unclear]Bishop[/unclear][/underline]
probably wine and water, hot. -
We left Christiansand [insertion]in the[/insertion] this morning at 12
and at 4, found ourselves safely moored
