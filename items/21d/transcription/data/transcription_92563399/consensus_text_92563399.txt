scenery ruder. The stream rather whitish
but not muddy, flowed rapidly by the
rooks; yet we moved more rapidly against
it, and soon anchored before hedenefel
The fall of the Glommen being only 6
English miles off I ordered [insertion]requested[/insertion] the Captain
to sail up [insertion]ascend[/insertion] the stream to it, and we had
a most brilliant evening, dashing through
the rapids of this immense riva which I
think exceeds in size the Danube at Vienna
The banks were beautiful, but not wild,
cornfields, wooded hills, and some rocky
cliffs. He anchored at the termination
of the rapid in a rush of whirlpool,
close to the shore, and passed the night
on board. It was amusing to see the
wonder of the people who came out to
see this new phenomena of the steam
boat going against wind and tide, and
who from their exclamations, probably
took us for Lapland wizards.
