A person who asked us to take him up
the river invited us to his fathers house, close
to the fall; and in the morning the elder
brother and our friend came down to take us
up in two carriages. We were soon at the
fall, which is a grand [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]rush[/insertion] of water not
perpendicular, but in its descent, does not
make less than 100 feet of white water.
It is the grandest rush of water I ever saw
and after the descent, boils and foams for a
half a mile: Salmon never rise above it.
Boats have been sometimes carried down and
dashed with their burdens into pieces. From
the top of the fall where the river is perfectly
still, beautifully smooth, and a quarter of a
mile at least in breadth, it is a grand
sight to see this enormous mass suddenly
converted into foam and white wave, dashing
with an invisible shock and a noise like
thunder over immense masses of granite,
Saw mills are here likewise, but less offensive
