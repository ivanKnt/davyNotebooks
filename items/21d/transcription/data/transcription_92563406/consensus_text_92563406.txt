yet experienced. The inn at Stronstast
was dirty, the beds bad, the fare worse.
Rye bread and bad butter; the only thing
tolerable, a cutlet apparently made of
[underline]minced raw meat[/underline]. This is a good hint
for tenderness, as it does away one of the
great evils of fresh killing. [deletion]It would be[/deletion]
[deletion]a good plan to adopt in Scotland; but[/deletion]
[deletion]then it would be necessary to have a proper[/deletion]
chopper and to carry a clean board.
Stromstadt is a small town on granite
rocks, with a variety of coast, and its lands
of the same character. A lake containing
pike and coarse fish is emptied by a
small river which runs through the town,
We got into a boat and fished for pike
with flies, Lord Clifton took a small one,
On landing from the lake upon a small
promontory we found abundance of berries
in the English state of perfection: cranberries
blueberries, raspberries, and unknown black
juicy berry - [deletion](a vaccinum?) strawberries, 
or juniper[/deletion]
