and I tried my best flies and my best skill.
The inn was very bad; the master and mistress
the governess and the children, feasting and
out playing cards. It was on a Sunday that
I arrived: I could get nothing except what I
brought and what my servant collected in the
garden, and I was made sick even by this
fare. I got up very early on Monday and
examined the opposite side of the fall and went
down to the locks, a fine work of art, when
the navigation is carried on between Gottenburgh
and the Wenersee. The locks are deep in
the gneis and granite, altogether 120 feet
in depth, and giving many fine falls and
effects of water where they are to be filled
from the clean and beautiful stream of the
Gotha. The first natural fall seen from
that opposite, is very fine. There is as island
covered with wood in the middle which has
much of the saw mills. The salmon never
rise above the falls, and there are very few of
them: I am convinced they can never abound
