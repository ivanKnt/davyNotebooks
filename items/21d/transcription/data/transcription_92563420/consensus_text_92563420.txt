I found an old Snipe, with a young one,
the common snipe; and I think it very likely
they have been deceived in taking the young
common snipe, which is larger and fatter
than the old one, for a young double snipe:
Yet the sportsman who spoke to me at
Undevilla said he had seen some young
double snipes, and he seemed to me to know
the habits these birds well. He likewise
described the breeding habits of the woodcock
and stated that they were not uncommon
in the summer in the great woods of Sweden
I went out the next day shooting to endeavour
to ascertain more about the Finmark Snipe;
but found no double snipes, and killed only
a duck and a snipe, and could find no
Finmark snipes. This day saw the
Crown Prince of Sweden and his Princess, He
received me amiably, and talked upon a great
many subjects, and generally well; seemed to
understand something of chemical science
