better sport and which I saw only in going
away. At La Holme, I saw a very fine
river and was half inclined to stop; but
the wretchedness of the inn prevented me.
I saw a man fishing with a very large
bundle of [underline]lob worms[/underline], with which they
catch salmon; but they seem to know
nothing of the fly. My guide at Falken
-burg fished and caught one grilse with
a worm. Neither at Falconburgh, nor
at La Holme, are there any saw mills;
and hence probably the salmon are found
in plenty. They have precisely the character
of second rate scotch rivers, and are not
so hardly fished; but I doubt whether the
Swedish fishery even in their rivers, can
be reckoned superior to the Scotch. A
gentleman had been there 3 weeks ago
and fished without catching a salmon,
and I believe I raised most of the salmon
that day in the pools that I tried.
