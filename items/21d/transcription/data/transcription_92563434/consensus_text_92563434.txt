in returning. We returned at ten O. C.
in a calm and beautiful evening, I
saw two large stones surrounded by an
iron paling. Klopstock; and [person_893]his first
wife;[/person_893] and [person_892]his second wife[/person_892]; tomb, on the
side beyond the church yard was an
illuminated gate, and we asked why
it was so illuminated. At first I
 thought it was an honour paid to the
grave, and the memory of one of the
greatest poets Germany has produced.
 It turned out to be a place, a
[unclear]Parish hall[/unclear], into which we entered, and
saw W + R. not one whom had
perhaps ever heard of Klopstock; such
is glory and greatness; such the illustrious
dead. The Poet of the Messiah has however
a name for this generation, and we know
his birth place and where his bones lie.
This day went in search of the double
snipe, and did not find one; but
Count Blucher, the Governor of Altona
