us an excellent dinner, and is a most
amiable and enlightened Philosopher; I
spent a very pleasant day. He introduced
me to a sportsman who asserted in the most
decided manner that the double snipe bred
in Hanover and promised to send me young
 ones. He says the males assemble in the
month of May and make a great noise
and that they breed in the great marshes,
I saw one in the museum with the egg,
which seems to confirm his account.
I find such difficulties made with respect
to the Chase here, that I gave up the idea
and on Friday came down to Bracken
along and on the water which has nothing
picturesque; and this morning 14[superscript]th[/superscript] I am
on the Sea off Vanderogg. I am rejoiced
that I made the excursion to Altona
and Bremen; if has given me a better
idea of human nature, for Schumacher
Olbers and Gauss, appear to me no less
