Notes made in a Journey through
the Tyrol in 1814-15.
The spirit of prediction belonging to
great minds, like the mountains, which
being highest first receives the rays of the
sun.
Those persons who have most reputation,
who are highest, like mountains are cold;
except that one meets, here and there, with
a Madame de Stael, a volcanoe.
