 Oct 5. Left the inn where the people were
uncivil; the bill was 10 fl 30k, which
I objected to, but paid 10 and gave the
servants, who were in fact the innkeepers,
nothing. Passed on a few miles to the
Austrian frontier where the pass was
examined and permission given to go on
 to Insbruck. The road to the first
part was through desolate vallies, bounded
by high mountains, the Isen much
diminished at our feet; all the mountains
calcaceous. Some birch, but the pine the
 common wood. Stopped on the side of
a hill at the post to change horses: the
scenery continued similar, and in going
up and down mountains we at last
gained a view of the valley of the Isen,
a large river winding through a ravine
green and clothed with pine above high
