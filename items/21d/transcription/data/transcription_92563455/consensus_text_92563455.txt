the bed of the river and the mountains;
some pasture in this plain, and a great

postilion, who shewed me his horse; knees
broken and kept a chain round the wheel
which had no drag.
The valley of Insbruck disappointed me
the indian corn which every where sports
it gives it a parched character; probably
in the spring and summer it would
 be more beautiful. The mountains dark
in pines and above the black rock
with little ribbands or patches of snow.
The Isen a river as large as the Spey or
larger; bluish, and floating down immense
 quantities of wood. Insbruck rather a
good town; some of the houses in the
Italian style, and a fine bronze monument
