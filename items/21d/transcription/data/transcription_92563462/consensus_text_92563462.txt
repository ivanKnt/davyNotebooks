clothed hills rich in the varied vegetation
of birch, oak, wild grape, thorn, clematis
&[superscript]c[/superscript]. A small lake and then a larger
 one beautifully wooded, sending a
stream very small down to form the
Brenta. All limestone below this lake
and a succession of valleys which recalled
to my mind the Derbyshire glens
upon a larger scale, but vines in their
bosoms, always parasitical.
As we approached to Bassano, the
Brenta becomes a large stream, most
clear and of a very pale bluish green
colour, It descends through a limestone
chasm, onto the plain of the Vicensese
territory. All the limestone stratified
in this part of the Tyrol, and abundance
of arches and caves in it.
