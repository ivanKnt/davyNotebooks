The plain between Bassano and Vicenza
not interesting, but at Vicenza a
magnificent view of the
mountains and the Alps, and all the riches
of Pomona and Bacchus in the plain.
Palladian palaces in the city, and the hill
from which we had our view. Basalt
 rising out of the limestone. Mem: to
examine this tomorrow.
March 30. 1815. I have again passed
thorough the Tyrol as far as Bolzin, 
where we arrived at half past 3 O.C.
this day. We quitted Verona yesterday
morning and came on to Trente by the
Roverido road. The mountains all
limestone; and about a mile from Roverido
a scene of savage wildness and desolation
