The works of scientific men are like
the atoms of gold, of sapphire and of
diamonds, that exist in the great mountains.
 They form no perceptible part of the
mass of the mountain; they are neglected
and unknown when it is entire; they
are covered by vegetable mould; or by
forests: but when time has sapped its
foundation; when [insertion]its fragments[/insertion] [deletion]ruins[/deletion] are scattered
abroad by the elements, and its decayed
materials carried down by rivers, then
they glitter and are found: then their
immortality is known and they are
employed to ornament the diadems of
Emperors and the Sceptres of Kings: they
press under them the brows of majesty.
They lie too deep to be readily found.
