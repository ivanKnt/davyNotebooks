the thunder storm and the whirlwind;
but the dew, the rain and the sunshine
that fertilize the earth.
God governs man by the simplest
and most benevolent means: Hope &
fear. The powers and affections of
life cling even to the rudest and most
turbulent characters, and the deeper we
examine, the more they are found. Thus
though the surface of the rock in the
stormy sea, or most rapid torrent
is bare; yet below the surface it is
covered with vegetation, fed by the
raging and foaming waters.
