I have seldom seen a more curious
sight than the fisherman and boys of
the Galway river. They adventure for
a white trout, upon rocks in the midst
of a falling river, having the character
of a cataract; and are seen upon
rocks up to the middle in water in
places which would seem almost
inaccessible.
Beware of too much prosperity and
popularity. Life is made up of mixed
passages, dark, bright,[insertion]sunshine[/insertion] and gloom.
In the exercise of intellectual power, there
is a high degree of enjoyment, which has
compensated for the neglect, persecution, and
imprisonment of the greatest men. Gallileo,
