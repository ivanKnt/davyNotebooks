of futurity are bright in sunshine
and others dark in gloom.
The hopes that we have with respect
to another state of existence may
be compared to the objections that
we see in the sky when we ourselves
are in gloom, from a distant sunny
country: we are conscious that there
is a lighted surface in sunshine,
though we are totally ignorant of the
source of it.
Our histories of past events are something
 like the wrecks upon the sea beach: things
are often thrown up because they happen
to be light, or because they have been
entangled in sea weed: i.e. facts
are preserved which suit the temper
or party of a particular historian.
