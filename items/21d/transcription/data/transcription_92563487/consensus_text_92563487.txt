It appears to me that there are three
kinds of pursuits to which a powerful
mind to which a powerful mind may

the [underline]differential calculus[/underline] to the refined
movements of the corpuscular or atomic
arrangements. Or, perhaps a new calculus
may be invented bearing the same relations
to the smallest possible powers or functions
of atoms that the differential calculus
bears to masses, and assignable quantities
both of time and motion.
