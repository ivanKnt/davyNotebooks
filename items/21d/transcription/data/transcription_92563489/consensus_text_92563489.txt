analogies will fail us from gross matter
applied to light.
Is there not a monad, or one perceptive
atom or principle which plays as it were
round different arrangements in the brain
and which acts in its own little world
as the great diffusive monad does in the
universe; but how far beyond our power
the conception, how we are lost, and the
infinitely little of man and his thoughts
becomes most evident.
If we wish to act upon heavy matter
we must use heavy matter; and yet the
greatest power is in the [underline]lightest element[/underline]
