special revelations are no longer necessary
It is quite certain, that in these revelations,
no new ideas were given, and no new
impressions received, even the supposed
presence of Deity was an imagination
of a human form, and the miracles
mere delusions of the human mind,
though clearly disposed to these delusions
by the existence of the instinct, and
this indeed is in accordance with
the Divine wisdom and power, as it
is much more easy for mind to produce
an ideal conviction of satisfied appetite
than to create a new quantity of matter,
which must have been the case if
sufficient to satisfy the multitude
in the wilderness had been produced
from the small loaves and fishes.
