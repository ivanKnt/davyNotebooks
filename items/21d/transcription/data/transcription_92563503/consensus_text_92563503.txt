would have warned government
against the importation of corn,
which is now weighing down the
country by a diminished circulation
&c: A tax upon foreign corn would
have been preferred, not a maximum.
There would have been no notes and
no bankruptcies.
Any philosopher would have taught
government the uselessness of the present
coinage, and would have advised them
instead of buying bullion, by switching
paper to have taken 6 millions of paper
from the bank, as a proper bonus
for the immense sums levied by that
body upon the public. If coin
was wanting, they should have
obliged the bank to furnish it.
