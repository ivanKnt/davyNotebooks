but the foreign fund holders are very
few, the debt then is principally due
 for the labour of the British. England
 does not produce gold and silver:
therefore, the productive labour which
raised 500 millions must have been
enormous. The national debt called
forth all the energies of ingenuity &
 industry. The gold we sent abroad
was purchased by labour, and we
sent abroad an immense quantity
of produce, not of Corn or wine, but of
, hard ware, pottery, the produce
of our   our clays, our ores, and our
wool
I am sure there is gross ignorance
on every thing respecting the great
question.
