French Revolution.
They did not like the English patriots
kindle a sacred flame of liberty, by the
light of which they read their ancient
law; but they kindled a devouring
flame of anarchy, calling it a fire of
liberty, and fed it with all that was
sacred in their religion and their law;
and after having burnt the records of
their faith, they frantically danced round
it like a nation of savages, whilst the
bleached and parched bones of victims
seemed to shew that a nation of
cannibles had been celebrating a
feast to Moloch.
