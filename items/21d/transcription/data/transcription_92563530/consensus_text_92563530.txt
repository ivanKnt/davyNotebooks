149
In minds of great power, there is
usually a disposition to variety of
pursuits; and they often attempt all
branches of letters and science, and
even the imitative arts; but if they
become truly eminent, it is by devotion
to one object at a time, or at most
two objects. This sort of general power
is like a profusion of blossoms on a
fruit tree, a symptom of health and
strength; but if all are suffered to
become fruit, all are feeble and bad:
but when the greater portion is destroyed
by accident or act, the remainder, being
properly nourished; become good, large
and healthy. -
