that the greatest and highest intelligence
the results of the accumulated genius of
man operating through a long course
of ages, and at length attaining some-
-thing like perfection, should disappear
and all the results be lost. Surely
these results much attach to some
other system, which belongs to a moral
or intellectual scheme of things wholly
different from the physical, and which
coincides with the views belonging to
Revelation.
Or is even the highest perfection, and
aggregated power of the human mind
a mere nothing, compared with the
immensity of intellectual combinations
belonging to the universal mind, a
mere image in a dream, in relation
to the whole of the living and acting
universe
