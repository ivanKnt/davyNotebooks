them, and unmingled with them;
it gives form to their waves, but does
not change their substance. So, inspiration
can be made known to men only through
terms connected with common life, and
popular ideas, and revelation must be
an impulse of thought, or a peculiar
association of ideas, and not a new
creation of thought.
Even in the Roman and Greek Mythology
there seem to have been some vestiges
or remains of this instinct.
Prophecy or inspiration limited to
particular purposes, not giving omniscience
and necessarily blended with the false
knowledge of the mind.
Glimmerings of Diving light seem often
to belong to the weakest intellects, and
to have been exhibited in recent times.
