oyster compared with each other; yet
there is [deletion]more[/deletion] [insertion]none[/insertion] when either of them is
compared with infinite wisdom. The
destruction of a world, and the crushing
of a gnat are alike insignificant when
considered with respect to infinity: and
to make infinite wisdom and goodness after
our models, is absurd; [deletion]as much[/deletion] more so
than to expect a preaching ant, or a writing
bee.
We must believe that whatever has been
once sentient, will be for ever sentient,
 and has been for ever sentient but the
human intellect is by divine wisdom
made acquainted with the past, only as
 it may be [deletion]made[/deletion] [insertion]useful[/insertion] to guide [insertion]to[/insertion] the future:
but I have some idea, that conscience
is a habit of mind, resulting from a
previous state of existence.
