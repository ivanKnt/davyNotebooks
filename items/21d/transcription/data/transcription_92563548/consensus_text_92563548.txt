of the land rail are in fact miraculous
when the short habitual flight of these

Man is not intended to pry into
futurity; and the occasional miracles
and gleams of prophecy seem intended
to demonstrate Divine interference or

No Mortal eye has seen any thing
like creation; and no mortal being
has received divine honours and lived
long.

Nothing so fatal as excess of power
