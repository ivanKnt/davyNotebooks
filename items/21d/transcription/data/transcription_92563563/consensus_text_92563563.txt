greatness save when they are seen
through the telescope of time: yet
they are everlasting & are viewed from
all parts of the earth & by all people.
Science unlike literature is independent
of taste or caprice.
Whover wishes to enjoy [underline]peace[/underline] & is
gifted with great talents must labor
for posterity. In doing this he
enjoys all the pleasures of intellectual
labour & all the desire arising from
procrasted hope: He feels no envy nor
jealousy: his mark is too far distant
to be seen by short sighted malevolence
& therefore it is never aimed at.
