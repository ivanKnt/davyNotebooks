Rome Nov. 4, 1819
[Horizontal rule]
I was in the Coliseum this year,
the summer seemed to pass into
the Autumn & the Zephyr blew as
mildly as in June. One moonlight
night I was walking in the Coliseum
fall of sublime thoughts, lamenting the
loss of the Greek & Roman superstition
& contrasting it with the Beadsmans
worship in the midst of this sublime
pile of ruins - when on a sudden I
saw a light mist in one of the meades
so luminous that I thought a person
must be advancing with a light.
I approached towards it, when suddenly
it enveloped me, an aromatic smell
like that of fresh orange flowers seemed
