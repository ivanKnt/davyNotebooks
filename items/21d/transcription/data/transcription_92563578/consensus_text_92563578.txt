imagined myself in a place partially
illuminated with a hazy reddish
light, Within it was dark & obscure
but without & opening upon the sky
very bright, I experienced a new kind
of sensation which it is impossible to
describe; it seemed as if I became
diffused in the atmosphere & had a
general sense of a balmy warmth: -
a sort of agreeable with my whole
body. Floating for a little while in this
atmosphere, I found that I had wings
& slowly & with some difficulty I rose
in the air & gradually ascending above
the cave or recess in which was the
red light, I found myself in the [deletion]clouds[/deletion]
sky amidst bright clouds or galaxies
of light. It seemed as if I was altogether
entering into a new state of existence
