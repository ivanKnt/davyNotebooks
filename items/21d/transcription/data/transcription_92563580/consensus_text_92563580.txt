I for some time reposed upon the
brightest of these galaxies & saw as
it were in the immensity of space
systems of suns & worlds forming a
sort of abyss of light into which
I seemed doubtful whether I should
plunge. At this moment I seemed
in communication with some intelligent
 being to     I stated that I had
always been of opinion that the spirit
was eternal & in a state of progression
from one form of existence to another
more perfect, that I had just left
a world where all was dark & cold
& gross & heavy; that I now knew
what it was to have a purer & better
existence, but that I hoped for something
still more perfect; that I was now
in natural warmth & light & ether
