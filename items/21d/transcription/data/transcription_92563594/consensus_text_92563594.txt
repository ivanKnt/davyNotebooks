where all was dark &
cold & gross & heavy; -
that I now know what
it was to have a power
& better existence, - but
that I hoped for something
still more powerful; - that
I was now in natural
warmth & light & ether, -
& that I hoped to be
ultimately in a world
of intellectual light
where the causes of all
things would be developed
& where the sources of
pleasure would be
unbounded knowledge.
after this my dream
