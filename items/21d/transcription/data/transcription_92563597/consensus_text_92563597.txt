is impossible to describe;
it seemed as if I became
diffused in the atmosphere
& had a general sense
of a balmy warmth,
Floating a little while
 in this atmosphere. I
found that I had wings, -
slowly and with some difficulty
I rose in the air &
gradually ascending above
the cave or recess in which
was the red light, I found
myself in the sky amidst
high clouds or galaxies
of light: if seemed as
if I was altogether entering 
a new state of existence
I for some time reposed
