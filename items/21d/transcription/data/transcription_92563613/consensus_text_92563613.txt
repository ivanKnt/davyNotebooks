203
Which summer steals from spring
Wafting each visitant odours new.
Where faintly gleamed the evening star
The temples Paestum from afar
Arraigned their marble columns bright
In the last gleams of purple light
Above the wild deserted plain
Where death & silence seemed to reign
Temples whose massy form & finished grace
Speak of the Genius of a Grecian race. -
