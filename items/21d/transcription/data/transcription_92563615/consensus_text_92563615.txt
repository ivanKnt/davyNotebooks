Then from the Caraba her thrilling song
Her minstrel music [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] wild & strong
And gentle Doves in thicket nigh
Heard scarcely audible their sigh.
Life seemed in every thing to be
The blades of maize, the leaves of tree
The cones that shook on the giant pine
Seemed moved by an impulse of power
divine
Joy seemed to dance in every thing,
The blast was from a Zephyr's wing
Moistened by that balmy dew
