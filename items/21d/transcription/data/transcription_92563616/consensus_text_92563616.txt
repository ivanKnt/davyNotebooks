205
The mountains above were clear & bright
Empurpled by the evening light 
Not a single cloud was was seen in the sky
But the wind was turbulent & high
And full it blew on the Tyrrhene sea
Which rose in billowy majesty
Which rose but not in its' stormy hue
For its' colour was brightest purest blue
Save where it foamed in crested pride
White as the snow on the glaciers wide.
Though loud the wind & high the breeze
Murmuring amidst the odorous trees
Yet Philomel as if to prove
More loud as well as sweet the voice of love
& entitled. -
