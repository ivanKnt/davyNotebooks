who is carried first down
the stream of earthly time
where the changes of different
empires, races & creeds
appear upon a great
scale, all of the same
kind & all for the end
of improvement of man
was when man seems
 little more an improver
than the Bee or the Ant
obeying the same invariable
& eternal instincts, yet
the absolute progress is
sure - Wars, Loves, popular
associations are all of
same kind, but all tending
to improvement, & the only
difference between a field
