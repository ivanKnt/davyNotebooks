I could no longer bear the scorching
rays;
and, when I looked again they were
not seen
Lost in the [deletion][unclear]bxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] brightness of the
solar blaze
Their memory left a type & a desire
So should I wish towards the
light to rise,
Instructing younger spirits to
aspire
Where I could never reach amidst
the skies
And joy below to see them lifted
higher
Seeking the light of purest glory's
prize
So would I look on splendour's
brightest day
With an undazzled eye, & steadily
Soar upwards full in the im-
mortal ray
Through the blue depths of the
unbounded sky
