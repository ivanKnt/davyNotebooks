247
of my dying suddenly, I think
it right to mention that
I am too intense a believer
in the supreme intelligence
& have too strong a faith
in the optimism of the
system of the universe even
to accelerate my disposition:
the Laurel water therefore which
I have carried about with
me & used constantly &
from which I think I have
decidedly derived benefit
is a prescription of
Tomasinis' & the Laudanum
& opium which are in
my dressing case, but
which [underline]I have never used[/underline]
