[place]place_1004|Filigare[/place], June 23
Journal 1819.
I have resolved to keep a journal of the
journey I am about to make. I have felt
that through life I have lost many thoughts
that were worth preserving, not only for my
own amusement, but for the amusement of others
I believe I have often made observations and
combinations that were new, at least I never met
with them in books, and the present state of
society and of knowledge is different from
any that ever existed. Man has made a
wonderful progress in physical knowledge:
there are many profound thinkers in every thing
belonging to the progress of political improve-
-ment; but the governors of the world are children
compared with their servants. The useful acts
have made a much greater progress than at
any former period; and the imaginations of
men subdued by the sense of utility, no
longer kindles into poetry, or freezes in
profound metaphysics. A few scintillations
shine in the gloom; but the public consider

[page]6|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00006|dnp21d002pp|92563308[/page]
them as dangerous, and not as likely to
kindle into a permanent and useful [deletion]system[/deletion] [insertion]fire[/insertion],
but rather as leading to a dangerous conflagration
and the persons who possess them as incendiaries
A. person viewing nature and society without
prejudice may at this moment amuse himself
and perhaps instruct others. I left the [place]place_952|baths[line]of Lucca[/place] [insertion]in[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] a [nonenglish]nonenglish_296|Caratella[/nonenglish] and two horses,
my two dogs and [person]person_832|James[/person], yesterday, and
travelled to [place]place_1080|Florence[/place] where I slept. I
thought the [underline]the vile Fans[/underline] might be
changed with propriety to [nonenglish]nonenglish_345|[unclear]"Nil vilise Fanc"[/unclear][/nonenglish]
but [insertion]I was piqued[/insertion] [deletion]perhaps my pique was illegitimate[/deletion]
I left [place]place_1080|Florence[/place] convinced, that some of the
squabbles of the English with the Italian postilions
are owing to their own ignorance and rashness
I generally find them very quick and courteous
and manageable. The Tariffe does not allow
an extra horse; but I find there is a written
law for it. I left [place]place_1080|Florence[/place] at 10. and
got here at a quarter before 6. making the
first post in 2 hours, the second in an hour
and a half, the third in one hour and thirty

[page]7|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00007|dnp21d003pp|92563309[/page]

five minutes, the fourth in an hour and
forty minutes and the fifth in an hour. I
saw a man carrying some meat in the
sun at the first post; it was so hot and
there were so many flies upon it, that it
stood a chance of not only being roasted,
but eaten, before he got to the next village
The hills of the [place]place_1150|Apennines[/place] are not beautiful
till the third post; then they become green,
and the quantity of oak and birch give great
beauty to them, and they abound in meadows
Near my old haunt [place]place_694|[underline]Pietra mala[/underline][/place] the
[place]place_530|Appenine[/place] consists of a most singular rock
a sort of [misc]misc_542|Pudding stone[/misc] containing much green
stone [deletion]and much[/deletion] & [chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical] The meadows are
exquisitely green. The temperature was only 62
at 8 in the evening and there was a strong
wind, probably from the descent of air from
the highest peaks of the mountains. Fire flies
were abundant, even on the top of the mountain
above. Lightning bright & beautiful
in a [underline]blue sky[/underline], the thunder clouds being below

[page]8|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00008|dnp21d004pp|92563311[/page]
on the side of the hill. Thermometer at
40 minutes past 9 still 62. 24. Thermom[superscript]r[/superscript]
at 5 a.m. at 57 mist & rain. At 8, 55.
On the journey at [place]place_942|Bologna[/place] 74. On the road
80. At [place]place_1005|Modena[/place] 76 at 4 p.m. At 7 p.m. 75
the 24th of June was [underline]throughout a sunny day[/underline]
after we passed the [place]place_530|Appenines[/place], clouds hung
upon them; from [place]place_1005|Modena[/place] at 6 they appeared
clear, the mountains to the S.W., which
must be above the [place]place_1332|Serchia[/place], with large
patches of snow upon them. Reached [place]place_1005|Modena[/place]
at 4 p.m. The corn all cut in the
neighbourhood of [place]place_942|Bologna[/place], and very little
standing round [place]place_1005|Modena[/place]. St John's day
very brilliant at [place]place_1005|Modena[/place]; the whole
population out. Bad inn, at the [deletion]the bad[/deletion] [underline]Post,[/underline]
but not bad Bordeaux. The evening beautiful
but as usual in towns, the thermometer
did not fall as might have been expected:
75. in my bed room at a quarter past 9.
The country about [place]place_1005|Modena[/place] extremely verdant
and rich, and the view of the Appenines very

[page]9|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00009|dnp21d005pp|92563314[/page]

brilliant; but little snow on the high peaks,
The highest mountain [insertion]after thereabout[/insertion] [deletion]No of[/deletion] [place]place_848|Velino[/place] and S.
of the [place]place_247|Alps[/place], must be one to the N. of the
[place]place_952|Baths of Lucca[/place]. I should think from the
time the snow rests it cannot be less than
6500, or 7000 feet high.
25[superscript]th[/superscript]. left [place]place_1005|Modena[/place] at 4[superscript]o[/superscript].C. a.m, the
thermometer 68[superscript]o[/superscript]. but rose to 74 before 7 O.C.
A very hot day, without a cloud; between
12 and 4 thermometer at from 88 to 78 in the
shade. Had accidents with the carriage, and
a detention of 5 or 6 hours, yet we got to
[place]place_622|Verona[/place] at half past 9. A beautiful
sunset, and the [place]place_247|Alps[/place] appearing in a great
glory & beauty. Infamous cheating and
[insertion]money[/insertion] [deletion]treatment[/deletion] in the [place]place_947|Mantuan vicinity[/place]. The
thermometer stands now [place]place_622|(at Verona)[/place] at quarter
past 11. night, at 77.5. I do not find the heat
at all disagreeable: One perspires a little.
The people at [place]place_1006|Roverbello[/place] complain dreadfully
as they did in 1815 when I passed them of the
events of the war; yet how fertile & glorious

[page]10|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00010|dnp21d006pp|92563316[/page]
is this country. The corn is now all cut,
and they may have a second crop, and
wherever the [place]place_1333|Minsio[/place] runs, the country is
emerald green, and the whole plain
between [place]place_942|Bologna[/place] and [place]place_622|Verona[/place] is a garden,
green from bright and high grass [insertion]or[/insertion] maize
[insertion]or rice or[/insertion] [deletion]and[/deletion] vines, and yellow from stubble and
a little standing corn. It would seem
that with industry and equal laws, this
country would swarm with men.
26[superscript]th[/superscript] Thermometer 86 on the road. The
thermometer fell 10 degrees on entering the
pass of the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place]. Temperature of the [place]place_426|Adige[/place] 66.
of a beautiful clear stream gushing out
of a rock in the road 55[superscript]o[/superscript]. I think the
temperature of the [place]place_426|Adige[/place] given, too low. I
shall try it tomorrow. The little stream
issuing out of the [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] at 55[superscript]o[/superscript]. was
about 4 or 5 miles from [place]place_948|[place]place_948|Ala[/place][/place], towards
[place]place_622|Verona[/place]; the temperature of the little river
that runs by [place]place_607|Roveredo[/place], through a wild
mountain pass was 56[superscript]o[/superscript]. The opening

[page]11|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00011|dnp21d007pp|92563319[/page]
7
of the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place] from [place]place_622|Verona[/place] was very grand:
the immense masses of [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical], however
fatigue the eye and there is not enough of
green to afford shade, and the day which
was excessively hot was not favourable to
this kind of scenery. After we left the
plain of [place]place_622|Verona[/place], the thermometer was
generally above 86, and sometimes 90. in
the shade: the effect of heat, when the whole
surface is exposed to the sun is amazingly
increased by radiation. On the banks of
the [place]place_426|Adige[/place] where the plain was considerable
the vegetation was very rich and had all
the brilliancy of that of [place]place_1268|Tuscany[/place]. This
valley resembles somewhat that of the Arno
the mountains of which have the same defects
as to scenery. Found a comfortable inn
and resolved to stay whilst my carriage
was repairing.
27[superscript]th[/superscript]. Went off this morning at 6 to the
top of the [place]place_551|Lago di Garda[/place], 2 posts, paid
[deletion]of[/deletion] 2 florins good money. The temperature at

[page]12|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00012|dnp21d008pp|92563320[/page]
[place]place_607|Roverido[/place] was 74 to 75 when we set out
After we had crossed the [place]place_426|Adige[/place] it fell
to 73 and there was a strong breeze
from the lake. At [place]place_607|Roverido[/place] 72. Passed
by the villa of a Count of Castro[deletion]barca[/deletion][insertion]barca[/insertion]
with a pretty lake surrounded by mountains
and sending a small tributary stream
to the [place]place_426|Adige[/place]. When we got on the hill
above the lake, [place]place_551|[underline]the lago di Garda[/underline][/place] broke
in upon us in great magnificence
of a bright sapphire tint; and this tint
contrasted with the red and dove colour
of the [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] cliffs of the mountain
above it, on which white clouds were
moving, gave great beauty and grandeur
to the scene. The river which was one
of my objects was turbid from the
melting of the snow, but I saw a number
of the trouts taken in it, from 40
to 3 pounds. They are evidently a trout
having habits which lead them to feed
in the lake, and then mount against

[page]13|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00013|dnp21d009pp|92563322[/page]

the stream to spawn. They are all fat
and silvery in their colour, and are I
think the best fish I ever tasted. The
common trout, which is brought down
from another river near [place]place_551|[place]place_551|Riva[/place][/place][deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion], and which
is exactly our river trout ill fed, they call
[underline][misc]misc_722|Carpione[/misc][/underline] The river trout of the Lago and of the
river which runs by Turbione are like
those of the [place]place_537|Colne[/place], and have hardly any
spots. The one I ate was 6 [superscript]lbs[/superscript] and was
pink, but I believe it had been injured in
the nets, for it was not nearly so red as one
I cut some years ago, which I believe was
about twice as large: but it was a most
excellent fish. I doubt not these fish might
be taken with the hook, and I regret that
I did not troll for them; but I went
prepared for flyfishing, and had no minnow
tackle for a fish of 10 pounds, and the water
wa not clear enough for flyfishing. In
the end of Sept[superscript]r[/superscript] and in Oct[superscript]r[/superscript] when the weather

becomes cold, and the river clear, the water
bailiff told me that they might be taken
with the fly, and this is the period of
their greatest migration [insertion]*[/insertion]: the temperature
of this water was only 60[superscript]o[/superscript]. Fah. that of
the air being 80[superscript]o[/superscript]. There is a tolerable inn
at [place]place_551|Riva[/place], as I was told at [deletion]Torbura[/deletion] [insertion][unclear]verbure[/unclear][/insertion], and
it must be a cool summer residence: the
thermometer was from 72[superscript]o[/superscript]. to 76[superscript]o[/superscript]. in the middle
of the day. It is now standing in the shade
at [place]place_607|Roverido[/place] at 81 1/2 at half past 5 p.m.
and I am drinking water at 64[superscript]o[/superscript] which appears
cold as ice. [deletion]In[/deletion] The general geological aspect
of the country in the neighbourhood of the
[place]place_551|Lago di Garda[/place] is like that of [place]place_192|Illyria[/place]: the
same great masses of [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] and a
similar stratification. The picturesque aspect
is not unlike, but here the olive and the
vine clothe the sides of the hills, and the
chesnut and the oak rise to the tops of the
mountains: and in [place]place_192|Illyria[/place], the beech and
the oak occupy the hills, and the pine is

the tree of the mountain. [place]place_551|Riva[/place] I think
would be a more agreable place [insertion]for summer[/insertion] than the
[place]place_952|Baths of Lucca[/place]; for there are [underline]trout[/underline], [underline][misc]misc_723|Coturnici[/misc][/underline]
[underline]Pernice[/underline] Galline, and the great [misc]misc_724|[underline]Coc. di Bois[/underline][/misc]
Is this a fable of hosts? - Yet [person]person_834|Dal armi[/person]
told me they were found near Trente.
28[superscript]th[/superscript] Left [place]place_607|Roverido[/place] at 4 O.C. and found
the bill extremely reasonable, and the inn,
{the White Horse, I believe) opposite the post, very
reasonable: paid but 23 francs for 2 days;
8 francs for the rooms and 1 franc for my
breakfast and 10 Sous for my Servant. Here
the german posting of 2 florins 2 [unclear]H[/unclear] a
post is established. It is better to change
[unclear]sequins[/unclear], as you get 5 florins 36 [unclear]K[/unclear]. Bavarian
for them, and they are good but [insertion]for[/insertion] 5.24 : in
posting money they bring 4.30, or 4 1/2 The state
posting is 5 lire and half, the pair of horses, and
25 the [unclear]stallure[/unclear]; and I always gave as much
or rather more than the price of a horse to the
post boy. The morning was much cooler; 70.

28[underline][superscript]th[/superscript][/underline]
Passed rapidly through Trente: saw [person]person_834|Dal Arne[/person],
who told me that the [nonenglish]nonenglish_201|Pitzardone[/nonenglish] was found
in the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place], probably in the marshes above
Trente in the end of July and the beginning of
August. Clouds began to gather upon the
mountains, and rain effectually cooled the
air, and prevented my newly repaired wheels
from taking fire. Got to [place]place_333|Bolsano[/place], and slept
at the [underline]Kaiser Crown[/underline], a tolerable inn: charges
reasonable: A thunder storm kept me within
doors. This is called an Italian city, but
its population is German; not one person out
of ten speaks Italian.
29th left [place]place_333|Bolsano[/place] at seven; a beautiful
morning: saw the clouds which remained,
the remnants of the storm, rising up the
snowy crags and cliffs and pine covered sides
of the stern mountain. Passed several
currents with some little difficulty: found
the scenery [place]place_336|[insertion]near Brixen[/insertion][/place] inferior to that close to [place]place_333|Bolsano[/place];
but on leaving [place]place_336|Brixan[/place] and taking the [place]place_329|Carinthian[/place]
road it became very grand. This branch of

the [deletion]Ey[/deletion][place]place_330|Eisach[/place] foamed over rocks amongst green
meadows and vineyards and a few chesnuts
and walnuts appear in the green fields, and
the dark pine is above. Slept at a genuine
[place]place_328|Tyrolese Inn[/place]: civility, cleanliness, and all the
comforts of the best English country inn; all
the attendance by women. The postmaster,
the innkeeper, and, how I know not in a country
so little travelled through, every thing seemed to
be in order. I suspect the country people
make great use of these inns, for I saw
numerous parties eating and drinking.
30[superscript]th[/superscript] Sept. [deletion]Left [insertion]ber:[/insertion] Wintel at 7. A reasonable bill[/deletion]
[deletion]of 4f. 24.[/deletion] Slept at [place]place_280|Silliare[/place] after a very
pleasant days journey: ascended through meadows
meadows to the spot where the waters part, and
saw to the east, the source of the [place]place_260|Drave[/place], a
beautiful limpid stream; and to the west, that
of the [deletion]Ey[/deletion][place]place_330|Eisach[/place]. Above [place]place_327|Brunneken[/place], the mountains
are very grand and bold, and immense masses
of snow covering them to their apparent bases

[page]18|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00018|dnp21d014pp|92563329[/page]
So that they looked like the Savoy [place]place_247|Alps[/place]
in Winter: the temperature of the air from
48 to 60; that of the Gisach where it is a
small stream of 52. Below [place]place_327|Brunneken[/place], a
magnificent chain of mountains is seen to
the South, or the Italian side, and accompanied
my view all the way to [place]place_280|Sillian[/place], which
is on the banks of the [place]place_260|Drave[/place], a Stream here
containing no [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc], but trout and [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc].
These mountains appear of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], and excessively
bold and precipitous, very like the needles in
the valley of Chamouni and bearing almost
the same relations to snow which lay in
immense masses even at their juncture with
the pine covered hills.
July 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. A very fine day. In the morning
the thermometer at half past 6, at 55[superscript]o[/superscript]: it
rose towards 2 O.C., as high as 65. Fished
in the [place]place_260|Drave[/place], and the Stream that joins
it below [place]place_280|Sillian[/place], and caught 14 or 16 trout
and [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc]: observed that the fish lay
more in the still pools near the great

[page]19|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00019|dnp21d015pp|92563330[/page]
15
river, and in the divisions of the river, in
water meadows where they are not so liable
to be carried off by the rapid torrent.
The [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc] does not rise so high as this: the
[misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] were larger than the trout, one near
a pound. My host's son, who spoke Italian
and a little French, did the honours of the
house with infinite civility; and the people in
general, seem an excellent race, not interested,
courteous in manner and independent in
character.
July 2[superscript]d[/superscript]. It rained in the beginning of
the night. Thermometer at my window this
morning at 7, at 56; and it rose to 60 in
the Sun. Left [place]place_280|Sillian[/place]; my bill amounted
for the two days to 10 florins, add including
a bottle of Wurtzburg wine, two florins. The
valley of the [place]place_260|Drave[/place] became warmer as we
approached [place]place_1045|Lientz[/place]; the river was turbid from
the rain of last night, and in summer I
was informed is rarely clear; either the heat

[page]20|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00020|dnp21d016pp|92563332[/page]
melts the snow which occasions a flood or
the clouds bring rain. The town of [place]place_1045|Lientz[/place]
is near the confluence of the [place]place_260|Drave[/place] with
the [place]place_1046|Isel[/place]; and the [place]place_1046|Isel[/place] is much the largest
river of the two. It was more transparent than
the [place]place_260|Drave[/place], but had that blue milkiness
which I have always found indicating a
snowy origin. The little plain of [place]place_1045|Lientz[/place]
surrounded by hills and mountains is
extremely rich; and its temperature so much
higher than that of the valley above, that
Indian corn ripens, and some rye was
already cut. The day was cloudy and
showery, yet the thermometer stood at
64[superscript]o[/superscript]; the temperature of the [place]place_1046|Isel[/place] 54.
The prospect of bad weather induced me
to give up the idea of going to [place]place_1334|Heligo [unclear]blut[/unclear][/place]
and to [insertion]the[/insertion] [place]place_1047|Glocknee[/place]; and I was informed that
this was not the season for the [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc],
that they are found or caught only in spring
and autumn. I saw none, and went to
[place]place_1049|OverDranb[deletion]ry[/deletion][insertion]erg[/insertion][/place] where I saw some large

[page]21|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00021|dnp21d017pp|92563333[/page]
17
[misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc], in a little stream of beautiful
clearness tributary to the [place]place_260|Drave[/place]. The inn
did not tempt me, nor the offer of shewing
me some hares to shoot, made by the Innkeeper
and I went through the same kind of scenery
to [place]place_1050|Greiffenburg[/place], where I found a good inn
and had a [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc] of about 2lbs and a half for
dinner. It is like an ill fed trout, but
has no spots; is much longer, and perfectly
silvery. Its skin remarkably thick, its taste
hardly different from that of the trout: it
did not [misc]misc_725|calver[/misc] much, but probably it was 24
hours old. The [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc] that I eat at [place]place_555|Gratz[/place]
last year [misc]misc_725|calvered[/misc] like Salmon. I walked
by the side of a beautiful stream that rose
up through a glen covered with pines and
fell over rocks, making some fine cascades.
The valley here is well cultivated, extremely
green and the haymaking going on. I tried
in vain for [misc]misc_307|Hucho[/misc]; but seeing a land rail
and hearing some quails, I brought down
the dogs, found the land rail and shot it

[page]22|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00022|dnp21d018pp|92563334[/page]
and shot two quails; but gave up the
sport, for they were too young.
4[superscript]th[/superscript]. Came on to [place]place_1051|Saxenburg[/place], where I
took a twelve o clock dinner, soup, sallad,
and veal cutlets, and Illyrian wine; expense
1.[insertion]f[/insertion]14. for myself and servant. Looked at
the [place]place_1052|Mohl[/place]: a clear stream with a little
snowy milkiness, as large as the [place]place_1335|[place]place_774|Ischel[/place][/place]; saw
no [misc]misc_307|Huchos[/misc]. The scenery up the valley of the
Mol [insertion]or [place]place_1052|Mohl[/place][/insertion] very fine, and bounded by snowy
mountains: Came on to [place]place_1053|Spital[/place] and walked
to the [place]place_598|Mulhstadler see[/place], from which a
beautiful clear stream joins the snow tinted
Lider and makes its blueness more transparent
the [place]place_598|Mulhstadler see[/place] beautifully clear and
commanding fine views of the snowy mountains
of the valley of the Lider. The scenery
about [place]place_1053|Spital[/place] combines much of beauty and
grandeur. Caught in a half hour in the
[place]place_1052|Mulhstad[superscript]r[/superscript] river[/place], 10 trout, some 3/4 [superscript]lb[/superscript]: they
did not cut red: Saw a number of small
perch in the river, German women Tyr,

Tyrolese catholics: lost my passport: Temp

Temperature in travelling from 80 to 86: in
the inn at [place]place_309|Villach[/place], a large room, about
73 or 74. In coming down upon [place]place_309|Villach[/place]
left the [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Schist[/chemical] chain of mountains
and had a fine view of the calcareous chain
of the [place]place_1057|Loikel[/place] with [place]place_1058|Mount Craie[/place] rising above
the rest, snow still remaining in the hollows
of its conical summit; and to the west of
it, the highest of this boundary chain on the
road to [place]place_1059|Tarvis[/place] rose in great majesty its
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] peaks covered with snow
Drove to the [place]place_1056|Osiacher see[/place], about three miles;
a piece of water of no great beauty, except
when it was brought in front of the great
mountain chain: a slow stream issued
from it full of coarse fish, but I saw no
trout: Barbel. Roach and Dace in abundance
The Tyrolese women, seem to have scarcely

[page]24|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00024|dnp21d020pp|92563338[/page]
any bosoms. I did not observe the goitre
much in the valley of the Upper [place]place_260|Drave[/place];
but here, and on entering the valley of the
[place]place_1052|Muhl[/place], it becomes so common, that every
second woman has it, at least those past
25. The [place]place_329|Carinthian[/place] women have less
bosom than either the English, French or
Italians; fine arms, which they expose and
fair hair, I once thought a part of the
Italian character, their indifference to human
life, depended upon their constant familiarity
with statues, images, and pictures, in which
death and wounds are represented: but in
the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place] [insertion]wooden images of[/insertion] [person]person_951|Christ[/person] and the two Thieves as
large as life, and with blood and wounds
in abundance [insertion]are constantly seen on the roads[/insertion] yet this people is freest of
all from the crime of assassination. I think
the exposure of the human body and
face as we see in [place]place_097|Italy[/place] at funerals
has a bad effect on the mind.

6[superscript]th[/superscript] Set out for [place]place_256|Wurtzen[/place] at half past 6,
the thermometer was already at 75, and it rose
to 80 and 82 on the road. Crossed the mountain
stream which divides [place]place_329|Carinthia[/place] from [place]place_181|Carniola[/place]
and saw the mountain [deletion]stream[/deletion] which furnishes
the molybdate of lead; an immense mass
of yellow and red [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]. The view in
coming into the valley of the [place]place_214|Save[/place] very fine
Immense mountains of [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical], precipitous and
rugged: pines reaching about two thirds up, and
immense masses of snow in the hollows. In coming
within the influence of the snow the thermometer
fell to 78. Found the inn tolerable and the
[place]place_214|Save[/place] a fine trout stream; so I staid to fish
and to examine the source of this beautiful
water: caught 8 trout one of them at least a
pound. Found the temperature at the bridge
60Â°. It rises about a quarter of a mile above
[place]place_256|Wurtzen[/place], and must have a temperature about
50 or 52, for I had no thermometer. It gushes

[page]26|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00026|dnp21d022pp|92563342[/page]
forth from a number of small holes, and
where it first rises may be leapt across, but
it soon enlarges and forms a beautiful clear
lake surrounded by rushes, and in which
there are wooden houses for shooting wild
ducks at the time of their passage. The
mountains round this place are very grand on
all sides. The road to [place]place_1059|Tarvis[/place], and so on to
[place]place_1060|Ponteba[/place] and [place]place_1061|Udino[/place], only a post and a half
off, so that it is easy to go from this place
to [place]place_1061|Udino[/place] in a day. The meadows very
green, the hay making: heard no Quails, but
some land rails, and my dog found one.
the wild ducks do not breed here, nor [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]
but they migrate here in the beginning of
August. The common language is Sclavonic
The whole chain of the [place]place_181|Carniola[/place] Mountains

7[superscript]th[/superscript] Temperature of the air on the road
from 78Ë to 91Ë, generally 91Ë in the little
close villages; and from 84Ë. to 86Ë. on the

two chains of mountains, those of [place]place_329|Carinthia[/place]
the [place]place_339|Loibel[/place]; and those of [place]place_181|Carniola[/place], having
Mount [place]place_343|Terglou[/place] for its highest point. That
branch of [place]place_214|the Sava[/place] which I followed down
is called the [place]place_344|Krainer Sava[/place]. The other
which has its origin in the Wolksheim
See, is called the Wolkein [place]place_214|Save[/place]. Went
out of the post road at Asling or [place]place_214|Sava[/place]
to go to [place]place_342|Ratmansdorff[/place]. This is one of
the most beautiful [insertion]drives[/insertion] I have seen. The
plain between the two chains of mountains
is elevated on the side where it meets
the [place]place_329|Carinthian Mountains[/place], above the

[page]28|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00028|dnp21d024pp|92563345[/page]
valley of the [place]place_214|Save[/place], and is rich in pasture
with clumps or hedge rows of trees, walnuts
ash, elms, chesnuts, limes, & beeches. It is
like an English Noblemans park, with an
intermixture of corn, clover & maize.
There is a fine cliff to the right, topped
by a picturesque castle, and one range
of broken hills, and from disti[insertion]n[/insertion]ct ranges
of mountains, the last the [unclear]xxx[/unclear] [insertion]bare[/insertion] and snowy

winds, and the meeting of the two waters
one bright blue, the other sea green, is
distinctly seen: the lowest hills have
the same vegetation as the plain, the
next range oak and beech; the third
pines, the fourth pines and bare rocks,
the fifth without any appearance of
vegetation, cliffs of marble, or masses of
snow. By the sides, or upon the bases
of the hills are seen beautiful villages
with white spires rising amidst the trees

I was received at the house of a shopkeeper

It abounds in fish, the best of which
are the [misc]misc_726|waller[/misc] [insertion]siluris glanis[/insertion] and carp. I bought a [misc]misc_726|waller[/misc]
of 2 [superscript][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/superscript] for a 20 K piece; it is a fish very
like a [misc]misc_725|Barbot[/misc], but grows to an immense
size; had no back fin, but a small
antenna instead, and has an immense
mouth. Temperature was from 80 to 90.[superscript]o[/superscript] on
the road and is now in the shade at my
open window 87[superscript]o[/superscript]. Returned by the
Wolkheim [place]place_214|Sava[/place] the views up the valley are
very beautiful. By shutting the window I
have reduced the temperature to 76 [superscript]o[/superscript]. I saw
yesterday the may fly, green and grey;

I have seen no fire flies since I left
[place]place_942|Bologna[/place]: now on the veronese road, which
I traveled late. so the season over, or does
the neighbourhood of the [place]place_247|Alps[/place] interfere?
Yet I saw them at [place]place_1063|Domo D'Ossola[/place] even in
the end of June (about the 24[superscript]th[/superscript]. or 25[superscript]th[/superscript]).
The [misc]misc_726|waller[/misc] I have just eaten (2 OClock; -
for I have adopted the dining habits of the
Country: 12 is the hour) and I do not think
it pre-eminent - very like a [misc]misc_358|whiting[/misc], softer
than a [misc]misc_725|Barbot[/misc], but good and clean tasted.
The wine of [place]place_181|Carniola[/place] is excellent both
here and at [place]place_428|Adelsburg[/place] and [place]place_1064|Planina[/place];
it is probably the same, for they call it
"[underline]welsh[/underline]" which I presume means [underline]foreign[/underline]; it
is certainly [underline]Krannish[/underline]. "[underline][unclear]Iballish[/unclear][/underline]" I find
means Italian [deletion]or French wine[/deletion] [insertion]probably from the Italian Carniole I suspect[/insertion]. I got some
[underline]"iron forte"[/underline], [chemical]chemical_370|cast iron[/chemical] from [place]place_214|Sava[/place] to ascertain
if it be not an alloy of [chemical]chemical_328|Silicum[/chemical]. All

About 2 miles before I reached [place]place_1065|Kranburg[/place]
the highest of the [place]place_329|Carinthian[/place] chain of
mountains came in view, its sides still
spotted with snow, and evidently [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
It is on the right of the pass of [place]place_339|Loibel[/place] in
going into [place]place_329|Carinthia[/place]. I saw fire flies in
great abundance; they appeared less
luminous than those of [place]place_097|Italy[/place]; I now am
almost certain I saw one in the valley
of the [place]place_260|Drave[/place]; I think about [place]place_309|Villach[/place].
Came to a new inn at [place]place_216|Laybach[/place] Dettila,
At [place]place_1066|Krainburg[/place] I came upon [place]place_214|the Sava[/place] at its
confluence with the [place]place_1067|Zura[/place]. These two rivers

[place]place_428|Adelsburg[/place] at 9 O.C.; the Chernitz see was
full of water, so that I could not see the

heat was intense; the Thermometer rose to 97.[superscript]o[/superscript]
and was never below 92.[superscript]o[/superscript] A friendly thunder
storm came on whilst I was at [place]place_339|Loibel[/place], and
the wind blew from the [place]place_247|Alps[/place]; so that after
3 O. C. it was tolerably cool.

to [place]place_589|Wippach[/place], where I found a fine trout
and [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] stream, and stopped. I caught
2 [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] and 7 trout this evening: the trout
averaged half a pound apiece, and one of the
[misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] must have been nearly two pounds
This stream rises from the [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] rock
and as I was informed, for my thermometer
is broken, is 6 [superscript]o[/superscript] or 7 [superscript]o[/superscript] Reameur in temperature,
The country here is pretty, and a very neat
clean inn.
11[superscript]th[/superscript] It was very hot, but a breeze of wind
at 9 O.C. induced me to try fly fishing.
I hooked four large trout, and landed two:
one must have been above two pounds,
and cut very red. The may fly was on
the water, and yesterday evening the duncat,
the alder fly, with may flies, and all the
insects known in June and the beginning of
July in [place]place_121|England[/place]. This is the best fishing
stream I have seen on the continent.
There are stags and roes in the woods
above, and [misc]misc_723|[underline]coturni[/underline][/misc] close to the town, but

the near [place]place_1064|Planina[/place] the river which is
supposed to empty the [place]place_1071|Urking See[/place] It issues
like many of the rivers of this country from
a bed of [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]. The duncat was on the
water this evening, and an infinite variety of
flies. I began fishing a 5 o'clock, and soon
caught 4 very fine trout above a pound
a piece, and one above two pound; I caught
these with very large flies, the peacock body
and red wing ; I changed my fly to the
red hackle with orange body and caught a
[misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] and a trout of 3/4[superscript]lb[/superscript] and one of
of 1 1/2[superscript]lb[/superscript] and one of 1[superscript]lb[/superscript]. I then changed for
the peacock harle, red hackle and white wing
and caught 6 noble graylings, all but
one above a pound, and one above two pounds;
altogether sixteen fish, this day, and I hooked
a great many more; by far the best days
fishing I ever had in July. I saw a
trout of at least 6 or 7 pounds, but he
was in stagnant water. Heard this day

probably have caught a very large trout in
this magnificent river: I saw one rise of

Is the melancholy and debility produced
by sickness favourable to intellectual
exertion? I believe so. The mind necessarily
becomes contemplative when the body is no
longer active, and the empire of sensation
yields to that of imagination. Under such
circumstances, likewise, the mind is sober
and disposed to discover realities, and values
quiet and comfort, more than pomp and
eclat. During the last fortnight I have seen
and felt some novelties; yet but for the
wretched state of body in which I am,
they probably would never have been
committed to paper.
I left [place]place_071|London[/place] on the 30[superscript]th[/superscript] of June, Lady M.

the most wonderful city in the world.
We left [place]place_1088|Greenwich[/place] at 2 O Clock, and before
nine we were coasting the Suffolk low
lands, and lost sight of land before it
was dark. A favourable wind and
steam enabled us to see the [place]place_1090|coast of[line]Holland[/place] next day at three, and before
the evening we had passed the [place]place_1091|Tixel[/place] and
the sand hills north of the [place]place_1091|Tixel[/place], and
were again on the apparently unbounded
ocean and saw the sun set in clouds,
which looked as the promise of another
fair day. In the morning we were
called up on deck to see [place]place_1048|heligoland[/place]
appearing, an abrupt rock, capped by
a light house scarcely distinct in consequence
of the dark sea and sky. The rain [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]

be a harbour round this rude island
but of course there is shelter from all
winds, and we anchored within a gunshot
of the town (1/8 of a mile) The houses are
constructed of wood, and in general low

but all the articles of life very cheap,
particularly bad wine and spirits, Madeira

-portionably cheap. The island is about
a mile long and principally covered with

surround it except on the South side

The highest points of the cliff appeared to
me to approach to 400 or 500 feet, no wheat

[deletion]locks[/deletion] [insertion]locks[/insertion] and blue eyes form the character of
both men and women; and as the women
labour hard, their forms are neither good
nor graceful. Next day 3[superscript]d[/superscript] July, we
dined with [person]person_875|[person]person_875|the Governor[/person][/person], and by the eve[superscript]g[/superscript]
were completely tired of the island. At six
we sailed with rather a rougher gale than
was pleasant, the gale increased and the
ship rolled: about 2, a thunder storm
came on, and to the relief both of my
mind from anxiety and my stomach
from sickness, the rain stilled the waters
About 12 the next day the weather was
agreeable, and the sea tolerably calm:
we were on the North Sea. About 2
the weather changed; a breeze came on which
strengthened into a gale. Towards night
the ship rolled considerably, [deletion]and I thought[/deletion]
[deletion]alarmingly;[/deletion] the water dashed over the

decks, and the vaunted power of steam
over the elements, was as nothing; yet
the steam carried us on, though slowly:
and after much labouring and some danger
and much dripping, and one death, that
of an unfortunate painter, we made the
Coast of [place]place_188|Norway[/place] at seven in the morning
my experiments ruined, and misfortune to
aggravate the misery of sickness.
I did not get out of bed till we fairly
lodged in our port [place]place_1092|[insertion]at Rleve[/insertion][/place]; for even the
desire of seeing a new Country, for some time
did not reanimate me to any exertion, so
strong had been the tossing of the wave.
We had gone to bed in sickness, storm &
darkness; in getting upon deck, what a contrast
All was calm beauty and repose. We were in
the bosom of a bason rather than a bay: the
water like a mirror, beautifully green, and
myriads of [misc]misc_230|Medusae[/misc] of the most beautiful

[page]46|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00046|dnp21d042pp|92563368[/page]
colours, like animated flowers, moving about
us some of them nearly 18 inches in [unclear]diam[/unclear]
and having antenne several feet in length
Above our heads was a bright blue sky
seen through a kind of telescope of
high rocks, covered with wood, the wood
of [place]place_121|England[/place], oak, birch, alder, and some
few pines, and wild roses and woodbines.
The steam boat was so close to the rocks
that we landed on them by a board
and it was a matter of wonder when
she could have made her entry - rocks
rose every where round us. The rocks
were [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], modelled by the rude and
primitive hand of nature: rude and
primitive, as far as these elder foundations
of our globe are considered. -
we soon landed and walked over [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
rocks to the town of [place]place_349|Mandals[/place] which is on
the other side of a fine river. The idea
of salmon fishing reanimated us and I

[page]47|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00047|dnp21d043pp|92563370[/page]
43
soon hired a boat, and we passed up the
river. The town of is built
entirely of wood, and seemed to contain
very few respectable houses. The inn was
uncomfortable enough; such beds, - hardly
big enough: the rooms without plaister or
paper, displaying the mass and the [underline]cut trees[/underline]
(pines of which the whole was built). Some
of the women were tolerably well looking:
both men and women very civil, probably
without the means of being hospitable.
The scenery about the river very peculiar.
Rocks, rising like islands out of the sand,
or really islands in the sea from 100 to
600 feet high, and covered with wood; &
so numerous and so various in their forms, colour
and distribution of masses, as to be very
beautiful. The river was of the size of the
[place]place_350|Tweed[/place] before it joins the [place]place_351|Tiviot[/place], and had
the reputation of affording the best salmon
in [place]place_188|Norway[/place]. We rowed against the stream

[page]48|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00048|dnp21d044pp|92563371[/page]
the scenery constantly becoming more
beautiful. The woods came down to the
waters edge: there were some cliffs, but
no precipitous ones. The banks were green
slopes with the wood peculiar to [place]place_121|England[/place]
and most of the flowers and beautiful
meadows close to the water which was
very transparent, with a hue in which
amber predominated, but not peaty,
The outline was generally formed by rocks,
some of which in the distance were covered
by pines. I threw the fly in vain for
an hour, and then let it trail behind the
boat, when two or three unlucky trout
were taken, which were like the English
small trout. We were resolved to procure
a salmon for our dinner, and waited
till a net was drawn when several
were caught, one of which must
weighed 20[superscript]lbs[/superscript]: I purchased one about 9[superscript]lb[/superscript]
for 2 shillings. We continued till we
were stopped by the rapid, where the rocks

[page]49|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00049|dnp21d045pp|92563372[/page]
45
came down close to the river, and where
the scenery was more wild, and upon a greater
scale. here we left the boat and walked
about a mile to the fall of the [place]place_352|Mandals'[line]river[/place], which is rather a rapid than a fall,
a succession of foaming stream and pool,
where the water leaps from rock to rock
from 4 feet to 10 feet, and over which salmon
easily make their way. The narrow
channel through which the river runs is
very picturesque and the birch trees grow
close to the fall as if out of the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] rocks
The sun was bright, yet I thought myself
sure of a salmon; but my still was vain,
I saw two or three rise, & one I believe at
my fly; but neither this day nor the evening
after had I any success. Next day,
[person]person_258|[person]person_258|Lord Clifton[/person][/person] and I, went to a saltwater
lake or pond where we caught 4 sea trout
very good and red, with artificial flies: they
rose very freely. Here the scenery was

[page]50|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00050|dnp21d046pp|92563374[/page]
exquisitely beautiful: a succession of arms
of the sea, all like inland lakes, full of
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] Islands, and surrounded by high
hills covered with the richest kind of
vegetation: the rose, the woodbine the
laurel tree, and all our English flower; and
Mountain ash, and birch and oak in profusion
Every moment we opened on a new scene
as we passed by in our boat. We asked
if there was no fresh water near, looking
for a stream [deletion]in[/deletion] which we might fish;
they carried us to a spot where evidently
a torrent sometimes passed, and in less
than 20 yards we found ourselves on
the rocky brink of an inland fresh water
lake, so beautiful as the upper [place]place_106|lake of[line]Killarney[/place], and something like it. Here
we fished without success, but we were
recompensed by the agreeable nature of
the scenery, which was exquisitely beautiful
In addition to the other cloathing of the
rock, heath, juniper, the blackberry, even

[page]51|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00051|dnp21d047pp|92563375[/page]
47
found here in abundance; and the lake
was full at the borders of the most beautiful
water lilies. In this lake the boatman
informed us char was found; at least
from their description, it must have been
this fish.
I was told of a fall on a river about
6 miles to the west; I mounted a Norwegian
pony and went with the Son of the
innkeeper. This journey the scenery was
beautiful throughout the ride. Two fine
fresh water lakes came in view with
many wooded islands; the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] rocks
assumed more the character of mountains
and fine woods clothed their tops. The
road was rugged, and accessible only
for horses and the wretched little [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]cars[/insertion] of
the country, something like those of [place]place_156|Naples[/place]
and which upon these rocky paths, must
be painfully jolting. The vallies for five
miles were narrow, and the scenery lake

[page]52|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00052|dnp21d048pp|92563376[/page]
and rock covered with wood. We passed
a mountain torrent beautifully banked
and wooded, where I saw a number of
small trout. After we had attained
the summit of the second mountain
we saw a deep pastoral valley, at
the termination of a lake below; and
after mounting a second hill, more
cultivated than any we had passed
came to the river, which rolled through
a broad valley bounded by cliffs of
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], with pine covered hills beyond
The river was full of green weeds:
I saw a few trout in it, but no salmon.
The scenery was very beautiful all the
way to the fall, which was not very
fine. A small body of water fell
perhaps 30 or 40 feet: but all the rocks
around were disfigured by saw mills, and
the water covered with deals, and hills
of saw dust close to the banks of the

[page]53|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00053|dnp21d049pp|92563378[/page]
49
[deletion]river. I ought to have mentioned, that
in the river at [place]place_349|Mandals[/place] my evening fishing
was disturbed by large pine trees floating
down every minute, which must have
caught the attention of the Salmon, and
have prevented their feeding. This was
particularly the case in the evening that
I fished there, which otherwise was very
favorable for fishing. The next day
July I took my rod to the little
mountain stream which I found full
of trout, and in less than three hours
I caught 3 dozen but the largest was
not 3/4 of a pound, in weight, and the
average that of the small Welsh and Scotch
brook trout. [person]person_258|Lord C.[/person] who went on the
salt water lake had not so much sport
He raised a cod fish with his fly, and
caught the green sea pike
which associates with the mackerel in its
migration. After spending 4 days at[/deletion]

[place]place_349|Mandals[/place], we left it in the Steam boat
for Christansand. we had a little
rough Sea in going out of the port,
afterwards, a delightful voyage between
rock, and islands, some bare and some
wooded and through channels, sometimes
not so wide as our vessel was long, and
in perfect calmness. Here we saw the
first Sea Eagle, and many birds which
appeared eider ducks, and other water fowl
We arrived in four hours at [place]place_354|Christiansand[/place]
[deletion]The inhabitants of [place]place_349|Mandals[/place] were kind
rather than hospitable, probably from
the want of means; yet we had no reason
to complain of [person]person_876|Mr Robertson[/person]; the Innkeeper's
bill, though he was a Scotsman. In
[place]place_354|Christiansand[/place] we had great reason to complain
of the bill at the house where we lodged;[/deletion]
[deletion]but[/deletion] [insertion]here[/insertion] we met with great hospitality, dining
out every day [deletion]we staid there[/deletion] [unclear][insertion]were around[/insertion][/unclear]: the first day
with the consul of the [misc]misc_728|Hansalate towns[/misc]; the

second, with the British vice Consuls
[person]person_259|Consul Rienhard[/person], the [misc]misc_728|Hanseatic[/misc] consul, took
me to see the [place]place_353|Torndale[/place] [insertion]Torjedahl[/insertion] which empties itself
into the harbour of [place]place_354|Christiansand[/place]. The harbour
itself is a very fine one, with the peculiar
Norwegian features of rocky islands, high
[chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] crags, more or less covered with
trees, and promonteries generally topped with
firs. The quantity of firs was greater on this
coast, than at [place]place_349|Mandals[/place], and the valley of
the [place]place_353|Torndale[/place] displayed more fir wood, than
wood of any other kind; yet occasionally
birch, alder, and oak, appeared on the bank,
and birch was not uncommon. The glen
leading to the [place]place_353|Torridale[/place] was narrower, but
the rocks on a grander scale, than any thing
we had yet seen. The river itself, a fine
majestic stream, as large as the [place]place_355|Rhone[/place]
[place]place_356|Lyons[/place], of a fine green colour, and perfectly
fransparent; presenting every where along its
banks the unpicturesque riches of [place]place_188|Norway[/place];

[page]56|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00056|dnp21d052pp|92563382[/page]
the white stripped and trimmed floating forests,
From a point of rock, near [person]person_259|Mr Reinharts[/person]
country house, I saw a salmon leap in the
river just below one of those great chains
of fir, which are placed to arrest the
wood floated down from the mountains
in the interior. The dinner at [person]person_259|Mr Reinharts[/person]
was plentiful, [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]but[/insertion] a mixture of German
and English, without the kipper salmon and
spirits. Toasts were given, and wine drunk
with moderation; Bordeaux and excellent Hock
of 1811, and excellent Madeira, with cherries and
Strawberries: At our dear Hotel, we had
excellent cherries and strawberries, and greene
pease. [person]person_879|Mr Mark[/person], the English Vice Consul
invited us to dinner next day, to dine and
go first to the waterfall, where he promised
I should catch a Salmon by hook or by crook
We went off at nine oclock, and took boat
at 4 miles from [place]place_354|Christiansand[/place], and by the
help of four oars went up the river, the banks

[page]57|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00057|dnp21d053pp|92563384[/page]
53
of which we found of the same character
as those I had already seen; rude rock, hills
covered with oak, birch, and alder; cliffs with
pines above, and a variety of pool and stream.
At half a mile from the fall, the scenery
became wilder, and we were obliged to walk,
we want to a country house of the consuls
and found there excellent refreshments; kipper
salmon, cheese and [place]place_570|Hamburgh[/place] sausages, with
white and red Bordeaux. We soon came in
sight of the fall; a magnificent rush of
water, nowhere perpendicular, yet making
a grand display of one of the great machines
of nature. I should rate the succession
of descents (two being principal) at 120 or 130
feet, and there are many rapids below, It
is disfigured by sawmills, and in my opinion
by the rushing down and constant appearance
of the floating wood: yet it was a grand
sight, and the fir woods upon the surrounding
hills and the island which divides the river

[page]58|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00058|dnp21d054pp|92563386[/page]
into two parts, used the immense extent of
rapid, all white upon bright green, had a very
fine effect. No salmon rise above this fall,
which in point of quantity of water; I think
surpasses that of the [place]place_266|Rhine[/place] at Shaffhausen
but is inferior to it in perpendicularity and
in picturesque accompaniments. We returned
to dinner at Mr Marks, where we again found
kipper salmon, anchovies, brown bread and
butter and various liqueurs. This was the
prelude to the dinner. Our first course
was ham and, peas boiled with sugar in
their shells, then cutlets of veal very badly
fried: then came salmon (which I had myself
crimped) boiled: then chickens roasted with
abundance of parsley in their bellies. Then
roast veal; and last of all cranberry jelly
most delicious, with cakes and sweet things
We had plenty of fruit upon the table
before dinner which served as the garnish
and both here and at [person]person_259|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Reinharts[/person], salad

[page]59|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00059|dnp21d055pp|92563388[/page]
55
salad with cheese after dinner; the salad
being very good, particularly the cucumbers
which had been prepared by being kept
sometime in salt, and then washed, which
makes them tender, and abstracts their
unwholesome juice, which separates in large
quantities. Two [underline]culinary hints[/underline]. Roast
[underline][unclear]four[/unclear] fowls[/underline] with plenty of parsley in their
bellies. Place sliced cucumbers, if you wish
X them to be wholesome in [underline]salt[/underline]. Another:
Eat kippered salmon [underline]raw[/underline], with pepper and
bread and butter. Bordeaux, Madeira
and Port, were the wines all drunk with
dinner; their toasts, their healths, and short
speeches all during dinner. After the cakes
and the last toast we went to coffee, and
then home, though the hospitable master
of the house offered us supper and [underline][unclear]Bishop[/unclear][/underline]
probably wine and water, hot. -
We left [place]place_354|Christiansand[/place] [insertion]in the[/insertion] this morning at 12
and at 4, found ourselves safely moored

[page]60|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00060|dnp21d056pp|92563390[/page]
in the harbour at [place]place_357|[underline]Arendal[/underline][/place]. We passed
generally within the rocks, and had the
same kind of scenery as in our voyage
from [place]place_349|Mandals[/place] an immense variety of
little rocky [underline]islands[/underline] constantly opening
us; and sometimes our channel seems
hardly large enough for the passage of
the boat. The harbour of [place]place_357|Arendal[/place] is
very beautiful, and the town most singularly
placed upon a rock, with rocks surrounding
it, and deep water close to the houses.
Trees crown the rocks, and neat little houses
come close the waters edge. I went
immediately to a beautiful wooded rock
just above the town, where the [place]place_349|Mandal[/place]
scenery appeared as if echoed upon the
river of [place]place_357|Arendal[/place]. I likewise went
to visit the iron mines, which are very
curious in [chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical], with all the [underline]rare specimens[/underline]
well known to mineralogists. One of the mines [insertion]mines[/insertion]
presents a very fine excavation and you
look out upon a tranquil little lake with

[page]61|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00061|dnp21d057pp|92563391[/page]
57
pastoral and wooded scenery around it
The day after, a row to the fall of the
river: - not so large as that of the [place]place_353|Torridale[/place]
but with the same features: the banks pastoral
the usual vegetation below, and pines above.
Where one branch of the river enters the
sea, close to the fresh water, and in what
can be scarcely brackish water, myriads of
beautiful [misc]misc_230|Medusae[/misc] were to be seen; but none
in the absolutely fresh water. In the afternoon
we went to M[superscript]r[/superscript] Tidicamps country seat to
a feast - a dinner, where all the neighborhood
was invited; where [underline]cabbage[/underline] was the first dish
put on the table, after the usual prelude of
anchovies, sausages, and spirits; [underline]the anchovies[/underline]
[underline]excellent.[/underline] After the cabbage came [underline]ham,[/underline]
carved and served, as by a [underline]servant maid,[/underline]
by the young lady of the house, a very
pretty girl (bye the bye, her cousin, whom
I saw in the morning, was the prettiest girl
I had seen in [place]place_188|Norway[/place]) after the ham, cutlets
and peas, dressed in the shells: then chickens

[page]62|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00062|dnp21d058pp|92563392[/page]
with parsley; the cakes and jelly/goosberry
cake,/ with plenty of Bordeaux and Madeira
and toasts during the whole of dinner:
When I gave [nonenglish]nonenglish_208|[underline]Liberty, Freyheit[/underline][/nonenglish], the whole
party rose and sang a song in full
chorus. My health was drank, and the
Royal Society, and [insertion]the British[/insertion] constitution, and the
memory of [person]person_118|Lord Byron[/person]. After dinner
we all shook hands, and then walked
to see a most magnificent view. The
sea on one side, and wood almost
interminable [insertion]with lake and mountain,[/insertion] on the other, and a thousand
little ponds all surrounded by wood.
Some mountains of apparently the elevation
of [place]place_1097|the Grampians[/place] in the back ground, but
without snow. We were struck at
[place]place_357|Arendal[/place] by the manner in which the
women were treated. The postmaster was
rowed to the [person]person_879|vice Consul's[/person] to this grand
dinner by a female servant, who was
rather good looking and young, and who
dashed through the surge as a [place]place_825|Thames[/place] boatman

[page]63|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00063|dnp21d059pp|92563395[/page]
59
would have done, with her great hulking
master, sitting opposite to her. I was carried
across the lake from the iron mines, by a
boatwoman. The ladies [underline]speak[/underline] only Norwegian
but I saw piano fortes, which marked, at least,
the love of music. From the time we landed
in [place]place_188|Norway[/place] till now, we have had no night:
the twilight in the west is succeeded by
twilight in the east; and at midnight I could
read the smallest print. The Norwegian
rivers that we have hitherto seen are all
beautifully clear, and display their mountain
origin, and their passage through lakes; the
tendency of colour is to green, but no peatiness,
nor have I yet seen any river with that
celestial blue which characterizes the [place]place_355|Rhone[/place]
I caught in the [place]place_353|Torridal[/place] two Trout and
a sea trout, about the size of a large herring -
In the [place]place_357|Arendal[/place] river I caught nothing; I
am sure the saw mills and saw dust must
interfere greatly with the fisheries in these
magnificent streams.

[page]64|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00064|dnp21d060pp|92563396[/page]
July We left [place]place_357|Arendal[/place] at 2 in
the morning, and passed through our usual
fine scenery, sometimes almost touching
the little islands covered with wood, then
launching a few miles into the northern
ocean, and seeing between us and the shore
thousands of islands and rocks: We saw
no seals, and the Sea birds were not so
numerous as I had expected. The male
[underline]eider duck[/underline] we saw in flocks of 4 or 5,
flying like a black cock: one sea eagle
soared above us; gannets, gulls, sea
Swallows and the oyster catcher, were
not uncommon. At 12 the next day
we anchored in the harbour of [place]place_432|Lanwig[/place],
more open than any harbour we had yet
seen. I examined my experiments, the
results of which were very satisfactory, and
landed and examined the [chemical]chemical_226|Zircon[deletion]gant[/deletion][insertion]ite[/insertion][/chemical] rocks
I saw [chemical]chemical_226|Zircon[/chemical], I believe, in one specimen.
The [chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical] very fine, with immense
chrystals of [chemical]chemical_103|Hornblende[/chemical], and the [chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical]

[page]65|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00065|dnp21d061pp|92563397[/page]
61
having in some places the lustre of the
[chemical]chemical_104|feldspar[/chemical] of Labrador. The arm of the bay
of Llorwig wooded even to the sea: a small
river as large as the N. Esk, in which
they Salmon come up late in the year -
but the usual disfigurement of mills and
iron works close to the town.
Havin no object in staying at Llorwig
we left it f[deletion]rom[/deletion]or [place]place_358|Fredericshal[/place] at 2 O Clock
and going rather farther from the coast,
passed alongside islands of a larger size, and
saw mountains of rather a higher character
in the Norwegian land. We crossed the
[place]place_434|Fiord of Christiana[/place] without ever losing sight
of land, and at five found ourselves
amongst rocky islands, topped with pines
in the mouth of the [place]place_364|Glommen[/place], the largest
river in [place]place_188|Norway[/place]. The masses of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
in these islands are larger; the underwood
and flower bearing wood less, and the whole

[page]66|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00066|dnp21d062pp|92563399[/page]
scenery ruder. The stream rather whitish
but not muddy, flowed rapidly by the
rocks; yet we moved more rapidly against
it, and soon anchored before [place]place_1098|hedenefel[/place]
The [place]place_364|fall of the Glommen[/place] being only 6
English miles off I ordered [insertion]requested[/insertion] the Captain
to sail up [insertion]ascend[/insertion] the stream to it, and we had
a most brilliant evening, dashing through
the rapids of this immense river which I
think exceeds in size the [place]place_217|Danube[/place] at [place]place_898|Vienna[/place]
The banks were beautiful, but not wild,
cornfields, wooded hills, and some rocky
cliffs. We anchored at the termination
of the rapid in a rush of whirlpool,
close to the shore, and passed the night
on board. It was amusing to see the
wonder of the people who came out to
see this new phenomenon of the steam
boat going against wind and tide, and
who from their exclamations, probably
took us for [place]place_876|Lapland[/place] wizards.

[page]67|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00067|dnp21d063pp|92563400[/page]
63
A person who asked us to take him up
the river invited us to his fathers house, close
to the fall; and in the morning the elder
brother and our friend came down to take us
up in two carriages. We were soon at the
fall, which is a grand [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]rush[/insertion] of water not
perpendicular, but in its descent, does not
make less than 100 feet of white water.
It is the grandest rush of water I ever saw
and after the descent, boils and foams for a
half a mile: Salmon never rise above it.
Boats have been sometimes carried down and
dashed with their burdens into pieces. From
the top of the fall where the river is perfectly
still, beautifully smooth, and a quarter of a
mile at least in breadth, it is a grand
sight to see this enormous mass suddenly
converted into foam and white wave, dashing
with an irresistable shock and a noise like
thunder over immense masses of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical],
Saw mills are here likewise, but less offensive

from the immense magnitude of the river;
and fir trees seen at the bottom are like
chips and straws in one of our English rivers
[deletion]We were invited by the father and elder
brother of the young man whom we brought
from [place]place_1099|Frederickshall[/place] to dine and spend the
evening. The name of the family was Trane:
they were very kind to us. One of the
daughters was very pretty, and spoke
French and English, and was accomplished;
she was engaged they said to be a young Atill[superscript]y[/superscript]
officer: this was the most educated Norwegian
beauty I had yet seen. I slept in the
house. After supper I had a singular
compliment paid to me by the master of
the house, which from the degree of refinement
of the party must have been a joke.
"One of these young ladies must sleep
with you: they must cast lots" He spoke
English very ill, but this was his meaning
I took leave, and slept sound by.[/deletion] [deletion]The[/deletion]
[deletion]servant maid I found up in the morning[/deletion]

[deletion]and so civil, that I suspect her virtue was[/deletion]
[deletion]not of the most severe kind. The whole[/deletion]
[deletion]family appeared kind and hospitable. During[/deletion]
[deletion]the night before I fell asleep I heard the[/deletion]
[deletion]murmuring of the water fall.[/deletion]
We left the [place]place_364|fall of the Glommen[/place] at seven
in the morning and at 12 we were at
[place]place_1100|Stronstadt[/place]. The coast was wild: we sailed
between rocky islands covered with wood,
principally pine, but sometimes oak and
birch. There was more of grandeur in
the outlines, but not the same variety
as in [place]place_188|Norway[/place]; but the same immense
masses of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] and the same myriads
of islands. The day was dark and stormy
and harmonized well with the scenery.
[underline][place]place_246|Sweden[/place].[/underline]
I had seen very little of the Norwegian
inns; but the first specimen of a Swedish
inn was far worse than any thing I had

[page]70|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00070|dnp21d066pp|92563406[/page]
yet experienced. The inn at [place]place_1100|Stronstast[/place]
was dirty, the beds bad, the fare worse.
Rye bread and bad butter; the only thing
tolerable, a cutlet apparently made of
[underline]minced raw meat[/underline]. This is a good hint
for tenderness, as it does away one of the
great evils of fresh killing. [deletion]It would be[/deletion]
[deletion]a good plan to adopt in [place]place_235|Scotland[/place]; but[/deletion]
[deletion]then it would be necessary to have a proper[/deletion]
chopper and to carry a clean board.
Stromstadt is a small town on [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
rocks, with a variety of coast, and its lands
of the same character. A lake containing
pike and coarse fish is emptied by a
small river which runs through the town,
We got into a boat and fished for pike
with flies, [person]person_258|Lord Clifton[/person] took a small one,
On landing from the lake upon a small
promontory we found abundance of berries
in the English state of perfection: cranberries
blueberries, raspberries, and unknown black
juicy berry - [deletion](a vaccinum?) strawberries,
or juniper[/deletion]

[page]71|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00071|dnp21d067pp|92563408[/page]
67
and juniper berries. [person]person_258|Lord Clifton[/person] collected
a large quantity for three black game fowls
he had bought for a guinea, alive and of
last year. Here I bought a miserable
carriage, and next day began my journey
to [place]place_962|Gothenburg[/place], over heath and a country
like [place]place_235|Scotland[/place] with abundance of blue
berries growing to an immense size and
very good, [deletion]and likewise the other berry like[/deletion]
[deletion]a small juniper, but not and certainly[/deletion]
[deletion]not a juniper, at least, not like one juniper[/deletion]
[deletion]and the same kind is abundant here.[/deletion]
Nothing could be more dreary than the first
20 miles of this journey: the country like
[place]place_018|Ireland[/place] or the worst part of [place]place_235|Scotland[/place],
and generally without wood; a slight
cultivation of barley and oats, but for
the greater part wastes. The port houses
wretched hovels inhabited by peasants
apparently very ill off. We now passed
through a large forest of pines and the

[page]72|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00072|dnp21d068pp|92563409[/page]
country became rather more interesting
but there were no grand pictures. As
we approached to [place]place_1096|Questrin[/place] where I was
to dine, the country became richer, and
wooded vallies began to break the uniformity
of hills and heath. A peaty river which
is said to contain salmon flows through
[place]place_1096|Questrin[/place], and here the whole valley is
very fine with noble views of inlets of
the sea, with the usual character of
fiord rock and wood. The sea broke
in upon the view more or less from
[place]place_1096|Questrin[/place] to [place]place_1101|Undevella[/place], and all this country
may be regarded as picturesque, and has
an air of comforts, and where cultivated
appeared well cultivated. [place]place_1101|Undevella[/place] is
a town close to the sea, the salt water
flowing up to the houses, and with a port.
I found the inn very bad - at least compared
with the inns of [place]place_121|England[/place] or France, but not
unreasonable. I do not know that I ever

[page]73|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00073|dnp21d069pp|92563411[/page]
69
went a more disagreeable journey, than
that of this day: not understanding the
language, I could never satisfy the peasants,
who were rude and coarse; and my forbode
though it prevented me from waiting for horses
did not secure me civility; and the peasants
finding I could not speak Swedish, endeavoured
to impose upon me. The weather likewise was
stormy, with a bright sun, and a road which
was covered with clouds of dust. The travelling
is cheap enough: 16 shillings in the Country
and 20 in town each horse, for 6 English miles.
48 shillings are equal to the 12 of the pound
sterling; so that each horse costs 6 3/4 the Swedish
mile, and 3 horses 1[superscript]s[/superscript].8[superscript]d[/superscript] British, for 6 miles.
From Undevelle next day, I pursued my road
to [place]place_1102|Wenersburg[/place], and found the Country improve
There was a good deal of pine wood with crags
of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], and a succession of small wooded
hills, with small peaty streams, the outline of
the country was generally made up of great

[page]74|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00074|dnp21d070pp|92563412[/page]
forests of pines. A [place]place_1102|Wenersburgh[/place], the great
[place]place_1103|lake Wener[/place] opened upon me with all the
characters of the ocean; the banks are low,
and the horizon is more than one half sky
A little below [place]place_1102|Wenersburgh[/place], I caught the first
view of [place]place_1104|the Gotha[/place], a very fine, clean, and
greenish river, about the size of the
[place]place_355|Rhone[/place] at [place]place_356|Lyons[/place]. It pours with great
fury beneath a bridge thrown from rock
to rock, over which we passed, and makes
a fine rapid, or almost a fall: there is
another rapid or fall of the same kind, just
below. The banks are well wooded, but
here too, there are no very fine distances
a sort of extended [insertion]fascades ridges[/insertion] of rock, capped
by pines, extends to the left, and may have
been an ancient bank of the river; from
its distant appearance I should conjecture
it to be trap; [deletion]but I saw no [insertion]fragments[/insertion] stones[/deletion]
[deletion]of this rock, and[/deletion] [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] is the rock of
of the country. I passed by some small
lakes, over some wild heaths, and at last

[page]75|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00075|dnp21d071pp|92563414[/page]
71
came upon me the white foam of the cataract
of [place]place_362|Trolhetta[/place] rising like smoke amongst the
Village. The river above is a fine wide, and
tranquil expanse; at first it is tortured in
its fall by saw mills; but at the second
fall they disappear. Here there is nothing
but the grand forms of nature, the bold grand
cliffs, 200 or 300 feet high, covered with an
almost infinite variety of kinds of wood, and
capped by gigantic pines. The water is
beautifully clear, and the rapids and falls for
nearly half a mile present a [deletion]variety of[/deletion] picture
-esque effect. Here a deep whirlpool beneath
a fall of 20 or 30 feet in height, and where
the river is pressed into the narrowest possible
channel. There a succession of rapids, and
all white foam, and force, and thunder. I
fished and caught nothing but a little trout as
long as my hand; though I was told of large
trout of 6,7, or 8 pounds, inhabitants of the
pool below the mill: yet the evening was favorable

[page]76|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00076|dnp21d072pp|92563415[/page]
and I tried my best flies and my best skill.
The inn was very bad; the master and mistress
the governess and the children, feasting and
out playing cards. It was on a Sunday that
I arrived: I could get nothing except what I
brought and what my servant collected in the
garden, and I was made sick even by this
fare. I got up very early on Monday and
examined the opposite side of the fall and went
down to the locks, a fine work of art, when
the navigation is carried on between [place]place_962|Gottenburgh[/place]
and the Wenersee. The locks are deep in
the [chemical]chemical_100|Gneis[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical], altogether 120 feet
in depth, and giving many fine falls and
effects of water where they are to be filled
from the clean and beautiful stream of [place]place_1104|the[line]Gotha[/place]. The first natural fall seen from
that opposite, is very fine. There is as island
covered with wood in the middle which has
much of the saw mills. The salmon never
rise above the falls, and there are very few of
them: I am convinced they can never abound

[page]77|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00077|dnp21d073pp|92563417[/page]
73
where there are many saw mills and much
saw dust. I left the wretched inn for Gottenburg
at 9 this day () I got on much
better; at least I had no attempts at imposition
on the part of the peasants. Throughout
[place]place_188|Norway[/place] and [place]place_246|Sweden[/place], the only birds I saw
by the road side, except a few birds of prey
were magpies and hooded crows: the magpies
were in myriads and quite tame; so tame that
I could have killed four or five together.
The Swedes and Norwegians do not shoot them
and animals soon find out their places of
preservation. There was more beauty in the
road this day, particularly by the banks of a
small lake, where there was a great extent
of wood and rock, and some islands: but
this lake could only be called [underline]pretty[/underline].
We passed through some large pine woods
and opened open [place]place_1104|the Gotha[/place], the banks of
which down to [place]place_962|Gottenburgh[/place] are green with
a plain or flat surface of heath, interweaving
between the river and the hills. The hills possess

[page]78|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00078|dnp21d074pp|92563418[/page]
some variety; and the [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] crags and
trees, and great diversity of hilly outline
is not devoid of picturesque effect.
[place]place_962|Gottenburgh[/place] is principally built of stone,
has a few fine houses; and [place]place_1104|the Gotha[/place]
and the harbour form important commercial
characters. The inn, as usual, wretched;
the [underline]cuisine insupportable[/underline]. The bread was
[underline]cockroach pudding[/underline]; I swallowed one, and
found another. The fatigue of travelling, and
the misery of the inn, which was like an oven
the windows having been kept closed, and the
bad food at [place]place_362|Trolhetta[/place], all together, brought
on a violent bilious attack with fever, which
lasted four days. The third day, however, I
went to the marshes, and saw [person]person_880|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Bloomfield[/person]
shoot what appeared to me to be a [underline]Finland[/underline]
 [underline][misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc][/underline]. I went out myself the day after, and
shot two or three wading birds, but found no
double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]. I shot a young [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc], and
they say the [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc] sometimes breeds
in this neighbourhood. I strongly doubt this

[page]79|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00079|dnp21d075pp|92563420[/page]
75
I found an old [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc], with a young one,
the common [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc]; and I think it very likely
they have been deceived in taking the young
common [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc], which is larger and fatter
than the old one, for a young [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc]:
Yet the sportsman who spoke to me at
[place]place_1101|Undevilla[/place] said he had seen some young
double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc], and he seemed to me to know
the habits these birds well. He likewise
described the breeding habits of the [misc]misc_418|Woodcock[/misc]
and stated that they were not uncommon
in the summer in the great woods of [place]place_246|Sweden[/place]
I went out the next day shooting to endeavour
to ascertain more about the Finmark [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc];
but found no double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc], and killed only
a duck and a [misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc], and could find no
Finmark [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]. This day saw the
[person]person_881|Crown Prince of Sweden[/person] and [person]person_884|his Princess,[/person] He
received me amiably, and talked upon a great
many subjects, and generally well; seemed to
understand something of chemical science

[page]80|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00080|dnp21d076pp|92563421[/page]
and had general views upon all the sciences
and enlightened ideas upon education and
the policy of kings. He asked me to dine
with him, I sat on the left of the Princess
[person]person_875|the Governor[/person] of the town sitting next her
and a lady of the court next me. She
has a beautiful [underline]upper[/underline] countenance and
fine blue eyes; but I should think her
constitution feeble; the grand daughter of the
[person]person_885|poor Empress Josephine[/person] and very graceful
and gracious in her manners. She talked
to me about her Grandmother and Trolhatten.
He entered into a long conversation with
me after dinner [nonenglish]nonenglish_210|[underline]"de omnibus rebus, ut[/underline][line][underline]quibusdam aliis"[/underline][/nonenglish], particularly [place]place_761|Lancaster[/place] Schools
and the Atomic system of Chemistry, and
[person]person_889|Prince Christian; of Denmark[/person]; [deletion]character,[/deletion]
[deletion]who he said was too fond of[/deletion]
M[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_886|Nolan[/person] is a very hospitable and
amiable merchant, lent me a carriage
to come on to [place]place_1107|Helsingburgh[/place], and I hired
a man to take charge of me to [place]place_1106|Copenhagen[/place]

[page]81|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00081|dnp21d077pp|92563423[/page]
77
and to take back the carriage, my first
day was to [place]place_1109|Falkenburg[/place]: the road was very
pretty for the first two or three posts, and then
became very dreary, like the wildest part of
the low country in [place]place_1108|Aberdeen[superscript]sh[/superscript].[/place] There was very
little pine wood, and barren heath and barren
rocks formed a considerable part of the Country
with some barley and rye, and the rye cut
and potatoes here and there, and peat bogs
At [place]place_1109|Falkenburg[/place] I went immediately to the river
and fished, but raised nothing. Next morn[superscript]g[/superscript]
I went out and soon roused and hooked a
Salmon, and fished with a good deal of
spirit till dinner time. I killed four small
salmon; two I hooked and one I killed, having
seen them under the bridge, and in the evening
I killed two more: altogether I hooked 9
or 10, and killed six; but the largest was
not 6 pounds, and some of them were I think
the Salmo Er but they gave good sport
and took freely. I think there was a
place further up where I should have had

[page]82|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00082|dnp21d078pp|92563425[/page]
better sport and which I saw only in going
away. At [place]place_1110|La Holme[/place], I saw a very fine
river and was half inclined to stop; but
the wretchedness of the inn prevented me.
I saw a man fishing with a very large
bundle of [underline]lob worms[/underline], with which they
catch salmon; but they seem to know
nothing of the fly. My guide at [place]place_1109|Falken[line]-burg[/place] fished and caught one grilse with
a worm. Neither at Falconburgh, nor
at [place]place_1110|La Holme[/place], are there any saw mills;
and hence probably the salmon are found
in plenty. They have precisely the character
of second rate scotch rivers, and are not
so hardly fished; but I doubt whether the
Swedish fishery even in these rivers, can
be reckoned superior to the Scotch. A
gentleman had been there 3 weeks ago
and fished without catching a salmon,
and I believe I raised most of the salmon
that day in the pools that I tried.
From the appearance of the river at La

[page]83|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00083|dnp21d079pp|92563426[/page]
79
[place]place_1110|Holme[/place], I am almost sure I should
have killed salmon there; I saw a small
grilse rise. The colour of these waters is peaty
and the fall at [place]place_1110|La Holme[/place] is close to the
road. From [place]place_1110|La Holme[/place] to [place]place_1107|Helsingburgh[/place]
the country has nearly the same character
as that I have already described. There
seems nothing ever prepared in the Swedish
 inns for travellers; not even the delicacy
of kippered salmon. At [place]place_1111|Engelholme,[/place] I
had to wait an hour for horses, and likewise
at the stage next [place]place_1110|La Holme[/place], for there I
overtook my [insertion]Forbode[/insertion] though he had been sent
15 hours before I left [place]place_1109|Falkenburg[/place]. At
[place]place_1107|Helsingburgh[/place] I got a tolerable dinner, and
a bed in an enormous room, probably the
assembly room. Here I had an interview
with [person]person_349|Berzelius[/person], whom I found in good plight
rather fatter than when I saw him 12 years
ago. The next morning I hired a boat for
[place]place_1106|Copenhagen[/place], and [place]place_1112|left Elsineur and Hamlets[line]garden[/place] on my left and in four hours landed

[page]84|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00084|dnp21d080pp|92563428[/page]
in the Capital of Denmark.
[place]place_1106|Copenhagen[/place] is a pretty city; the palace
a fine building and the houses well built
and the inn tolerable. The voyage from
[place]place_1107|Helsingburgh[/place] was always along the [place]place_1113|green[line]fields of Zealand[/place], which here and there
were crested with low wood, not unlike
the banks of the [place]place_825|Thames[/place], with many Country
houses, all of which had an English fashion.
We passed by the 3 Crowns battery,
celebrated for its effects on the fleet of
our greatest naval Hero, and were as
usual strictly examined at the Custom
House which seemed to have rather for
its object, the extortion of money, than any
real desire to prevent Smuggling. I
dined at the Table d'Hote, the mistress of
the Inn was English, and had been probably
housekeeper or ladies maid, and had the
manners which belong to the shabby genteel.
The dinner was very good and the wine
excellent. I saw Professor [person]person_888|Oersted[/person], and

[page]85|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00085|dnp21d081pp|92563429[/page]
81
he shewed me his apparatus [underline]for increasing[/underline]
[underline]Thermoelectromagnetism[/underline]; but I have
some doubts as to the multiplication.
Found that [person]person_889|Prince Christian[/person] was in town
the day after my arrival, and went to
see him. He received me in the kindest
manner without ceremony, and asked me
to dine with him the next day. I
accepted conditionally, provided the
steam boat did not come, and fulfilled
my engagement. I found him very
amiable, in an agreeable country seat;
living like an English country gentleman
His villa was very like an English country
house of the second or third class. The
princess I found very much improved in
health and person, and quite blooming,
[person]person_888|Oersted[/person] was of the party, and some courtiers
The prince walked with me round his grounds
and after dinner took me to the [place]place_1114|Kings[line]Park[/place], a deer park, like an English one
very extensive, with some tolerable trees

[page]86|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00086|dnp21d082pp|92563430[/page]
I drank tea with [person]person_890|the Princess[/person] and then
took my leave. The public seemed to
consider the princes' grounds as their own
for there were numbers of persons walking
there to whom he bowed, and had much
that courtesy to perform. He asked me
to dine with him again on Sunday.
I obtained leave from [person]person_889|Prince Christian[/person] to
shoot at [place]place_1115|saltholme[/place] where it was said
double as well as single, and Jack [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]
breed. I went there on Saturday, and found
an immense variety of wading birds on
this low and flat island, an infinite
variety of the [misc]misc_729|Tringa[/misc] kind, red legs
green legs, the turnstone, the avocetta,
the sandpiper, [misc]misc_729|Tringa[/misc], Alpina in its
summer plumage, and exactly like a
[misc]misc_340|snipe[/misc]. I think I saw one [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc],
but was not sure, as there were no
white feathers in the tail. I unluckily
did not go to the South side of the
island till late, and then my [underline][nonenglish]nonenglish_346|Senzacura[/nonenglish][/underline]

[page]87|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00087|dnp21d083pp|92563432[/page]
83
servant threw me out by not putting powder
enough in my horn. The Chasseurs here,
are all positive as to the existence of the
[misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc] as a bird bred in Zealand.
I saw in the collection of Nat. History the
Norwegian white grouse of the size of our
grouse, and having precisely the same
summer plumage. Query, is it not the
same bird? Dined again with [person]person_889|the prince[/person]
on Sunday; a visit of ceremony; 30 people,
and of course rather a bore. Went away as
soon as possible. On Tuesday took the
[place]place_1116|Kiel[/place] boat and had a pleasant sail to
[place]place_1116|Kiel[/place], through the islands; and a most
wretched journey from [place]place_1116|Kiel[/place] to [place]place_570|Hamburgh[/place]
through sands and desarts.
In going from [place]place_1117|Atona[/place], Aug 8, to a country
seat, my companion in the carriage as
if casually said, that is [person]person_891|the grave of[line]Klopstock.[/person] It was [place]place_1118|under a lime tree[/place];
but I lost sight of it, and asked him
to be so good as to point it out to me

[page]88|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00088|dnp21d084pp|92563434[/page]
in returning. We returned at ten O. C.
in a calm and beautiful evening, I
saw two large stones surrounded by an
iron paling. Klopstock; and [person]person_893|[person]person_893|his first[line]wife;[/person][/person] and [person]person_892|[person]person_892|his second wife[/person][/person]; tomb, on the
side beyond the church yard was an
illuminated gate, and we asked why
it was so illuminated. At first I
 thought it was an honour paid to the
grave, and the memory of one of the
greatest poets [place]place_324|Germany[/place] has produced.
 It turned out to be a place, a
[unclear]Parish hall[/unclear], into which we entered, and
saw W + R. not one whom had
perhaps ever heard of Klopstock; such
is glory and greatness; such the illustrious
dead. The Poet of [otherwork]otherwork_244|the Messiah[/otherwork] has however
a name for this generation, and we know
his birth place and where his bones lie.
This day went in search of the [misc]misc_238|double[line]snipe[/misc], and did not find one; but
[person]person_894|Count Blucher[/person], [person]person_875|the Governor[/person] of [place]place_1117|Altona[/place]

[page]89|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00089|dnp21d085pp|92563435[/page]
85
sent me one which was in excellent
condition, and probably a young one.
It had no white feathers in its tail, but
some whitish ones, and had the speckled
breast which I have always seen in [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc]
of this kind. The whitish feathers were
spotted; whereas in the spring bird I
have always seen some pure white feathers
I have now no doubt, that the bird I saw
at [place]place_1115|saltholme[/place] was one of this species; and
I regret that I did not examine more the South
part of this island, where they are said
to breed.

I went after double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc], but found none;
[person]person_894|Count Blucher[/person], however, sent me one which
 I have already described. I have agreed
to go to [place]place_963|Bremen[/place] with [person]person_169|Schumacher[/person] to see
[person]person_168|Gauss[/person] and [person]person_167|Olbers[/person]; and I hope I may
be in [place]place_121|England[/place] by Sunday or Monday:
I do not like, however, to go without a

this day, Aug. 9 .
I did not describe the villages in [place]place_1123|Holstein[/place],
but at Keil the women appeared handsome
and upon a large scale [deletion]like their [unclear][underline]Maris[/underline][/unclear][/deletion]
 [deletion]and G[/deletion] and the houses of the farmers
had a grand display of culinary utensils
and looked in the Country as if all roof.
I saw water meadows, and rye cut, and
 some oats and barley. The horses exceedingly
fine and large, but I should think
with less blood in them than the English
horses; this struck me in Denmark. -
The Danes and Holsteiners appear to be

rather [underline]fatheaded[/underline], and a feeding and
 smoking people. I have been here now
4 days without the least chance of a

have done something for me, limiting
his civility to a dinner 5 miles from
town, and a late return, and an expence
of [superscript]Â£[/superscript]1. 5[superscript]s[/superscript]. 0 for carriage.
This day Aug 9. I have been out in a
flood of rain, and hunted over a great
extent of excellent moor, and found fewer
[misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] than we should find on the same
ground in [place]place_121|England[/place] or [place]place_018|Ireland[/place] - much
fewer than in [place]place_018|Ireland[/place] and [place]place_235|Scotland[/place].
But in that kind of ground so favourable
to the [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc], a long grass with
water covering it and green, we found
two [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc], but as it poured they were
very wild; One I saw; it had no white
feathers in its tail, like the one I saw
in September at [place]place_931|Venice[/place]. I dare say

[page]92|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00092|dnp21d088pp|92563440[/page]
if I gone to this spot yesterday I should
have killed one or two double [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc].
Query, is this bird a distinct species, or
is this the Summer plumage.
 Aug. 10. [superscript]th[/superscript] I dined with [person]person_169|Prof.[superscript]r[/superscript] Schumacher[/person],
whose amiable qualities have impressed me
more, the more I have seen him, and after
 dinner crossed the [place]place_1121|Elbe[/place] to [place]place_570|Hamburgh[/place]. We
were only an hour on our passage, and the
distant view of [place]place_570|Hamburgh[/place] and [place]place_1117|Altona[/place], and
the green pastures and wooded banks of the
 [place]place_1121|Elbe[/place] are not unpleasing as a view. It was
full tide, and the water came very high, so
that various wild flowers appeared with only
 their extreme branches above. At the first
town in [place]place_1122|Hanover[/place], [place]place_570|Hamburgh[/place], we were
assaulted by beggars and little boys who
mein lieber herr'd us for an hour with
most persevering insolence. The inn was
 tolerably good, and the G and supper
better than I had expected. The day after

[page]93|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00093|dnp21d089pp|92563441[/page]
89
we rose at 6. and proceeded to [place]place_963|Bremen[/place]
through a Country where heath and wood
were the principal features. On a heath
near [place]place_570|Hamburgh[/place] I saw a Covey of Partridges
which with two or three [misc]misc_340|snipes[/misc] on a moor
near [place]place_1124|Rottenburg[/place] were the only game I
had seen from the roads in the north.
Forests of great extent, with small hills, heaths
of great magnitude, and cultivated but not
enclosed land are the characters of [place]place_1122|Hanover[/place]
The peasants were good looking, the women
handsome; the inns appear better than any
in the north, the post horses good, but they
are slow, and the road though a work of
[person]person_119|Napoleon[/person], heavy.
11.[superscript]th[/superscript] Dined at the inn late, and had
a very fair supper, and found the inn
 tolerable. The next day dined with D[superscript]r[/superscript] [person]person_167|Olbers[/person]
and saw with much pleasure the telescope
with which he discovered his two new
 planets, and met [person]person_168|Gauss[/person] [person]person_167|Olbers[/person] gave

[page]94|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00094|dnp21d090pp|92563444[/page]
us an excellent dinner, and is a most
amiable and enlightened Philosopher; I
spent a very pleasant day. He introduced
me to a sportsman who asserted in the most
decided manner that the [misc]misc_238|double snipe[/misc] bred
in [place]place_1122|Hanover[/place] and promised to send me young
 ones. He says the males assemble in the
month of May and make a great noise
and that they breed in the great marshes,
I saw one in the museum with the egg,
which seems to confirm his account.
I find such difficulties made with respect
to the Chase here, that I gave up the idea
and on Friday came down to Bracken
along and on the water which has nothing
picturesque; and this morning 14[superscript]th[/superscript] I am
on the Sea off [place]place_1125|Vanderogg[/place]. I am rejoiced
that I made the excursion to [place]place_1117|Altona[/place]
and [place]place_963|Bremen[/place]; if has given me a better
idea of human nature, for [person]person_169|Schumacher[/person]
[person]person_167|Olbers[/person] and [person]person_168|Gauss[/person], appear to me no less

amiable as men, than distinguished as

goodness of heart and urbanity of manners
which ought to make us proud of their

Notes made in a Journey through
the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place] in 1814-15.
The spirit of prediction belonging to
great minds, like the mountains, which
being highest first receives the rays of the
sun.
Those persons who have most reputation,
who are highest, like mountains are cold;
except that one meets, here and there, with
a [person]person_898|Madame de Stael[/person], a volcanoe.

 Oct 5. Left the inn where the people were
uncivil; the bill was 10 fl 30k, which
I objected to, but paid 10 and gave the
servants, who were in fact the innkeepers,
nothing. Passed on a few miles to the
Austrian frontier where the pass was
examined and permission given to go on
 to [place]place_277|Insbruck[/place]. The road to the first
part was through desolate vallies, bounded
by high mountains, the [place]place_1129|Isen[/place] much
diminished at our feet; all the mountains
calcaceous. Some birch, but the pine the
 common wood. Stopped on the side of
a hill at the post to change horses: the
scenery continued similar, and in going
up and down mountains we at last
gained a view of the valley of the [place]place_1129|Isen[/place],
a large river winding through a ravine
green and clothed with pine above high

mountains, with a sort of plain between
the bed of the river and the mountains;
some pasture in this plain, and a great
 deal of withered indian corn. A most
precipitous hill to descend and most uncivil
postilion, who shewed me his horse's knees
broken and kept a chain round the wheel
which had no drag.
The valley of [place]place_277|Insbruck[/place] disappointed me
the indian corn which every where sports
it gives it a parched character; probably
in the spring and summer it would
 be more beautiful. The mountains dark
in pines and above the black rock
with little ribbands or patches of snow.
The [place]place_1129|Isen[/place] a river as large as the [place]place_609|Spey[/place] or
larger; bluish, and floating down immense
 quantities of wood. [place]place_277|Insbruck[/place] rather a
good town; some of the houses in the
Italian style, and a fine bronze monument

[page]102|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00102|dnp21d098pp|92563456[/page]
 in the Cathedral. The mountains hanging
over it in the most precipitous manner
Found at [place]place_277|Insbruck[/place] [person]person_1072|Sir T.[/person] and [person]person_1073|Lady[/person]

from the slowness of the Austrian post, and
 Police. Saw a collection where the
Salt of [place]place_1130|Halle[/place] was, and got from a man
calling himself Chevalier, two bits of blue
salt at the enormous price of 2 florins,
This salt work is in a [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] strata
and the salt alternates with [chemical]chemical_163|Gypsum[/chemical].

for rooms, and four for dinners, altogether
The scenery today, by far the finest I
have seen in the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place], and as fine as
I have ever seen. Deep glens, in two of
them the two blue rivers forming the
rolling and foaming over rocks of [chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical]
 and [chemical]chemical_095|micaceous[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Schist[/chemical]. The depth of the
glens much greater that in [place]place_198|Switzerland[/place],
 narrow, and pine and birch below; then
cultivated patches, and then pine and birches
and larch again; and above all, very
 high mountains, dark and frowning, but
having snows in their gullies, and bosoms,
and on their tops. The sky harmonized
with the grandeur and solemnity of the scene
it was clouded, but something like a
soft October day in [place]place_121|England[/place]; the clouds
of the finest white played amongst the
mountains, and gave to their dark firs
and nodding rocks, a deeper gloom by

[page]104|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00104|dnp21d100pp|92563459[/page]
contrast. Now and then the sun burst
forth, and made the yellow birch lighten
into tints of gold.
The river rolling by the town, and which
gives us trouts for dinner, is clear and
blue as the purest sapphire . I observed
 of [chemical]chemical_100|Gneis[/chemical] and [chemical]chemical_097|Sienite[/chemical], and a
[chemical]chemical_095|micaceous[/chemical] stone analagous to [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Schist[/chemical]
on the road, and the whole country
in which we now are seems primitive.
Oct. 12. At [place]place_625|Vicenza[/place]. Left Trente yesterday
morning at half past 5 O.C. and passed
through some of the most beautiful scenery
I ever saw; At first our road was up a
mountain where six horses were necessary
 Features the same as those in the neighbourhood
of Trente, and exquisitely beautiful. The
valleys clothed with vines sporting round
mulberry trees, elms, and fruit trees, and
now displaying ripe grapes. The mountains

all [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical], at least those so near as
to enable me to judge of their nature,
and blue, grey, reddish, or white.
The town of Trente in the midst of a
highly cultivated valley, watered by
the [place]place_426|Adige[/place], here a sober, pastoral, clear
river, as large or larger as the Tay
containing a few [misc]misc_313|Grayling[/misc] probably, but
trout and barbel certainly, and eels. I
however saw no fish in the river, and
we had rather a bad trout of 3/4 [superscript]w[/superscript] at the
inn. The road from Trente to [place]place_624|Bassano[/place]
exquisitely beautiful, the beautiful passing into
the sublime. When we came to the division
of the waters, (those which feed the [place]place_426|Adige[/place],
and those that feed the [place]place_619|Brenta[/place]) a rude
sort of porphyry began to appear, and
[chemical]chemical_095|micaceous[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Schist[/chemical], and hills covered with
snow above the [place]place_619|Brenta[/place] probably were
 [chemical]chemical_101|Mica[/chemical] [chemical]chemical_120|Schist[/chemical]. On descending, variety of

[page]106|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00106|dnp21d102pp|92563462[/page]
clothed hills rich in the varied vegetation
of birch, oak, wild grape, thorn, clematis
&[superscript]c[/superscript]. A small lake and then a larger
 one beautifully wooded, sending a
stream very small down to form the
[place]place_619|Brenta[/place]. All [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] below this lake
and a succession of valleys which recalled
to my mind the [place]place_085|Derbyshire[/place] glens
upon a larger scale, but vines in their
bosoms, always parasitical.
As we approached to [place]place_624|Bassano[/place], the
[place]place_619|Brenta[/place] becomes a large stream, most
clear and of a very pale bluish green
colour, It descends through a [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
chasm, onto the plain of the Vicensese
territory. All the [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical] stratified
in this part of the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place], and abundance
of arches and caves in it.

The plain between [place]place_624|Bassano[/place] and [place]place_625|Vicenza[/place]
not interesting, but at [place]place_625|Vicenza[/place] a
magnificent view of the
mountains and the [place]place_247|Alps[/place], and all the riches
of [misc]misc_575|Pomona[/misc] and [misc]misc_574|Bacchus[/misc] in the plain.
Palladian palaces in the city, and the hill
from which we had our view. [chemical]chemical_105|Basalt[/chemical]

examine this tomorrow.
March 30. 1815. I have again passed
thorough the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place] as far as [place]place_333|Bolzin[/place],
where we arrived at half past 3 O.C.
this day. We quitted [place]place_622|Verona[/place] yesterday
morning and came on to Trente by the
[place]place_607|Roverido[/place] road. The mountains all
[chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]; and about a mile from [place]place_607|Roverido[/place]
a scene of savage wildness and desolation

[page]108|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00108|dnp21d104pp|92563466[/page]
such as I never before saw. The valley
of stones in [place]place_162|Devonshire[/place] is a miniature
of it. The [place]place_426|Adige[/place] does not contain
much fish and rolls through meadows
with rows of mulberry trees: the olive
is little seen after [place]place_607|Roverido[/place], but the vine
the tree of the country, The [chemical]chemical_090|Limestone[/chemical]
mountains here begin to be topped with
firs rising amidst the snows; the
[place]place_1191|mediterranean[/place] pine below, the alpine
pine above; [place]place_198|Switzerland[/place] , as it were,
mingling with [place]place_097|Italy[/place]. The spring just
beginning, but the weather very hot in
the valley of [place]place_333|Bolzen[/place], as hot as our
July. The rocks just below [place]place_333|Bolzen[/place]
very picturesque, porphyry. The river
being very low and clear, but I think much
larger than the [place]place_609|Spey[/place]. Around [place]place_333|Bolzen[/place]
very grand scenery: peaks of [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical]
rising in the east and north from
snowy mountains: pines below, and

[page]109|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00109|dnp21d105pp|92563468[/page]
105
fresh wood in the valley, displaying the
delicate green of early spring. The inn
at Trente bad, and imposing. Here pay
for horses each post 5 florins (4 horses)
and 1 and 1/2 florin the one postilion.
Pay at the inn at [place]place_333|Bolzen[/place] about 9 shillings
for beds for 4 people. and 14 for dinner,
Ap. 2[superscript]d[/superscript]. In going up the [place]place_610|Brenner[/place],
observed two interesting phenomena.
The rivers formed by the melting of the
snow coming in contact with the warm
air, blowing up from [place]place_097|Italy[/place] threw down
steam from the air, so as [deletion]if[/deletion] seem as
if boiling. Saw a number of small
glaciers, formed by the snow water trickling
down amidst snow in the day, and frozen
in the night. Number of fine castles
in the [place]place_328|Tyrol[/place] on mountains, Pines and
larches the abundant trees after passing
the [place]place_610|Brenner[/place].

God governs man by the simplest

is bare; yet below the surface it is
covered with vegetation, fed by the

We know nothing at all of the scheme
or plan of the universe, but we believe
there is a plan. Consequently events
may in fact have a connection which
appear to [underline]us[/underline] the most unconnected and
remote. If the popular and anti-
-philosophical are of omens, prophecies
and prodigies be correct, this is the
only philosophical solution which
 can be given. The apparent raving

connection with the remarkable event
of which I am an historical witness,
no more than the rattling of the wheels
of a carriage at an inn door with
the death of Poultry; which however
we know it is the remote cause:
the chicken can as much fathom this,
as we can the mysteries of our own
being and nature.
Human life may be compared to
mountain scenery in a cloudy and
windy day, when the clouds cover
more sky than is open. We wonder
at the bright light travelling rapidly
along the surface of the mountain;
and while we wonder, it is gone.
Now the distances appear in light, and

of futurity are bright in sunshine
and others dark in gloom.
The hopes that we have with respect
to another state of existence may
be compared to the reflections that
we see in the sky when we ourselves
are in gloom, from a distant sunny
country: we are conscious that there
is a lighted surface in sunshine,
though we are totally ignorant of the
source of it.
Our histories of past events are something
 like the wrecks upon the sea beach: things
are often thrown up because they happen
to be light, or because they have been
entangled in sea weed: i.e. facts
are preserved which suit the temper
or party of a particular historian.

The coming of the blast is shewn by
the noise of the distant wood. The
philosopher knows that vibrations in
the air travel infinitely quicker than
its currents, and to him the circum-
-stance is a scientific principle; whilst
to the savage it is only a vague
 omen. So omens of every kind if we
could trace the long chain of causes
and effects would be either naturally
associated symptoms, or causes.
To infinite wisdom, the past, the present
and the future are alike; and gleams
of that wisdom are sometimes bestowed
upon the meanest and most insignificant

The essence of happiness is pursuit:
either physical, - connected with our nutri[insertion]t[/insertion]ion
or reproduction, - as in hunting, fishing,
hawking, farming, gardening, &c for the
first; and sexual intercourse of various
modifications for the second. Or
intellectual, - as in tracing the phenomena
of the visible universe, and judging of
causes &c and applying them often to
promote the first class of objects. Or
moral, - as when we endeavour to improve
the condition or [insertion]seek the[/insertion] well being of our fellow

creatures; and in doing this refer to
an imaginary model, worshipping a
supreme power & intelligent cause, though
unknown, and feel a sublime kind of
moral sympathy in attributing to this
cause the exalted and more perfect qualities
of the human mind. In the beginning
of all pursuits, sympathy, or a desire of
obtaining the approbation, or respect or
admiration of our fellow men has the
greatest influence over the mind: Thus
we hunt, and fish, and shoot in society
and glory in success. At last however
the pursuit itself becomes abstracted;
and this is fortunate, for we learn how
selfish human nature is as we grow
older.
The miser knows that money is power
and that it represents almost all that
is sought for, desired, or envied, by

mankind; and he is perfectly happy
in increasing his latent power; yet
in reality, he is as absurd as the man
who should pass his life in accumulating
gunpowder, because it is the instrument
by which battles are won.
It appears to me that there are three
kinds of pursuits to which a powerful
mind to which a powerful mind may
be applied with certainty of obtaining
important and useful and perhaps splendid
results.
First: The perfection and application of
the [underline]differential calculus[/underline] to the refined
movements of the corpuscular or atomic
arrangements. Or, perhaps a new calculus
may be invented bearing the same relations
to the smallest possible powers or functions
of atoms that the differential calculus
bears to masses, and assignable quantities
both of time and motion.

There is this more important difference,
that all our elements and atoms are
unknown, and we are in the state of
those who begin to decypher a book

May it not be imagined that the

light the first envelope of the [misc]misc_346|Monads[/misc];
and may not my earliest hypothesis be
true?
What is true with respect to matter, will
probably with respect to spirit be absolutely
false; as supposing organization only the

[page]124|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00124|dnp21d120pp|92563489[/page]

Is there not a [misc]misc_346|monad[/misc], or one perceptive
atom or principle which plays as it were
round different arrangements in the brain
and which acts in its own little world
as the great diffusive [misc]misc_346|monad[/misc] does in the
universe; but how far beyond our power
the conception, how we are lost, and the
infinitely little of man and his thoughts

Men who have considered nature only
by what is visible, and who find in the
forms and energies of matter the generation
of thought, are like children, who may
consider the motion and action of a
Steam Engine as produced by the solid
matter; ignorant of the elements of fire
and water which are the immediate cause
of its activity, or of the physical discovery
of human intelligence by which the
combinations producing it were made.
What is the instinct of animals, but

Now even the rudest people are

[page]126|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00126|dnp21d122pp|92563492[/page]
special revelations are no longer necessary
It is quite certain, that in these revelations,
no new ideas were given, and no new
impressions received, even the supposed
presence of Deity was an imagination
of a human form, and the miracles
mere delusions of the human mind,
though clearly disposed to these delusions
by the existence of the instinct, and
this indeed is in accordance with
the Divine wisdom and power, as it
is much more easy for mind to produce
an ideal conviction of satisfied appetite
than to create a new quantity of matter,
which must have been the case if
sufficient to satisfy the multitude
in the wilderness had been produced
from the small loaves and fishes.

probably: for the same reason, it
may be a matter more susceptible

if man were but the sport of some

Political reflections Sep. 1816.
It would be easy to shew what
science has done, what she might do
for states men, and what states men
have lost by not employing philosophers
rather than empty headed declaimers
and empty pursed Cadets from the
Aristocracy.
Had there been a philosopher in the
P. C. [misc]misc_460|the expedition to Walcheren[/misc]
would not have been undertaken,
 It required a mind as much in a
fog as [person]person_918|Lord C[superscript]s[/superscript].[/person] not to know that
the fogs of that county were
pestilential at the season when the
expedition was undertaken. An old
 woman of a physician was made a
scape goat. Any philosopher

[page]134|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00134|dnp21d130pp|92563503[/page]
would have warned government
against the importation of corn,
which is now weighing down the
country by a diminished circulation
&c: A tax upon foreign corn would
have been preferred, not a maximum.
There would have been no notes and
no bankruptcies.
Any philosopher would have taught
government the uselessness of the present
coinage, and would have advised them
instead of buying bullion, by switching
paper to have taken 6 millions of paper
from the bank, as a proper bonus
for the immense sums levied by that
body upon the public. If coin
was wanting, they should have
obliged the bank to furnish it.

he could teach ministers, that a

The national debt, at least that
part of if incurred [deletion]by[/deletion][insertion]during[/insertion] the last war.
the greatest, the most astonishing part,
was principally employed in exciting
 industry and ingenuity at home. The
money employed as subsidies must
have been either raised ultimately from
the labour of the people of these islands
or from produce sent to these islands,
entered as a debt to be paid with interest

[page]136|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00136|dnp21d132pp|92563506[/page]
but the foreign fund holders are very
few, the debt then is principally due
 for the labour of the British. [place]place_121|England[/place]

therefore, the productive labour which
raised 500 millions must have been
enormous. The national debt called
forth all the energies of ingenuity &
 industry. The gold we sent abroad
was purchased by labour, and we
sent abroad an immense quantity
of produce, not of Corn or wine, but of

of our   our clays, our ores, and our
wool
I am sure there is gross ignorance

Revolutions
Every thing good in society has
arisen from gradual reform and
progressive change. When the leaves
of a tree are blighted it kills the
tree to pluck them off. Decayed
leaves are better than no leaves at
all. They should be suffered to perform
their imperfect functions till they are
thrown off by the vigour of young

The magnificence of a court as long
as funds can be found, and as long
as the money is entirely expended in
the country, is like brilliant sunshine
which in Spring and Summer raises

leaves to sprout, and the fruit to ripen,
but in Autumn when the plant no

To raise money in a Country, and
spend that money out of it, is like
carrying off corn crops from a soil:
it must soon become barren.
We hear the thunder; and unless we
examine into the cause of it, some
great catastrophe many take us
unawares. We must enquire whether
it is from the heavens or the earth;
whether if is caused by a tempest, which

it is the forerunner of a volcanic
eruption, which may deluge us with
burning lava, not with transient rain,
and destroy for ever are wealth, our
cities, & our palaces.

In endeavouring to sap the foundations

That there is great distress, and
great discontent in the Country, is
at present a truth universally admitted
Even those persons who are most disposed
to hope, and to see objects in sunshine
consider the present crisis not only
as replete with difficulty and danger,
but as leading to despair. There is
a cloud hanging over us, and persons
are as much divided in opinion with

[page]141|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00141|dnp21d137pp|92563513[/page]
137
respect to the causes as the consequences
of it. Some regard it merely a summer
cloud resulting from the sunshine of our
peace; others as a winter cloud depending
upon the chill of our taxation: some
expect it to be disrespected in a transient
shower: and others hail it as the fore-
-runner of a deluge which is to sweep
away our harvests and to destroy our
habitations. In such a season it is
natural to look to the government, not
only for information, but for comfort:
but the persons of the head of affairs
seem as little able to afford the one
as the other. They have indeed talked
about the inconvenience resulting from
a transition to peace from war, and
the impatient ignorance of the people
with regard to taxation: but such
opinions, vague, unsatisfactory, and insolent

[page]142|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00142|dnp21d138pp|92563515[/page]
do not dissipate doubts or awaken
 confidence. The peace they have given
us may indeed be represented by an
invented and empty cornucopia, and
the miserable are not likely to be
soothed by being accused of impatience.
To expect remedies from Physicians
who are ignorant of the nature of
the disease they undertake to cure
is absurd. Nature and a good
Constitution might conquer the malady
but it is not likely that natural means
will be allowed, and the constitution

patient under such circumstances is
right to find other physicians, or to
give up physic altogether.

Great proprietors and consumers

They consume in common years above

to labour by exciting excellence.
They keep the standard in the inventions
belonging to common life, and the
ruder arts as well as the more refined,
higher. Could we approach nearer
to an equality, the comforts i.e. the
general mass of them, in Society would
be diminished: the tendency of improvement
is to elevate together all the classes of
society. Revolutionary systems which
pretend to bring men nearer to an
equality may indeed bring them nearer
to a state of nature, but not to a state
of happiness. Unhappily Experience has
shewn, that its tendency is to make
men savages, not philosophers. It is
like a contagious and destructive fire

I know no better subject for an useful

himself: vice is exhibited in all [underline]its[/underline]
magnificence; and the luxurious repose
of the sensualist, is only diversified by the

hardly imagine any thing more fatal
to the exquisite sensibility, [deletion]of[/deletion] the amiable
modesty of English women, than that life
which brings them continually in contact
with vice and folly. I have been

In minds of great power, there is
usually a disposition to variety of
pursuits; and they often attempt all
branches of letters and science, and
even the imitative arts; but if they
become truly eminent, it is by devotion
to one object at a time, or at most
two objects. This sort of general power
is like a profusion of blossoms on a
fruit tree, a symptom of health and
strength; but if all are suffered to
become fruit, all are feeble and bad:
but when the greater portion is destroyed
by accident or art, the remainder, being
properly nourished; become good, large
and healthy. -

We have no idea of the creation of
living beings, for nothing analogous ever
occurs in the history of Nature, and
we see nothing except the successive
generations of living beings all [nonenglish]nonenglish_214|[underline]ab ovo[/underline][/nonenglish];
yet it is certain, that there was a period
when most of the existing generation did
not exist, and when races of animals
were in being that are now extinct.
In the former order of things, we find
a multitude of fishes, a few amphibians
birds and quadrupeds; but amongst the
remains of life, no marks of an intelligent
race of beings, that had altered the surface
of the globe in the way that man has done
Has such a race ever existed before Man? -
Probably not: - for some of his works would
have been destroyed with more difficulty
than the bones of fishes, or the skeletons of

[page]155|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00155|dnp21d151pp|92563533[/page]
151
birds. This can only be said of that
great change produced in the matter of
the globe by water, and which seems to
have preceded the present order of things.
A change produced by fire would have
destroyed every thing belonging to life,
even its organized forms, and would have
left in the place of beauty, order, and
intelligence, a mere chrystalline arrangement
the result of the chemical attractions of
 matter. That this was the state of the
globe which immediately preceeded the
first appearance of the animals, whose
remains exist in the aqueous formations,
there is every reason to conclude; and
that a destruction of the present order by
fire may take place, is within the range
of probabilities.
But can such be the disposition of things

[page]156|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00156|dnp21d152pp|92563534[/page]
that the greatest and highest intelligence
the results of the accumulated genius of
man operating through a long course
of ages, and at length attaining some-
-thing like perfection, should disappear
and all the results be lost. Surely
these results much attach to some
other system, which belongs to a moral
or intellectual scheme of things wholly
different from the physical, and which
coincides with the views belonging to
Revelation.
Or is even the highest perfection, and
aggregated power of the human mind
a mere nothing, compared with the
immensity of intellectual combinations
belonging to the universal mind, a
mere image in a dream, in relation
to the whole of the living and acting
universe

On all these subjects man is profoundly
ignorant; yet some processes analogous
to creation seem to have been recent.
[place]place_685|New Holland[/place] for instance, contains races
of animals found no where else on the
surface of the globe: and it is impossible
to believe, either that they have been there
from all eternity, or that they have been
carried there by man.

Religion. - Instinct.
With respect to my ideas of revelation
and instinct; - it is as easy for the Supreme
Intelligence to form a thinking being
such as a [person]person_036|Newton[/person], as a chrystal,
without the slow process of generation
of body or mind.

Moral excellencies and physical as well
as defects or diseases.

The [underline]quality[/underline], disease or virtue of
[underline]Inspiration[/underline], may be dormant in many

as is the case in animals with

[page]159|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00159|dnp21d155pp|92563539[/page]
155
instincts destroyed by domestication;
and in insanity, gout, &c which sleep
for three or four generations.
Is not the want of religious instinct in
the new Hollanders, a proof that they
are a distinct creation, as the Kangaroo
and [misc]misc_732|Ornithorinchus Paradoxicus[/misc].
One sees in all this why the Jews were
kept a pure people, and not permitted to
intermarry.
Men must [underline]image[/underline] or [underline]typify[/underline] the feelings
of religion, and the breathing of the Divine
Mind is still thrown upon sensible
objects, with which it cannot blend;
but which it merely sets in motion, -
like the pure air, which agitates [deletion]the[/deletion]
equally the muddy pool, the clear lake,
and the immense ocean, but is ever above

[page]160|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00160|dnp21d156pp|92563541[/page]
them, and unmingled with them;
it gives form to their waves, but does
not change their substance. So, inspiration
can be made known to men only through
terms connected with common life, and
popular ideas, and revelation must be
an impulse of thought, or a peculiar
association of ideas, and not a new
creation of thought.
Even in the Roman and Greek Mythology
there seem to have been some vestiges
or remains of this instinct.
Prophecy or inspiration limited to
particular purposes, not giving omniscience
and necessarily blended with the false
knowledge of the mind.
Glimmerings of Divine light seem often
to belong to the weakest intellects, and
to have been exhibited in recent times.

Much of doctrinal absurdity in the
freethinking or deistical school arises from
Anthropaganism, as their supposing the
Divine mind similar to the human:
but the largest and smallest [underline]finite[/underline]
quantities are alike compared with infinity;
and though there is a great difference
between the intelligence of a [person]person_036|Newton[/person] and an

[page]162|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00162|dnp21d158pp|92563543[/page]

there is [deletion]more[/deletion] [insertion]none[/insertion] when either of them is
compared with infinite wisdom. The
destruction of a world, and the crushing
of a gnat are alike insignificant when
considered with respect to infinity: and
to make infinite wisdom and goodness after
our models, is absurd; [deletion]as much[/deletion] more so
than to expect a preaching ant, or a writing
bee.
We must believe that whatever has been

 and has been for ever sentient but the
human intellect is by divine wisdom

 it may be [deletion]made[/deletion] [insertion]useful[/insertion] to guide [insertion]to[/insertion] the future:
but I have some idea, that conscience
is a habit of mind, resulting from a
previous state of existence.

laughed, suffered and enjoyed; but all
 this is forgotten by the man. The oblivion
of past being, does not however destroy
the consequences of its existence. The child
forgets the accident of a fall, but the limb
continues maimed. It will be no consolation
to know that future punishment will be
connected with an oblivion of the definite
cause of suffering.
It seems to be an axiom that what is

If we shew the existence of something

of sensation which it is impossible to
describe; it seemed as if I became
diffused in the atmosphere & had a
general sense of a balmy warmth: -
a sort of agreeable with my whole
body. Floating for a little while in this
atmosphere, I found that I had wings
& slowly & with some difficulty I rose
in the air & gradually ascending above
the cave or recess in which was the
red light, I found myself in the [deletion]clouds[/deletion]

of light. It seemed as if I was altogether
entering into a new state of existence

[page]184|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00184|dnp21d180pp|92563580[/page]
I for some time reposed upon the
brightest of these galaxies & saw as
it were in the immensity of space
systems of suns & worlds forming a
sort of abyss of light into which
I seemed doubtful whether I should
plunge. At this moment I seemed
in communication with some intelligent
 being to     I stated that I had
always been of opinion that the spirit
was eternal & in a state of progression
from one form of existence to another
more perfect, that I had just left
a world where all was dark & cold
& gross & heavy; that I now knew
what it was to have a purer & better
existence, but that I hoped for something
still more perfect; that I was now
in natural warmth & light & ether

& that I hoped to be ultimately in
a world of intellectual light where
the Causes of all things were developed
& where the sources of pleasure would
be unbounded knowledge.
After this my dream became
confused; my fields of light changed
to a sort of luminous wood filled
with paths & the bright vision
degenerated into a common dream.

is usual, but chiefly
as phenomena of mind,

By some persons, [deletion]there[/deletion] perhaps
this reverie & dream
may be considered, as
inventions, fictions the
creations of the imagination
for the purpose for which
they were introduced; - but
I cannot admit the
connectedness of such a
conclusion. - When reading
[otherwork]otherwork_045|the Dialogues[/otherwork] to him, I
remember venturing to
suggest his not explaining

that I now know what
it was to have a power

that I hoped for something
still more powerful; - that
I was now in natural
warmth & light & ether, -
& that I hoped to be
ultimately in a world

because it has some

detail. -
" In the first part of the

rather disagreeable as
well as I recollect. It
must have been considerably
after midnight, when I
imagined myself in a
place partially illuminated
with a reddish hazy
light; within, it was
dark & obscure, but
without & opening upon
the sky very bright.
I experienced a new kind

it right to mention that
I am too intense a believer

from which I think I have

manner in which they display

with this manner, that I have
chiefly to do at present.
They display him, as a Poet,
as a metaphysician, as a
geologist, as a Chemist &
as a Christian - & in each
the Philosopher - the Philosopher
in the original modest &
humble meaning of the word.
As such he began his career
as such he terminated it
& as such I trust [deletion]it[/deletion] [insertion]his name[/insertion] will
descend to posterity - [deletion]in[/deletion]

they were written, - & the time &
manner in which they were
concluded; from the deep
interest he expressed in them
himself when I read them to
him, during the height of his
illness & when he supposed
he had not many hours to
live; - from his having [deletion]en-[/deletion]
[deletion]trusted them to my care to[/deletion]
[deletion]publish[/deletion] bequeathed them to
me in his will, & entrusted
me with the publishing of
them, - from these circumstance
I am necessarily deeply in-

from their nature & tendency
as to doctrine & the

[page]276|MS-DAVY-12104-000-00276|dnp21d272pp|92563718[/page]
as the changes which take
place on the surface of our
globe from the action of
the various causes to which
material forms are exposed.
Such is a very slight outline
of this work, - which as his
own preface states, was com-
posed, during a period, of
bodily indisposition, & as I
have mentioned in a notice
prefixed, was concluded at
the moment of the invasion
of the last attack of illness
from which he never re-
covered. -
To me these Dialogues are
particularly interesting; from
the circumstances under which

a true chemical Philosopher
ought to be, - the qualities

quisite to form him,
the method of [unclear]proscribing[/unclear]
chemical science & the
spirit of philosophy in which
it should be pursued. -
