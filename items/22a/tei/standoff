            <note>A pupil of Socrates, much of Plato's large corpus of surviving philosophical texts are written in the form of Socratic dialogues. He espoused a philosophical idealism including the primacy of mathematics and an anti-democratic political philosophy because of the execution of Socrates. Plato's writings have been, and are, so influential that all subsequent philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato.</note>

            <note>Born in Massachusetts, he served in the British and Bavarian armies. Knighted by George III in 1787, the Elector of Bavaria created him Reichsgraf von Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire in 1792. His appointment in the late 1790s as Bavarian ambassador to London created a minor diplomatic incident, during which he helped establish and manage the Royal Institution, in the course of which he appointed Davy to lecture there. Later he married Lavoisier's widow and lived unhappily ever after. FRSL.</note>
