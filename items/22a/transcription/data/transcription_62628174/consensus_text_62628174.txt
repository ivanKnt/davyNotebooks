I shall now treat of a subject of some importance
& [insertion]as it is[/insertion] ultimately connected with the great laws of our
existence, dreaming. It has been little attended to
by metaphysicians, less by moralists & not at all
by historians -
Our waking existence is composed of impressions
+ ideas & feelings of different degrees of vividness
which suceed each other in what may
be called trains - The past is simple memory
the [deletion]present[/deletion] future is analogy - & the
| [underline]present[/underline] is made up of [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] impression sometimes
| tho rarely simple , but after mixed in
| associated with the past & future. -
X In dreams all the ideas occurring appear to
be of one degree of vividness , there is neither
past nor future no mixture of impression
with idea / the feelings occur as in waking
| though seldom connected with what may
| be called the secondary reflective feelings
| those produced when - an action at first
pleasant after a long space of time comes
to be considered as disgust. . -
The mixtures of memories & analogies
which are mingled in waking by the
peculiarly modifying & correcting impressions
in the order of nature, are here
called up , [deletion]only by[/deletion] & modified only
by slight organic feelings generally
