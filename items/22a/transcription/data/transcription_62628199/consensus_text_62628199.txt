 3. The late exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of D[superscript]r[/superscript] Herchels have deman[superscript]d[/superscript]
that radiant heat must [deletion]consist[/deletion] depend on
the motions of a peculiar etheral fluid; And
these motions may be either rectilineal
projections [deletion]or[/deletion] undulations.-
It has been lately supposed that they
are undulations And in this Theory it has
been assumed 1 that those separations of
the particles of bodies connected with their
states of sensible heat or free caloric - [deletion]may[/deletion]
[deletion]be[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] owing to [deletion]vibratory motions[/deletion] their vibrations
2 that those vibrations [insertion]may be [deletion]capable[/deletion] of being communicated from one kind of [unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] to the [unclear]xxxxxxxx xx[/unclear][/insertion] are capable of being
produced by & of producing undulations
[insertion]has undulations which are visible heat[/insertion] in the elastic [deletion]heat me[/deletion] etheral medium
4 that the elastic etherial medium is capable
of existing in different degrees of density
in different bodies. [deletion]A supposition which[/deletion]
[deletion]may account for the phaenomena of[/deletion]
[deletion]detonation deflagration &c which have herewith[/deletion]
[deletion]been equally perplex[/deletion] & that its states
of density are capable of being changed
during chemical combinations & decomp[superscript]s[/superscript]
These propositions are evidently commensurable
with the exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] of C[superscript]t[/superscript] Rumford & professor Pictet
on the heat produced by friction; they are
strengthened by the analogy between the phaen
omena of radiant heat & those of sound &
they in some measure reconcile the two
different Theories of heat
