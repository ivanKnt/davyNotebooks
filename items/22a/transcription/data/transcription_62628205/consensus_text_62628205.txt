analysis: than by the synthetical method.-
& consequently the laws of their formation
are more or less complicated. -
The general phaenomena can only be
understood by a minute examination
& application of the proposition in
the first choise. relating to the attraction
& which may be called the laws of
attraction - The force which bodies
 are separated is uniformly commensable
to the force with which they combine -
& as different bodies have different
affinities for each other in all
cases of decomposition; the strongest
body expels the weakest. but this
according to a certain law of its
bulk. - likewise in certain cases
bodies compounded mutually decompose
each other in consequent of reciprocal
affinities - This is called complex affinity
- The affinities of bodies are
known to a certain extent but the
relation of affinity to mass has been
studied but for a very short time -
All compositions are much influenced
by the changes of temperature taking place
at the moment they begin: this is a
source of error & of doubt - Thus sulphur
& silver have a greater tendency to combine
