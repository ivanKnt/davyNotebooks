[deletion]The [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] The substances [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] which form
the subject of contemplation in this division are said
to be compounded of compound & simple substances
because as far as we can trace their composition
& analysis. They are not produced by simple
primary attractions of simple substances for each
other but rather by attractions modified in
consequence of prior combinations. - - - 
They are extremely numerous & heretofore
have been very little studied - One class of them
inded which is the most simple though it
is far from being the most [deletion]compound[/deletion]
important we are tolerably well acquainted with
the neutral Salts; but the compounds which
are called animal & vegetable are very little
known - their composition is so varied
that it would be difficult to class
them by names denoting it & they may
with much propriety be considered under
the five classes of NeutroSaline compounds -
Mineral [deletion]substances[/deletion] compounds. - Animal
compounds & vegetable substances. -
The neutrosaline compounds are
all capable of being produced artificially
& certain of them are found with the
mineral compounds
