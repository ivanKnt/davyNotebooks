In considering the primary moving causes
of the universe we cannot but be struck by
the wonderful agency of the solar Light & heat
to the fact we not only owe the most numerous
& pleasurable of our sensations; but likewise wise our existence
for its action upon plants by which they are enabled
to preserve the purity of our atmosphere is great &
decided. To the solar heat is owing the vegetation
of plants; our comforts, the fluidity of water
in which our existence ultimately depend -
evaporation in summer; by which the air
is provided with moisture against winter
when it is precipitated for the fertilisation of
the earth - on which depends lightning &c-
In that the more we trace the agency of
these powers the more we are convinced of
their importance & utility in the great system
of nature.
