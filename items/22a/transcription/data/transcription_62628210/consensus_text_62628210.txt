which is not produced by heat is a mixed
process- - single decomposition double decomposition
decomposition of anamoly. - Heat & light produced
- Chrystalisation -
Bodies assume regular forms, all the different
forms may be referred to in a few simple
forms. - Connection of this with the corpuscular
philosophy. - Artificial arrangements [insertion]of particular parts of chemistry[/insertion]
- Part 2[superscript]d [/superscript]-
Heat light & electricity consider as the effects of
unknown agents.
1. Heat is produced in chemical
combinations & likewise by friction -
It is communicated in different ratios by different
bodies different bodies by receiving it have
different propensities to give it out. - [deletion]Fluids & gas[/deletion]
Bodies change their state & have no propensity
to give out the expansion they receive ; unless
they recover their state ie latent heat
, Fluids & gases communicate heat only by
carrying it solids communicate it in a different
manner. -
Of the general agency of heat, solution of
water in air by means of it , it action on
all slow chemical combinations &c -
- 2 Light
