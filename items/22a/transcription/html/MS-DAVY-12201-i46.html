         <h2><span class="person-surname">Plato</span></h2>
         
         
         
         <p>A pupil of Socrates, much of Plato's large corpus of surviving philosophical texts
            are written in the form of Socratic dialogues. He espoused a philosophical idealism
            including the primacy of mathematics and an anti-democratic political philosophy because
            of the execution of Socrates. Plato's writings have been, and are, so influential
            that all subsequent philosophy has been described as footnotes to Plato.</p>
