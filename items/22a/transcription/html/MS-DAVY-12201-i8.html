            as is evident from his recollections &amp;c there<br xml:id="">
            is every reason to beleive that sounds &amp;<br xml:id="">
            facts must have left behind them ideas<br xml:id="">
            in the womb, but farther there is every<br xml:id="">
            reason to suppose that an immense mass of<br xml:id="">
            tangible feeling must have been collected<br xml:id="">
            together during the formation of organs<br xml:id="">
            &amp; the muscles of the child acting upon the<br xml:id="">

            connected with pleasure or pain. -<br xml:id="">
            From the wonderful accounts that we have of the<br xml:id="">
            foetus being affected by the imagination of the<br xml:id="">
            mother, there is every reason to suppose that<br xml:id="">
            the feelings &amp; ideas an of the mother have<br xml:id="">
            some effect upon the child, She nourishes<br xml:id="">
