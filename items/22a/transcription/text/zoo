Division 1[superscript]st[/superscript]. of the Use of[/underline]
[underline]Words[/underline] -
What is Language? what is
the use of those collections of terms by
means and of which human beings are so
powerfully acted upon? How do articulate
sounds or visible signs produce by association
such an immense quantity of action &
feeling amongst men - Articulate sounds
derive all their power from association
they are capable in themselves of
producing but little pleasure, pleasurable
sounds are generally inarticulate - visible
signs only act from associations, in
themselves [deletion]nor[/deletion] they are neither pleasurable
or painful. - If we examine accurately
the progress of individual intellect we
shall find that all the sounds in
language originally expressed either ideas
impressions or feelings - But as some
individuals happened to modify their
words by accidental peculiarities of pronuncia

[page]6||dnp22a04pp|62628146[/page]
ation these words were used by the other beings
without standing for ideas; but happening
accidentally to be connected with feeling
they gradually became more & more firmly
cemented - How easily [deletion]([/deletion] Men by imitation
employ the words of others writing without seizing
at the same time their ideas is
evident from many of the terms of children.
for instance, What did your Godfathers
& Godmothers do for you? they promised
& vowed three things in my name. -
Words without meaning then have been constantly
accumulating in language not from this
cause alone but from various others. -
some men have invented words to stand
for causes & have connected much
feeling with them , Hence logopathy
other mean by forming abstractions
ie generalisations [deletion]have [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] to [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion]
in physical things, have had imitators
who have applied their reasonings to
intellectual things. or non entities, [deletion]a[/deletion]All
the books of logic & metaphysics in
the world prove this, all the discussions
concerning space identity, spirit, substance
[unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear] matter & an infinite variety
of other terms. - Hartley & Horne
Tooke have done something towards
clearing the way towards [deletion]making[/deletion] destroying
some of the idols of language;- but the
they gradually became more & more firmly

greater part of them are still worshipped. -
I hope in the following pages to throw some
[deletion]insight[/deletion] light upon language. [deletion]& t[/deletion]The science
of the human mind or the existence is in
fact nothing more than the formation
of an intelligible language, , in which
a simple history of the [deletion]formation[/deletion] [insertion]existence[/insertion] & [insertion]arrangement[/insertion] 
[deletion]quantity[/deletion] of impressions [deletion]of[/deletion], ideas & feelings
is communicated. - & the analytical
method is that method which teaches
us to use no terms that do not stand
for some impressions ideas or feelings. -
II [underline]Concerning Innate[/underline]
[underline]ideas.-[/underline]
If by innate ideas be meant ideas existing
in the mind of the infant before birth
[deletion]both[/deletion] the strongest of all analogies would induce us
to believe that they do not exist, nothing can
be more ridiculous than to suppose
that the mind of the infant is a tabula
rasa. - The sense of feeling must have
been exercised to a great extent,
probably those of taste & smell. & as
the infant is circumvolved by a fluid
fit for communicating vibrations consequently
[deletion]the child[/deletion] He must have heard a variety
of sounds and as his organisation is similar
in the womb & the moment He is evolved
from it & as impressions leave behind
communicating vibrations
as
of all analogies would induce

[page]8||dnp22a06pp|62628148[/page]
them ideas immediately after the infant is born
as is evident from his recollections &c there
is every reason to beleive that sounds &
facts must have left behind them ideas
in the womb, but farther there is every
reason to suppose that an immense mass of
tangible feeling must have been collected
together during the formation of organs
& the muscles of the child acting upon the
nerves & the nerves acting upon each
other & the arteries & veins giving new
impulses to them must have occasioned
an immense mass of ideas of touch to exist
in the mind. - More over we find
the production of hurts in adults connected
with titillations & other pleasurable & painful
feelings. Hence there is every reason to suppose
that the formation of organs must be
connected with pleasure or pain. - 
From the wonderful accounts that we have of the
foetus being affected by the imagination of the
mother, there is every reason to suppose that
the feelings & ideas an of the mother have
some effect upon the child, She nourishes
him, He is fed by her blood, He
is connected to her by nerves & muscles.

Her health must influence his -

for instance, a man is said to have an
innate idea of God of truth &c -
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Locke has proved that these terms
have never occurred to the Child
when He meant to prove that the
child had not the ideas connected
with them. Of language as the medium
of awakening ideas & feelings, in the
womb a Child can have no knowledge
of course He can have no innate
theoretical or practical principles. - What
are called reasonings moral truths &
self evident prepositions are neither more
or less than collections of general terms
standing for other terms which themselves
stand for ideas - If however a
child is capable of hearing external
noises in the womb. He may probably
have some collections of ideal terms
in his mind before birth _ They
can however have no [underline]accurate[/underline] meanings -
they may have meaning because they may be
associated with other ideas. -
means of language. Hence
We recollect only by means of language. . Hence
 it is that all the early [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] tangible
ideas are lost, like however - the first
feelings & visible images of infancy, they
are not unimportant they have acted
their part in the phaenomena of intellect
standing for other terms which themselves

that there exist in the mind a great variety
of tangible ideas is evident from the immense
quantity of motions many of them apparently
voluntary that are displayed by the
child immediately after birth, there motions
as appears from all analogies could have
been produced only by tangible impression.-

motions.-. [Ink Sketch of pyramid]

The Child at birth becomes consious of a
new class of perceptions visible imagery. -
He may be considered as a collection
of tangible impressions possessed of a
different affinities [overwritten]affinity[/overwritten] for audible impressions
&c &c . peculiar habits of association
ie of affinity must be given to him
in the womb. & [deletion]from[/deletion] upon these habits the
growth & devellopement of intellect must in
some measure depend. Hence perhaps the
proposition of Helvetius concerning the effect
of education is in a great measure ill founded
Sensibility is that peculiar habit in
the base of intellect, by which it combines
readily with great , quantities of pleasure
& pain. . - The conscious being [deletion]per[/deletion] that
being which is supposed to perceive & which

in common language is called the mind is
perhaps that collection of various tangible
impressions which arise from the connections of
the organic [deletion]matter of[/deletion] particles of the body
& of the actions which are constantly
taking place between them. - That perhaps is
the indefinable something, with which the tangible
impressions of organs considered as masses on
each other & on other bodies combine
or coalesce, the child sees & feels its
own organs connected more or less with
all its other perceptions, hence they
become the centre of his existence
they are the bases of the agregrate
of life. - The great tangible feeling
probably exists always, whereas the visible
& even the tangible impressions of
organs are often lost. - This tangible
I in dreams is connected with the
visible ideas of organs & is in
waking with their visible impressions. -
It is a whole composed of an
infinite variety of parts possessed

This tangible self is the cause of muscular

[underline]Of the origin of our Knowledge[/underline]
Knowledge in its most extensive [deletion]signification[/deletion] [insertion]meaning[/inserton] would
signify every thing that the human mind has been
conscious of or is capable of perceiving & in this
sense beings possessed of no articulate language
& of no arbitrary intelligible signs may be said
to have knowledge. [deletion]They[/deletion] Such [insertion]beings[/insertion] beings are indeed in
Each [superscript]being[/superscript] are indeed in
common language supposed capable of recollections
of volitions & of judgments - These they possess
in common with articulately speaking men.
& the origin of this first & simplest kind
of knowledge it will be well to investigate
before we enter upon the more complex
& more difficultly explicable phaenomena of
Knowledge by means of Language [sketches of fish]
That life is constituted by a series of impressions
[Two ink sketches of fish run vertically along the margin on this and next five lines] & of ideas of [deletion]fe[/deletion] feelings & of passions requires
no proof if our language is understood
this must be admitted as fundamental
that impressions precede ideas is likewise evident
That those impressions which are identical [deletion]to[/deletion] with
ideas [deletion]likewise modify them[/deletion] owe their identity to
their modification by them has been made evident
by reasonings in the preceding chapters. -

The fundamental proposition on which our

All that we can hope for in physical & metaphysical
science ie the science of nature & man is the discovery
of new facts & of new expressions of old facts.
By means of our immensely powerful instrument of
language we are capable not only of reasoning
upon known & common things but likewise by
making use of analogies & the analytical
method of reasoning upon unknown things the
data being known things - it is from the
extension of this reasoning to two great an extent

supposing modification of ideas a
thing, which must be certainly take place
I found a difficulty in explaining how
complex ideas ie ideas left by
false impressions or modifications of
perceptions do not exist in the mind
but this is easily explained by supposing
that the affinity of identity, ie the
affinity of real impressions for real ideas
in general destroys this; but in
some minds indeed it exists for
ever -
In dreams the idea of self has been

of [underline]the nature of light[/underline]

is obtained - It is likewise evolved

are more or less complicated. -
The general phaenomena can only be
understood by a minute examination
& application of the proposition in
the first choise. relating to the attraction
& which may be called the laws of
attraction - The force which bodies
 are separated is uniformly commensable
to the force with which they combine -
& as different bodies have different
affinities for each other in all
cases of decomposition; the strongest
body expels the weakest. but this
according to a certain law of its
bulk. - likewise in certain cases
bodies compounded mutually decompose
each other in consequent of reciprocal
affinities - This is called complex affinity
- The affinities of bodies are
known to a certain extent but the
relation of affinity to mass has been
studied but for a very short time -
All compositions are much influenced
by the changes of temperature taking place
at the moment they begin: this is a
source of error & of doubt - Thus sulphur
& silver have a greater tendency to combine

In considering the primary moving causes
of the universe we cannot but be struck by
the wonderful agency of the solar Light & heat
to the fact we not only owe the most numerous
& pleasurable of our sensations; but likewise wise our existence
for its action upon plants by which they are enabled
to preserve the purity of our atmosphere is great &
decided. To the solar heat is owing the vegetation
of plants; our comforts, the fluidity of water
in which our existence ultimately depend -
evaporation in summer; by which the air
is provided with moisture against winter
when it is precipitated for the fertilisation of
the earth - on which depends lightning &c-
In that the more we trace the agency of
these powers the more we are convinced of
their importance & utility in the great system
of nature.
