[Horizontal rule]
Let attempts be made to prevent
the solution of sulphure from oxidating &
see what follows then (if galvanic
appearances should be produced under
[underline]all the other circumstances). -[/underline]
Qu[unclear]i[/unclear] may not the galvanic habitudes of
metals be altered by making the nonoxidable
common exciter oxidate, thus let a circuit
be composed of iron Zinc | sulphur sol[superscript]n[/superscript] / water or

acid & muscular fibre
or silver & charcoal
or any other[deletion]s[/deletion] metals. -

Sulphure of lime may be easily made
[underline]certainly cakes of this may be molded tomorrow[/underline]
