The sulphurs exp[superscript]t[/superscript] just detailed was the same
when a strong solution was used as when
a weak one -
And this when the solution of sulphure
was [deletion]xxxx[/deletion] covered over with tallow
so as to be out of the contact
of the atmosphere. ( I used tallow
because oil is insufficient ; vid ;
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on green oxides of iron &
on the air pump .) yea even after
it was covered for some time [insertion]half an hour[/insertion] with
tallow & perfectly excluded from
the free air it must however be remembered
that, the water in the little connecting
tube was in contact with the air . .
it continued to act with equal vividness
[underline]for near an half hour. -[/underline]
The Silver [insertion]wire[/insertion] was now inclosed in solution
[underline]of sulphure; the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was indecisive -[/underline]
After more than 15 hours the Zinc
acted under solution of Sulphure of
[underline]potash -[/underline]
