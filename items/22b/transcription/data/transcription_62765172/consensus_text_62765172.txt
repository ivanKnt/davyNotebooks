~ Observations on Galvanism. .
~ particularly on Animal Galvanism ~
- In two papers published in M[superscript]r[/superscript] Nicholsons
philosophical Journal I have adduced numerous facts
all of which concur in proving that the Electrical
effects produced by the galvanic battery
or series of Volta & all other similar series
owe their primary excitement to the
oxidation of certain of the metallic plates.
But the galvanic series of Volta may be
considered as an assemblage of single
galvanic circles in which metallic plates
possessed of different powers for conducting
electricity are immediately in contact
in one point & mediately in contact
in other points [deletion]by[/deletion] through water & similarly
arranged galvanic plates. Consequently
in the analysis of the galvanic pile we
must endeavor to consider each circle
its action & electrical powers -
Before the wonderful discoveries of Volta

Galvani[deletion]c[/deletion] Ritter &c had proved that
