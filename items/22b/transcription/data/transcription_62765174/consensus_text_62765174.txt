[deletion]In July 1799 I accidentally discovered in making[/deletion]
[deletion]the experiment on the illumination of phosphorus[/deletion]
[deletion]beneath the surface of water by means of Sulphuric[/deletion]
[deletion]acid & oxygenated muriate of Potash[/deletion]
When highly concentrated sulphuric acid is poured
upon [insertion]about 1/100 of its weight[/insertion] oxygenated muriate of potash it immediately
assumes a deep orange red color [deletion][/deletion] at
its points of contact with the salt & as
the salt becomes dissolved this color is
diffused through it, [deletion]if[/deletion] during the
process little or no gas is given out ~
If after the acid is thus altered
in its properties oxyd muriate is introduced
into it gas is given out with rapidity
which proves that the alteration
of the properties of the acid is
perfect. - The deep orange colored
compound thus formed is combinable
with water in the same way as
common sulphuric acid with the
production of much heat & no
more gas is liberated than might
have owed its origin to the common
