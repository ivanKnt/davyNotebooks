The other tube should be exposed to
light [deletion]& a scale[/deletion] it scale should
form the medium of connexion
between them & the difference
between the number of degrees
marked by the two fluids should
be considered as the increment of
heat from light - The following
sketch will give some idea of the nature
of the [deletion]machine[/deletion] instrument.
This instrument would be perfect
supposing that at [deletion]low tem[/deletion] different
temperatures the measure of expansion
from [insertion]equal quantities[/insertion] light would be always
equal; [deletion]but at low temperatures[/deletion]
but supposing the common laws of heat
to apply to the case ; it will follow
that the heat produced by light will
be conducted off more rapidly in
proportion as the temperature is
low. - & that the degree at which
the highest quantity of light is
marked will be low in proportion
as the circumambient bodies are colder. -
