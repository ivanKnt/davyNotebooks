1 The men interested in the progress of physical science & to
such only is this memoir addressed cannot be
ignorant of the invention of the galvanic battery
& of the singular chemical changes that have
been effected by its agency. - They likewise
cannot be ignorant of the analogy
between its [insertion]composition[/insertion] effects & that of the
galvanic [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] arcs of Sulker, Galvani Ash.
Humboldt Ritter &c. It is not my design
to pursue this analogy or [deletion]to mark[/deletion]
[deletion]it distinctly, that the following[/deletion]
 [deletion]paragraphs may be clearly conceived[/deletion] [the text is underlined but, in the context of the page, must have been intended to be deleted]
[deletion]it is however necessary to state[/deletion]
[deletion]that single [insertion]simple[/insertion] galvanic circuits or arcs[/deletion]
[deletion]are constituted when two metallic[/deletion]
[deletion][insertion]one piece of metal[/insertion] charcoal or metals are [insertion]is[/insertion] in contact[/deletion]
[deletion]in [unclear]two[/unclear] point & connected in other[/deletion]
[deletion]points by means [insertion]with[/insertion]of organic matters[/deletion]
[deletion]or fluid [insertion]non metallic[/insertion] conductors of electricity[/deletion]
& to endeavour to ascertain
some of the relations of galvanism
to organic action. -
