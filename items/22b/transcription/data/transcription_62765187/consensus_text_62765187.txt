[Ink sketch]
I To ascertain the peculiar phaenomena exibited by
single galvanic arcs [deletion]in contact with water holding in[/deletion]
composed of two metallic bodies of different
degrees of oxydability & water holding in solution
Atmospheric air I cemented into a conical glass
tube a triangular piece of polished Zinc in
such a manner that 9/10 of the surface
of the metal was within the tube; [deletion]whilst[/deletion]
the apex of the triangle the point at
which it was cemented to the tube protruded
into the atmosphere. - R[superscript]ound[/superscript] this apex a piece
of silver wire was twirled & the extremity
of it introduced [insertion]far[/insertion] into another small tube
[deletion]open[/deletion] & cemented in it so as to leave only
one opening; both these tubes were filled
with water holding in a solution a
very little sulphate of magnesia & inverted
in a cup [deletion]of water[/deletion] containing the
same fluid. - so that a perfect galvanic
circuit was formed in close vessels. -
This app[superscript]s[/superscript] was set up on Nov[superscript]r[/superscript] 9[superscript]th[/superscript]
& suffered to rest till Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] 1[superscript]st[/superscript] -
During the first two days but little alteration
