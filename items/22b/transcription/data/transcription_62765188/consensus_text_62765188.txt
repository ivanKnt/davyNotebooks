but no gas had collected in either
of the tubes the silver became incrusted
at its point with a little whiteish
matter. -
At the conclusion of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] no gas had

sulphate of magnesia. - It was
soluble with effervescence & without cloudiness
in muriatic acid. -
From this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it appeared probable that
oxygene had been fixed on the Zinc of this
circle whilst hydrogene had been protruded
on the silver & had combined with
atmospheric air to form ammoniac. -
