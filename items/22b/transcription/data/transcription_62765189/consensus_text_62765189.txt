holding in solution a little red cabbage
juice; in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. no crust was

the Zinc oxidated with great rapidity
the color of the cabbage juice
These facts seemed to prove with
sufficient distinctness that ammoniac
was formed on the silver & oxide of
Zinc on the Zinc.
That this formation is primarily
owing to the oxidation of the Zinc
I mentioned as probable in a former
paper. - In endeavoring to ascertain
whether primary oxidation was essential
to the increased action of single circles
I exposed single galvanic circles consisting
of a Zinc plate & a silver plate
moistened at their points of contact with
water in the exhausted receiver
I could never wholly prevent the
oxidation from taking place though
it went on very slowly. -
