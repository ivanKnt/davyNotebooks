In boiled water it was not perceptible.
It ought to be remembered that the
metallic influence is never exerted
unless both the metals are in contact
with each other & the same quantity
of water thus if a plate of
dry silver be laid on a plate of
dry Zinc [insertion]& the [deletion]silver[/deletion] or zinc alone[/insertion] little effect will follow.
but if the metals are in contact
with each other & both in contact
with the same drop of water &c.
- We have no positive proof
that the first change of electricity
is produced from the oxydation
evaporation or even a change of
temperature in the surrounding at
mosphere may generate; but the
facts compared with those of
batterical galvanism are strongly
in favor of the oxidation being the
most powerful primary exciter. -
It seems that no galvanic action is
produced unless [underline]simple[/underline] changes are first
occasioned. -
