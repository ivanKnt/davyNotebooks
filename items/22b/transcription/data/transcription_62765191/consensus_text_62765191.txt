II But supposing that the modifications effected
in inorganic bodies by galvanism are owing
to the primary excitement of this Galvanism
from chemical changes; it does not follow
that the Galvanic signs produced by
metals in organic bodies must likewise
depend upon the oxydation of the metals
it is easy to conceive that different
~ [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Steele[/deletion] - charges of electrical matter
pre-existing in living animals may
be conducted away in different
ratios and & this seemed confirmed
by the phaenomena of excitation
by single metals or by [unclear]rubbed[/unclear]
metals. The phaenomena of taste
are those which Fabbroni has principally
insisted to depend upon metallic
oxydation & before I began to exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
I had no doubt but that his
opinion was right. I conjectured that
the fixation of oxygene upon the Zinc
& the formation of ammoniac upon
the silver must occasion the phaenomena
