discovery of new instruments of investigation
is one of the most necessary phaenomena -
The perfection of the physical sciences are
petually presenting us with new instruments
of investigation & as long as our analogies
between physical & chemical effects are
pursued only beyond a sertain extent -
Such were the reflections which occurred to
me whilst I was enquiring into the
relations of a singular series of physical
facts to the laws of life. -
1 The history of the galvanic pile or
Battery of Volta & its chemical & electrical
agencies cannot be new to the men
interested in the progress of physical science.-

in inorganic bodies primarily depend on
the oxidation of the metal.-
