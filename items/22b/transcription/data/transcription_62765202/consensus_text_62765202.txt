arcs of Galvani Ash Ritter &c [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] & the
combination of Volta.-
But these arcs have as yet displayed
no electrical agencies, their powers have
been limited to effecting certain slow

When two metals of different degrees

with each other are [insertion]both[/insertion] placed in
contact with water holding in solution
atmospheric air or other oxygenated bodies
provided one of them is capable of
oxidation independent of the other
it will oxidate more rapidly than

Such is the [deletion]galvanic[/deletion] [insertion]-oxydating[/insertion] arc of Ash. -
