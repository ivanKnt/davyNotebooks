3. The analogy between the composition

oxydation particularly when we consider
the experiments of Fabbroni - It would
appear that metallic substances were
incapable of effecting any changes
in inorganic bodies together unless
they were capable of effecting
them singly [insertion]indeed[/insertion] Supposing galvanism
& electricity exactly alike it would
follow that the peculiar states of
electricity which enabled metals
to act in a particular way
