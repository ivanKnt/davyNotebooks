upon water might be produced
by other [deletion]agents than agents change[/deletion]
causes changing their states of
electricity than simple oxidation.-
I have made many exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] with a view
to ascertain whether two metals [deletion]were[/deletion][insertion]are[/insertion]
capable of effecting changes, Silver & Zinc
in contact with water as free from
air as it can be made seem
to undergo no change. -
Silver & Zinc under water. -
I shall not in this place pretend to discuss the
question whether the galvanic influence is identical
with the electrical influence [insertion]the discriminating philosopher will find sufficient difference between them This is a question of theory[/insertion] ie whether the
spark & the signs of attraction & repulsion
are sufficient to induce us to class them
as a single series of phaenomena.
Nothing can be more evident than that
all the chemical changes & divers agencies that [insertion]insoluble[/insertion] light
displayed by the pile of Volta ultimately depend
upon primary chemical changes & the
most important of these changes is metallic
oxidation.-
The analogy between the [deletion]action[/deletion] [insertion]composition [/insertion]of the Voltaen
