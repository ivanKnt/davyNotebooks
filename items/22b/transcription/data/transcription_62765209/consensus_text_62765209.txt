& others in vessels filled with common
water. In the one case the
metals were scarcely at all tarnished [superscript][unclear][deletion]x[/deletion][/unclear][/superscript]- -
in the other they were oxidated -
. It is worthy of remark that
Zinc & silver oxidate much more
slowly when they are at the bottom
of water saturated with common air
None of the metals except those
which are capable of oxidating themselves
from the decomposition of water
at common temperatures are
capable of oxidating themselves in contact
with water holding in solution atmospheric
air -
. Zinc during or after its amalgamation
with mercury appears capable of decomposing
pure water exp[superscript]t[/superscript] in proof of this... -
I have attempted to ascertain
whether acids are decomposed more
rapidly when it contact with of
two [insertion]nearly equal[/insertion] drops of muriatic acid
Citizen de la Metherie long ago made some curious
observations on the non oxydability of iron -
