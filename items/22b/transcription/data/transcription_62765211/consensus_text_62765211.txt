whilst polished iron apparently effects no
alteration in it the rust may
depend upon the water deposited upon it
from variation of temperature -
[Horizontal rule]
2. All these facts compared [insertion]with those of [unclear]Ash[/unclear][/insertion] go far

contact with water unless these

I have before attempted to prove that
when a compound galvanic circle
is formed with Zinc & iron the Zinc
