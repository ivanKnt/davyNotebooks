1st The attempts heretofore made to explain the processes
of life by the supposition of their dependence
upon certain changes analogous to those taking
place in dead matter known by the names
of electrical & chemical appearances have been
vain & unsuccessful. - We are unacquainted with
The Nature of those changes taking place
in organic matter which constitute the
process of life [deletion]is unknown to us[/deletion]
[Ink box sketched around text below]
When the objects of our researches are [insertion]unknown[/insertion] properties

[insertion]in discovering [unclear]nitrogous[/unclear] capable of rendering sensible these properties[/insertion] use of in these Researches is analogy
Not that analogy [insertion]which[/insertion] existing in language
only induces us to class the terms
standing for unknown things in a
similar order to those standing for
known things.
