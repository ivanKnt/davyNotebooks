exp[superscript]t[/superscript]on on the galvanic decomposition of
water we will take two small tubes
[Ink sketch of apparatus]
& by boring a hole in the
bottom of them we shall
be able to ascertain what quantity
of gravitating matter each of them
will produce in several
expts the oxygene tube produced
rust.
[Ink sketch of apparatus]
1. The Galvanic pile of Volta does
not act unless the [deletion][unclear]internal[/unclear][/deletion] fluid
conducting media are capable
of oxydating the Zinc. -
2. In proportion as the conducting
media are capable of more
rapidly oxidating the Zinc to a
certain extent & in a certain ratio
the galvanic phaenomena proceed more
rapidly.
