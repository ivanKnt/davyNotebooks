The first observer who examined the
changes produced in water [deletion]by[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]the[/deletion] in[/insertion] Contact
with different metals was D[superscript]r[/superscript] Ash.
In a letter quoted by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Humboldt
He asserts that if silver be laid upon
moistured Zinc the Zinc will become
rapidly oxidated & that an analogous
action takes place when lead & quicksilver
or iron & copper are employed. -
His experiments were [insertion]successfully[/insertion] repeated by [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript][/deletion] Humboldt
& Ritter & the last of these philosophers
found that [deletion]provided[/deletion] [insertion]one point of contact between[/insertion] the metals
[deletion]were in contact[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]with each other[/deletion][/insertion] in one
[deletion]point[/deletion] was sufficient to this
effect. [insertion]provided they were both in contact in other parts with water[/insertion] He also noticed that
Zinc with molybdena [insertion]or[/insertion] bismuth or [insertion]with water[/insertion]
copper & tin with silver & molybdena
& lead with silver produced
similar effects.
On what do these appearances
depend [insertion]they are analagous to those produced[/insertion] [deletion]the composition[/deletion] of the combinations
[deletion]producing them is[/deletion] [insertion]likely[/insertion] [deletion]highly analogous[/deletion]
[deletion]to that of the pile of Volta. -[/deletion]
