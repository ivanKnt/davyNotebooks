The analogy between the composition [insertion]of the pile of Volta[/insertion] & [insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]action[/deletion]

I have found that all the substances
[insertion]capable of[/insertion] actions in the galvanic pile are
likewise capable of acting [insertion]in these combinations[/insertion] as single
oxydating circles Zinc & charcoal
produce similar effects to Zinc &
silver. Likewise Zinc & iron & iron

[insertion]that when they are not immediately connected the same[/insertion]
This analogy as well as the same
general gross [deletion]analogy[/deletion] [insertion]resemblance[/insertion] between the
chemical appearances exhibited would
induce us to beleive that the
agencies of the Voltan pile & the
circle of Ash were produced from
not independent
similar causes. There are many 
facts which demonstrate that
