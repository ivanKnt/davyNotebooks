From several exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] it appears probable
that when acids are made to
act upon metals this action is
increased by metallic contact
I [deletion]found[/deletion] have several times
dropped on polished plates of Zinc
one in contact with silver
& the other isolated equal quantity
of muriatic & Nitrous acid in all
cases where the acid was connected
[deletion]by[/deletion] with the two metals by means
of [deletion]a fluid [unclear]or[/unclear][/deletion] water it appeared
to be saturated more rapidly. -

in the single galvanic circle [deletion]seems[/deletion]
is [deletion][unclear]are[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]probably so[/insertion][deletion]are[/deletion] so modified [deletion]by[/deletion] by the contact
of the other metal that as in
the [deletion]compound[/deletion] series of Volta
oxygene is [deletion]fixe[/deletion] fixed on one
metal whilst hydrogene is produced
on the other -
My exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] afford probabilities in
favor of this: but they do not
