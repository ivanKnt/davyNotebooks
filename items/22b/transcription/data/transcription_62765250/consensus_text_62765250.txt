[Horizontal rule]
Supposing that water is an
elementary body it follows that
in the galvanic decomposition of water
an influence is generated [deletion]which by passing[/deletion]
[deletion]to the next[/deletion] by the oxydation of the
zinc which passing through the water
+ or the metal is capable of becoming
hydrogene by combining with a fresh portion
of water that during this combination
it gives to the water a [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] habitude
to combine with the metal again
which produces a similar effect & so
on
In single galvanic circles the metals
are immediately in contact with each other
& both connected with the same water
[Horizontal rule]
The shock & power to decompose water
x do not diminish in Vacuo exactly
in the same ratio
