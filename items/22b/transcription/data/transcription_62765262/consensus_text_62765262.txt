142 white fumes but no ascertainable
precipitation of charcoal - after
absorbtion of carbonic acid stood at

These gave with 20 of Nitr[superscript]o[/superscript] gas
a diminution hardly percep

[Horizontal rule]
60 of N.O. with 20 of
hydro - filled a space after
detonation equal to 125.
no charcoal was precipitated &
in the addition of caustic potash it
diminished to about [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] 110. -

of course the new hydrocarbonate
formed must have been about 12
