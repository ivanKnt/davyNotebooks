filled a space equal to 110 ~
with lime water gave a very
faint precipitate but the absorption
- could not have equalled three.
- These 110 with 60 NO diminis
hed to 135 & with potash to 105
- These did not inflame with
20 of NO nor when 20 of
oxygene were added ~
no prussic acid
[Horizontal rule]
100 of N.O. with 20
hy[superscript]e[/superscript]. stood at 138 - after
detonation - no precipitation
diminished with lime watr
& with potash to 110. the lime
water became precipitated -
did not detonate with 10
of oxygene - & no prussic
acid apparently -
[Horizontal rule]
120 NO with 20 hy[superscript]e[/superscript] diminished
by detonation to 120 - !!!
On the addition of potash
the diminution was to rather less
than 90 ~ Nitr[superscript]e[/superscript] of silver produced
no precipitation - 2 was not some [unclear]xxx xxx[/unclear] shewn
