Jan[superscript]y[/superscript]. 31. made the exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
on the transition of Carbonate

~ heated white -
. No prussic acid formed -
the fluid that came over
was pellucid; & appeared
to be a solution of alkaline
Carbonate of Ammoniac -
- The tube was very
~ little blackened on the inside -
60 measures of the gas
with 60 of oxygene diminished
to about 85 & on the
introduction of potash to
rather less than - 70 - 70 -
[Horizontal rule]
80 of the [deletion]second[/deletion] [insertion]1st[/insertion] with 60 of
oxygene filled 100 - more
than 20 were fixed air
[Horizontal rule]
When Sulp[superscript]d[/superscript] H from metals is fixed with NO
no sensible precipitate is perceived but the cylinder
filled with white fumes - probably a little
sulphur is precipitated in that from alkalies
