filled with very weak solution of Nitrous
acid, the other with very weak
solution of sulphure of potash. -
it gave gas to the gold & platine
wires-  the side of the suplhure

became incrusted with a white [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear]
substance which was apparently carbonate
of lime . as it effervesced with sulphuric
acid & gave with it a white precipitate
which was re disolved in the excess
of acid. -
