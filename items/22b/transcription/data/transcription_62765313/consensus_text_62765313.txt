Having found [deletion]in my a[/deletion] during my enquiries,
concerning the different modes of production
of galvanism during the oxydation of
metallic bodies that nothing more
was required for the formation of
a galvanic series than that a
number of [deletion]arcs[/deletion] arcs composed of
two metals of different degrees
of oxidability should be in contact
in alternate points with fluids
capable [insertion]under such circumstances[/insertion] of giving oxygene to one only
of them it occurred to me that
it was a general law of galvanism
