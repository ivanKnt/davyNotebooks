[unclear]xx[/unclear] That action analogous to the
galvanic exists in organised nature is
evident from the phaenomenon of
the torpedo but what we know
concerning the galvanic or electrical
organ of that animal will not
enable us to affirm that the
nerves & muscles of animals
we their powers to any arrange
ment like the galvanic series. -
The contemplation of the most
simple phaenomenon of galvanism
authorise us to suppose that
they depend upon chemical changes
& we are certain that chemical
 changes are perpetually going on
in the human body & that
many of its functions depend
upon those changes. the new
equilibriums of electricity produced
in the living organs must necess
arily be possessed of a considerable
influence on their functions
but it is more than probable
