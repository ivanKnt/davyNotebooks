& heating the lower sol[superscript]n[/superscript] which would
perhaps require many degrees before it
would become of the same specific gravity
as the 2[superscript]d[/superscript]. queri would it heat
it or would it retain all its
own heat till it became lighter
than the sol[superscript]n[/superscript] above it & then
ascend through it this would prove
whether or no fluids conducted heat
upwards - The [unclear]x[/unclear][superscript]ts[/superscript] exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] prove
that they do not conduct it
downwards the apparatus might
be contrived in this way. -
let a wire [deletion]at[/deletion] be confined in
a [deletion]cap[/deletion] capilary tube & hermetically
sealed in it let there be three
thermometers.
