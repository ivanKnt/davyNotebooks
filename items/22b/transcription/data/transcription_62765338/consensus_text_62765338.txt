a similar effect. M[superscript]r[/superscript] Proust
thinks that with the oxide of
Zinc both Gallic acid & Tannin
is decomposed ; but I have found
them both in the solution made
with Muriatic acid.-
- When Carbonate of Potash is
poured into solution of Galls a dense
precipitate falls down which M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Proust supposes to be Tannin separates
from its solution by means of the

it by the Salt. - In examining
this precipitate I have not been

proportions of the alkali & the
solution have been used.-
- The precipitate from solution of
Galls is very little soluble in
