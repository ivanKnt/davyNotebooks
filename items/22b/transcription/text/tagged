Sulphure of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] appears to be a good conductor
of [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] influence; it appeared when connected
with silver water the tongue to produce
[person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] excitement, thus -
Could not a pile be easily erected with
Silver Sulphure of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] & Muscular fibre?
or with [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] Sulphure & muscle . ?
It ought to be remembered that the sulphure
used to day was mixed with a little [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical] -
The leg of a frog contracted when the
muscle was brought in contact with Solution
of sulphure of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] standing on a plate
of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] that had just been heated, the
nerve being in contact with silver in
contact with the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]. [nonenglish]nonenglish_009|Qu[/nonenglish] was the
cause of this animal Elect[superscript]y[/superscript]. or oxidation
of the Sulphure, or oxidation of
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] from the water on the edge
of the drop where the sulphure had
been decomposed -
The tongue appeared to be affected when
this [unclear]circ[/unclear] was produced -

[page]4|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00004|dnp22b002pp|62765165[/page]
[nonenglish]nonenglish_009|quere[/nonenglish]. Will the tongue be affected when the
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] is wholly covered by Sulp sol[superscript]n[/superscript] in
a bottle thus or when the silver
is covered with a fluid
thus
x
[Ink sketches]
Or supposing the leg of
the frog substituted for the tongue in those arcs. -
[Horizontal rule]
Let attempts be made to prevent
the solution of sulphure from oxidating &
see what follows then (if [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
appearances should be produced under
[underline]all the other circumstances). -[/underline]
[nonenglish]nonenglish_009|Qu[/nonenglish] may not the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] habitudes of
metals be altered by making the nonoxidable
common exciter oxidate, thus let a circuit
be composed of iron [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] | [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical] sol[superscript]n[/superscript] / water or
x
acid & muscular fibre
or silver & [chemical]chemical_140|charcoal[/chemical]
or any other[deletion]s[/deletion] metals. -

[nonenglish]nonenglish_009|Qu[/nonenglish] What would be the effect of electrifying
all the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plates of a circle
positively when the connecting fluid
medium was, solution of sulphure ? (which
produces no [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] effects?
)probably many exciting causes besides
oxidation will be found to excite [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
electricity in metals ; such metals may become
the means of [deletion]exci[/deletion] conducting electricity
excited in organic bodies; or in
oxydating solutions: strong analogies
are in favor of animal Electricity; those
of the [misc]misc_233|Torpedo[/misc] particularly.
[Horizontal rule]
I tried to day the Query concerning taste
& Sulphure the arc was made thus. [misc]misc_702|See [insertion][unclear]plate[/unclear][/insertion][/misc]
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was finely polished & fastened 
to the glass tube by cement; the silver
wire was carefully in contact with
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & no foreign moisture
suffered to interfere
The [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was cemented into
[ink sketch of the experimental arrangement]
a glass tube & covered with
solution of Sulphure; the wire connected

[page]6|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00006|dnp22b004pp|62765167[/page]
with the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was free; [deletion]the tube w[/deletion] the
communication was made by means of
wetted linnen introduced into a
glass tube [ink sketch]. No difference
could be perceived be[insertion]tw[/insertion]en weak
solution of Sulphure & water. -
The caustic taste was very
sensible with both; it was sensible
when the silver was held by a hand
moistened in Sol[superscript]n[/superscript] of Sulphure of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] -
[nonenglish]nonenglish_009|Que[superscript]re[/superscript][/nonenglish] may not changes taking place
between the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & the Solution though
not changes of oxidation produce the
effect? or is one kind of electricity
existing in the nerves discharged
by the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & another kind existing
in the muscles by the silver? -
- This would account for excitation
[underline]by single rubbed arcs. -[/underline]
[nonenglish]nonenglish_009|quere[/nonenglish] would not the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] powers of
iron or [chemical]chemical_038|Tin[/chemical] be destroyed; by metallic saturated
solutions at min[superscript]m[/superscript] of oxidation possessing
stronger affinities for [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] than the
metals. -

The sulphure exp[superscript]t[/superscript] just detailed was the same
when a strong solution was used as when
a weak one -
And this when the solution of sulphure
was [deletion]xxxx[/deletion] covered over with [misc]misc_372|tallow[/misc]
so as to be out of the contact
of the atmosphere. ( I used [misc]misc_372|tallow[/misc]
because oil is insufficient ; vid ;
exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] on green oxides of iron &
on [misc]misc_220|the air pump[/misc] .) yea even after
it was covered for some time [insertion]half an hour[/insertion] with
[misc]misc_372|tallow[/misc] & perfectly excluded from
the free air it must however be remembered
that, the water in the little connecting
tube was in contact with the air . .
it continued to act with equal vividness
for near an half hour. -
[horizontal rule]
The Silver [insertion]wire[/insertion] was now inclosed in solution
of sulphure; the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was indecisive -

After more than 15 hours the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
acted under solution of Sulphure of

~ Essay 1[superscript]t[/superscript] On Atmospheric Air -
As far as we are acquainted with the history of human
existence we can perceive no material alterations in
the objects of [deletion]human[/deletion] perception; the physical laws of
nature have undergone no perceptible modifications
they have acted upon Man & upon the universe
 [deletion]with the same or[/deletion] since the beginning [deletion]xxx[/deletion][insertion]of[/insertion]
time with the same intensity & the same
uniformity. Whence then has arisen the progression
of human powers? The solution of this problem
would exibit the history of the progress of
knowledge. - It is only to be sought for
in the comparison between the moral & physical
powers of man. The moral powers of Man
are those included under the name
volition: it is this volition directed by
[deletion]articu[/deletion] language which has produced
all the improvements distinguishing
civilized man. -

~ On Atmospheric air ~
11. To give a history of the [deletion]chemic[/deletion] experiments which
have proved atmospheric air to be a compound
would be exibiting the disgusting minutiae of
a number of similar facts; whenever
certain bodies at certain temperatures are
introduced into a given quantity of
atmospheric air; their properties are
altered; they increase in weight, they
diminish the volume of the air &[deletion] this[/deletion]
leave a remainder possessed [deletion]by[/deletion] of
new properties . -
That the bodies that decompose atmospheric
air give out nothing which has altered
[deletion]the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the constitution of that [deletion]part[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] residuum is evident from the reproduction
of a fluid highly analogous to air by mixing
the gas produced in certain chemical processes
with this residuum . -
[unclear]Is[/unclear] Water one of the constituents of
atmospheric air heat produced by its
condensation .

[underline]3[superscript]d[/superscript] Paper in N. J. ?[/underline]
~ Observations on [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person]. .
~ particularly on Animal [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person] ~
- In two papers published in [person]person_236|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Nicholsons[/person]
philosophical Journal I have adduced numerous facts
all of which concur in proving that the Electrical
effects produced by the [person]person_269|Galvanic battery[/person]
or series of [person]person_199|Volta[/person] & all other similar series
owe their primary excitement to the
oxidation of certain of the metallic plates.
But the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] series of [person]person_199|Volta[/person] may be
considered as an assemblage of single
[person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] circles in which metallic plates
possessed of different powers for conducting
electricity are immediately in contact
in one point & mediately in contact
in other points [deletion]by[/deletion] through water & similarly
arranged [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] plates. Consequently
in the analysis of the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] pile we
must endeavor to consider each circle
its action & electrical powers -
Before the wonderful discoveries of [person]person_199|Volta[/person]
[deletion]Nih[/deletion] Nicholson, [person]person_493|Carlisle[/person] &c. the labors of
[person]person_269|Galvani[/person][deletion]c[/deletion] [person]person_268|Ritter [/person]&c had proved that
whenever certain metallic bodies organic

[page]12|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00012|dnp22b010pp|62765173[/page]
bodies &c were placed in certain degrees
of approximation actions [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] changes took
place which could not be accounted
for by simple chemical laws. The phaenomena
of taste muscular irritation & oxydation
constituted these changes.
It was observed by [person]person_270|Ash[/person] & confirmed by
[person]person_271|Humboldt[/person]. & [person]person_268|Ritter[/person], that when [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver
were brought in contact in one point
& in other points brought in contact
with water - that the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] oxidated more
rapidly than if it had been simply
in contact with water.
[person]person_325|Sultzer[/person] observed the phaenomena of taste
And [person]person_269|Galvani[/person] the power of certain
metals to stimulate the limbs of frogs.
When water is the medium of [insertion]secondary[/insertion] connexion
between [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver in contact in one point
the water [insertion]holding in solution oxidated bodies[/insertion] becomes decomposed more rapidly

[deletion]In July 1799 I accidentally discovered in making[/deletion]
[deletion]the experiment on the illumination of [chemical]chemical_151|phosphorus[/chemical][/deletion]
[deletion]beneath the surface of water by means of Sulphuric[/deletion]
[deletion]acid & oxygenated muriate of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical][/deletion]
When highly concentrated [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] is poured
upon [insertion]about 1/100 of its weight[/insertion] oxygenated muriate of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] it immediately
assumes a deep orange red color [deletion][/deletion] at
its points of contact with the salt & as
the salt becomes dissolved this color is
diffused through it, [deletion]if[/deletion] during the
process little or no gas is given out ~
If after the acid is thus altered
in its properties oxyd muriate is introduced
into it gas is given out with rapidity
which proves that the alteration
of the properties of the acid is
perfect. - The deep orange colored
compound thus formed is combinable
with water in the same way as
common [chemical]chemical_417|Sulphuric acid[/chemical] with the
production of much heat & no
more gas is liberated than might
have owed its origin to the common

[page]14|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00014|dnp22b012pp|62765175[/page]
air contained in the water, when about
half its weight of water is
added to the compound it becomes
of a deep [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] yellow & in
proportion as the quantity of water
is greater its color becomes fainter.
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] All the metals not excepting gold
& [chemical]chemical_369|Platinum[/chemical] dissolve [unclear]without light [/unclear]

in it white precipitates.
It appears to possess at common
temperatures but a feeble action
upon alcohol, ether & most inflammable
bodies, if however they are poured
upon it when it is briskly
heated . they produce inflammation
of considerable vividness. -
When this compound is exposed to
heat oxygenated [chemical]chemical_016|muriatic acid gas[/chemical]
is given out from it with
great rapidity . . [nonenglish]nonenglish_009|quere[/nonenglish] will it not
freeze?

[Ink sketches of photometer]
The modes heretofore usually adopted for
determining the intensity of light have been
founded upon its property of heating or
expanding bodies - It has long been well
known [unclear]x[/unclear] that the action [insertion]of light[/insertion] is greatest upon dark
opaque bodies, [deletion]but as those opaque bodies[/deletion] [insertion]& such [deletion]& those bodies[/deletion][/insertion] have been consequently
[deletion]cannot be subjected to the influence of[/deletion] [insertion]used either as simple or compound photometers[/insertion]

[That]What[/unclear] as every where on the surface of the Earth; both in gaseous & fluid mediums [unclear]alt[superscript]s[/superscript][/unclear] in temp are perp[superscript]ly[/superscript] occuring no body can be acted on by light
[underline]light[/underline] without being [insertion]at the same time[/insertion] subjected to the
[overwritten]action[/overwritten] [overwrite]agency[/overwrite] of other causes capable of altering
[deletion]their[/deletion] its temperature & consequently of altering
[deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] capacity for receiving [insertion]new[/insertion] increments of heat
it is evident [insertion]then[/insertion] that numerous corrections
which cannot be generalized in any
simple principles must be made
for all photometers. [deletion]founded on[/deletion] the
fundamental principle of which is
[deletion]founded on[/deletion] the heating of opaque
bodies by light. -
The most perfect photometer of this
kind would probably be composed of
two tubes [deletion][superscript]wi[/superscript][/deletion] of equal diameters [insertion]with[/insertion] both [insertion]bulbs[/insertion]
containing [deletion]colored[/deletion][insertion]dark or black[/insertion] fluids in capable
of being [deletion]hea[/deletion] chemically altered by
light, & having their partial vacuums
filled with vapor or [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] gas -
One of these tubes should be inclosed
as far as the [insertion]neck of the[/insertion] bulb & above
in [insertion]white[/insertion] opaque glass so as to [insertion]screen it[/insertion] effectually
[deletion]screen it[/deletion] from the light at the
same time that it [deletion]suffered[/deletion] [insertion]permittd[/insertion] [deletion]the[/deletion] a
[deletion]current of air to pass through it[/deletion]
free circulation of air -

[page]18|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00018|dnp22b016pp|62765179[/page]
The other tube should be exposed to
light [deletion]& a scale[/deletion] it scale should
form the medium of connexion
between them & the difference
between the number of degrees
marked by the two fluids should
be considered as the increment of
heat from light - The following
sketch will give some idea of the nature
of the [deletion]machine[/deletion] instrument.
[sketches of two instruments resembling thermometers]
This instrument would be perfect
supposing that at [deletion]low tem[/deletion] different
temperatures the increase of expansion
from [insertion]equal quantities[/insertion] light would be always
equal; [deletion]but at low temperatures[/deletion]
but supposing the common laws of heat
to apply to the case ; it will follow
that the heat produced by light will
be conducted off more rapidly in
proportion as the temperature is
low. - & that the degree at which
the highest quantity of light is
marked will be low in proportion
as the circumambient bodies are colder. -

In thermometers there [deletion]are different[/deletion]
[deletion]heating & c[/deletion] is only one body active
in producing the change of temperature
in this [deletion]body[/deletion][insertion]photometer[/insertion] there would be at least
two bodies; besides in proportion as
the temperature [insertion]of the fluid[/insertion] is high the expansibility
of the vapor or gas would be
increased [deletion]& this[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]which[/deletion]& this[/insertion] would act as a
slight opposing cause to the expansibility
of the gas [insertion]fluid[/insertion] [deletion]from this however no[/deletion]
[deletion]material source of error could arise -[/deletion]
An account of a photometer has been
lately published by [person]person_786|M[superscript]r[/superscript] Leslie[/person] who expresses
great confidence in the perfectness &
beauty of the invention [deletion]the principle[/deletion]
[deletion]on which it is founded is the increment[/deletion]

It is founded upon the common principle
& differes in nothing from a common
light thermometer except in the degrees being
marked by the expansion of a column
of air. It is liable to give
erroneous conclusions like the common
light thermometer from the agency of

I To ascertain the peculiar phaenomena exibited by
single [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] arcs [deletion]in contact with water holding in[/deletion]
composed of two metallic bodies of different
degrees of oxydability & water holding in solution
Atmospheric air I cemented into a conical glass
tube a triangular piece of polished [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] in
such a manner that 9/10 of the surface
of the metal was within the tube; [deletion]whilst[/deletion]
the apex of the triangle the point at
which it was cemented to the tube protruded
into the atmosphere. - R[superscript]ound[/superscript] this apex a piece
of silver wire was twirled & the extremity
of it introduced [insertion]far[/insertion] into another small tube
[deletion]open[/deletion] & cemented in it so as to leave only
one opening; both these tubes were filled
with water holding in a solution a
very little sulphate of [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical] & inverted
in a cup [deletion]of water[/deletion] containing the
same fluid. - so that a perfect [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
circuit was formed in close vessels. -
This app[superscript]s[/superscript] was set up on Nov[superscript]r[/superscript] 9[superscript]th[/superscript]
& suffered to rest till Dec[superscript]r[/superscript] 1[superscript]st[/superscript] -
During the first two days but little alteration

was perceived at the end of the third
day the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] began to whiten at one
of its corners without giving out any
gas ~ At the end of a fortnight
The [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] had become much oxidated
but no gas had collected in either
of the tubes the silver became incrusted
at its point with a little whitish
matter. -
At the conclusion of the exp[superscript]t[/superscript] no gas had
been produced but the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was much
oxidated & the silver every where
at its points of contact with the water
incrusted with a white matter which
was evidently a precipitate from the
sulphate of [chemical]chemical_011|Magnesia[/chemical]. - It was
soluble with effervescence & without cloudiness
in [chemical]chemical_016|Muriatic acid[/chemical]. -
From this exp[superscript]t[/superscript] it appeared probable that
[chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] had been fixed on the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] of this
circle whilst [chemical]chemical_007|Hydrogene[/chemical] had been protruded
on the silver & had combined with
atmospheric air to form [chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical]. -
I repeated it with distilled water

[page]28|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00028|dnp22b026pp|62765189[/page]
holding in solution a little red cabbage
juice; in this exp[superscript]t[/superscript]. no crust was
formed on the silver wire nor
was any gas given out [deletion]from the[/deletion]
[chemical]chemical_201|[deletion]zinc[/deletion][/chemical] in either of the tubes though
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] oxidated with great rapidity
the color of the cabbage juice
These facts seemed to prove with
sufficient distinctness that [chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical]
was formed on the silver & oxide of
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] on the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical].
That this formation is primarily
owing to the oxidation of the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
I mentioned as probable in a former
paper. - In endeavoring to ascertain
whether primary oxidation was essential
to the increased action of single circles
I exposed single [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] circles consisting
of a [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] plate & a silver plate
moistened at their points of contact with
water in the exhausted receiver
I could never wholly prevent the
oxidation from taking place though
it went on very slowly. -

[page]29|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00029|dnp22b027pp|62765190[/page]
27
In boiled water it was not perceptible.
It ought to be remembered that the
metallic influence is never exerted
unless both the metals are in contact
with each other & the same quantity
of water thus if a plate of
dry silver be laid on a plate of
dry [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] [insertion]& the [deletion]silver[/deletion] or [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] alone[/insertion] little effect will follow.
but if the metals are in contact
with each other & both in contact
with the same drop of water &c.
- We have no positive proof
that the first change of electricity
is produced from the oxydation
evaporation or even a change of
temperature in the surrounding at
mosphere may generate; but the
facts compared with those of
batterical [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person] are strongly
in favor of the oxydation being the
most powerful primary exciter. -
It seems that no [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] action is
produced unless [underline]simple[/underline] changes are first
occasioned. -

[page]30|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00030|dnp22b028pp|62765191[/page]
II But supposing that the modifications effected
in inorganic bodies by [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person] are owing
to the primary excitement of this [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person]
from chemical changes; it does not follow
that the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] signs produced by
metals in organic bodies must likewise
depend upon the oxydation of the metals
it is easy to conceive that different
~ [deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Steele[/deletion] - charges of electrical matter
pre-existing in living animals may
be conducted away in different
ratios and & this seemed confirmed
by the phaenomena of excitation
by single metals or by [unclear]rubbed[/unclear]
metals. The phaenomena of taste
are those which [person]person_327|Fabbroni[/person] has principally
insisted to depend upon metallic
oxydation & before I began to exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
I had no doubt but that his
opinion was right. I conjectured that
the fixation of [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] upon the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
& the formation of [chemical]chemical_003|Ammoniac[/chemical] upon
the silver must occasion the phaenomena

[page]31|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00031|dnp22b029pp|62765192[/page]
29
of causticity exibited by those metals.
- I had found however that this
taste was producible when neither
of the metals were in contact with
organic matter by connecting them
with [insertion]two portions of[/insertion] water [insertion]one[/insertion] in contact with the
tongue & the other in contact with
any part of the body.
It of course became easy to prevent
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] from oxidating itself by
connecting it with[insertion]only[/insertion] a fluid incapable
of giving it [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] & then connecting
that fluid with another tasteless
fluid to the tongue. -
After several exp[superscript]ts[/superscript] upon different
fluids I found that solutions of
sulphures of strontian & [chemical]chemical_042|barytes[/chemical]
were the only fluid conductors of
[person]person_269|Galvanism[/person] which [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was incapable
of altering, [chemical]chemical_068|sulphites[/chemical] metallic salts
& even sulphures of Alkalies on
[deletion]enabled [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] to change itself[/deletion]
account of the difficulty of wholly
freeying them from sulphates. When
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was introduced into pure sol[superscript]n[/superscript]

[page]32|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00032|dnp22b030pp|62765193[/page]
of sulphure of Strontian in many days
it effected no alteration of
it After several contrivances
To ascertain whether the metallic
taste was producible when [insertion]the[/insertion] [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical]
was unable to oxidate itself I
enclosed a perfectly polished flat
triangular piece of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] in
a conical tube in such a
way that the surface within the
tube could be wholly covered with
a fluid - & that a small portion
projected externally - to this portion
was attached a piece of silver
wire, [deletion]a small[/deletion] some [deletion]bibulous[/deletion]
[deletion]cloth was[/deletion] wetted thread was introduced
into [insertion]small[/insertion] a glass tube which was made
to rest in the inside of the tube
containing the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] - This tube
was filled with water, so that the
[chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was [deletion]wholly in co[/deletion] in contact
with no other oxydating body but [deletion]air[/deletion]
water. When the tongue was put to
the thread in the tube no sensation
was perceived. - the silver being applied

mem the non conductor -
to some part of a moistened surface or
the tongue a metallic taste was
perfectly perceptible -
The water was now taken out
& solution of sulphure of Strontian
inserted in its stead , the wetted thread
being still the connecting medium between
the solution & the tongue. As often
as the communication was made
the metallic taste was as sensible as
when the water was employed. -
The effects were exactly the same
when solution of sulphure of [chemical]chemical_030|potash[/chemical] was
used. -
This exp[superscript]t[/superscript] was repeated a number
of times under different circumstances
the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] [deletion]was parti[/deletion] & silver were
partially covered with cement so that
no part of the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] was exposed
to the atmosphere & it was
wholly in contact with bodies
incapable of supplying it with [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical].
the silver was grasped between the
wetted fingers as far as its point

of cementation so that the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
circuit was composed of living animal
water solution. of sulphures [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver
still the same effects were perceived -
In short a number of experiments
seemed to prove that the taste or
caustic sensation was capable of
being produced independently of the
metallic influence. -
On what then could it depend
could the oxydation of the solution
[deletion]by of[/deletion] or evaporation from it produces
those changes in the equilibrium
of electricity which affected the organs
of taste or must we conclude
that the metals acted only as
conductors of a peculiar nature
in carrying away electricity of
a peculiar kind [unclear]pre[/unclear]existing in the
nervous & muscular papillae.
I now covered the whole of a solution
of sulphure with melted [misc]misc_372|tallow[/misc]

as a a single series of phaenomena.
Nothing can be more evident than that
all the chemical changes & divers agencies that [insertion]insoluble[/insertion] Heat & light

upon primary chemical changes & the

& [person]person_268|Ritter [/person]& the last of these philosophers
found that [deletion]provided[/deletion] [insertion]one point of contact between[/insertion] the metals

I have found that all the substances

induce us to beleive that the

It has been advanced by [person]person_327|Fabbroni[/person] that

I have lately made many exp[superscript]ts[/superscript]
to ascertain whether single circles
do not act unless the water

air [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical] &c -
I [deletion]exposed in [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] plunged two polished
plates of silver & [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] into [deletion]polis[/deletion] water
that had been long boiling & was
yet warm & bringing them [insertion]surfaces[/insertion] in contact
wrapped round them a number

preserve the plates from the

A circle composed of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] &

[deletion]Thus if[/deletion] a circle of [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] & silver
[insertion]covered below the point[/insertion] be placed at the bottom of a vessel
of water the [chemical]chemical_201|Zinc[/chemical] became much
less rapidly oxidated than if it
was exposed to the atmosphere
When I was exp[superscript]g[/superscript] on the [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
pile in [chemical]chemical_022|Oxygene[/chemical], I exposed a single
[person]person_269|Galvanic[/person] circle [deletion]exposed to[/deletion] attached to

[unclear]xx[/unclear] That action analogous to the

evident from the phaenomenon of

enable us to affirm that the

The contemplation of the most
simple phaenomenon of [person]person_269|Galvanism[/person]
authorise us to suppose that
they depend upon chemical changes
& we are certain that chemical
 changes are perpetually going on
in the human body & that
many of its functions depend
upon those changes. the new
equilibriums of electricity produced
in the living organs must necess
arily be possessed of a considerable
influence on their functions
but it is more than probable

[page]158|MS-DAVY-12202-000-00158|dnp22b156pp|62765319[/page]
that the metals do not act
as simple conductors of [person]person_269|Galvanic[/person]
influence; but as producers of
it by undergoing some chemical changes
& thus forming part of a

To speak of the importance of a

They afford us pleasure in all cases
