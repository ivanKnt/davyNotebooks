disapointment
[deletion]For me [insertion][deletion]humbly[/deletion][/insertion] Alas I doubt their learned lore 
Their reasoning tales [insertion]sober books[/insertion] I cannot not much admire
Oer the [unclear]welprinted[/unclear] page in vain I pore.
The [unclear]Runes[/unclear] [insertion]legend[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] by the winters fire
For me has more of interest more of life
Than all their
Of fairy or the Knights immortal Glor[deletion]y[/deletion]ies
In me upstirs a far more lovely joy
Than any of [unclear]their[/unclear] modern moral [insertion]stories[/insertion]
Of prudent youth & virtuous girl
& Boy.[/deletion]
For me I deem it so [unclear]immortal merit[/unclear]
To check the swelling of the noble spirit
For will, I ween the loftiest virtue loves
That mind in which the greatest fancy
moves
And by Imaginations power
