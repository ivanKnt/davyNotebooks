- Yet did this [underline]Venerable person[/underline]
from an unceasing activity
& a constantly acting spirit of
curiosity make more discoveries
than any other [deletion]more refined[/deletion]
[deletion]scientist[/deletion] chemical philosopher-" And though
His theories were always crude
& reasonings imperfect from
a want of extensive knowledge
of the subject yet [deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion]He established
a reputation of the highest
[underline]character[/underline], for the glory of
[underline][unclear]practical discoveries[/unclear] [/underline] will always
justly be placed above that of
a theoretical [unclear]Inventor[/unclear] - For He
provides [underline]the materials[/underline] without
which the arranging spirit would
be wholly idle would have nothing
to do. -
