Romance I see no reason, I say why
a History of this Kind should
not be as entertaining & yeild
as strong & as durable an
interest as any fictitious tale
of [underline]Heroical Adventures[/underline], [deletion]which[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] & its useful tendency would
undoubtedly be very much greater;
for the one tends in many
cases to often to mislead
[underline]the mind[/underline], it is an unhealthy
Stimulus - It is like living
upon Pepper & Salt & Brandy
whilst the other is a good
a wholesome & a natural food
& one I conceive much more
likely to be relished by an healthy
Stomach. -
