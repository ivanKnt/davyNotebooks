[deletion]In stating these as obstacles[/deletion]
I state these as obstacles to the
success of a [underline]general Lecturer[/underline] & they
are obstacles which particularly apply
in the Case of the Science which
it is my [underline]business to teach[/underline]; for
[underline]Chemistry[/underline] depends upon artificial operations
familiar only [unclear]to[/unclear] a few; the
facts [deletion]of[/deletion]require minute [deletion]experiments[/deletion] [insertion][underline]processes[/underline][/insertion]
[underline]for their demonstration -[/underline] Unlike the
objects of Literature & the Sciences
[underline]connected with Man[/underline], [underline]its instances[/underline]
are limited & it admits of
no appeal to [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]ideas common to all or to[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] general feelings
& passions [insertion]or[/insertion] [deletion]of Men; &[/deletion] it sources of
interest are connected only with the
quiet devellopment of the laws of
Nature or with the peaceful dominion
over her powers & their application
to useful purposes. -
