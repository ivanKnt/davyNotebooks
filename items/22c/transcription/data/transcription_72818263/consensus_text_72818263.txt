- Milton undoubtedly has given
great enjoyment to the imagination
[deletion]by [unclear]x[/unclear][/deletion] & has raised noble & Heroical
thoughts & lofty & virtuous sentiments .
but his influence has been comparatively
little extensive - different nations form
[underline]different opinions[/underline], the most superb
of his ideas cannot be rendered

some connections with Locality -.
And [underline]even the taste[/underline] is variable
" the capricious & the mutable oppose
themselves to any standard" - The
mixed Mythology [deletion][unclear]of[/unclear][/deletion] religion of
Tasso is more delight to some
than the purer machinery of Milton
