Let it not be conceived that
I am endeavoring to advance the
Science [deletion]to[/deletion] above all branches
of Knowledge, or that it is
my interest & my end to exaggerate
its advantages- I trust whatever
I attempt [deletion]this[/deletion] I shall never
indulge in this folly - The
Knowledge of Nature must be always
subservient to the Knowledge
