No Rocks have been more objects of discussion
than the different species of Basalt and
their congenerous strata. the most opposite
theories have been invented to explain their
formation and as yet the question is still
at Issue between the advocates for the agency
of fire and the beleiver in the operation
of water the plutonist desire a strong
argument for the support of their theory
from the experiments of Sir James Hall
and M[superscript]r[/superscript] Gregory Watt in these experiments
they affirm a stone closely resembling Basalt
has evidently been formed by [unclear]fussion[/unclear] and
slow cooling where as in no one instance
have the constituent parts of this Rock
been dissolved by water.
This position though at first view appear
 very strong is far from being incontrovertible
those chrystalized masses obtained by my
worthy Freinds though when superficialy
examined they appear very analogous [deletion]to [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
