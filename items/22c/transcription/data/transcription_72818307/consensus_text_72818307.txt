[deletion]Oberser[/deletion] [underline]Observations on Rocks and Veins[/underline]
Geology has has its origin and speculation.
But theoretical discussions have by degrees led to
the establishment of a number of important facts
and these may now be considered as forming the
foundations of the science.
A number of Authors have paid very minute
attention to the nature and position of the strata
which form the more exterior surface of the Globe
but as yet very few observations have been made
upon the mode in which the different Rocks
composing these strata are united or upon th[unclear]e[/unclear]
effects of their intersection [insertion]by[/insertion] and contacts with
veins.
In this paper I shall have the honor of laying
before the society some remarks on these important
subjects I have endeavoured to elucidate the
inquiry by various experiments and though
I cannot hope to be able to give a complete
history of the phaenomena yet still I trust
that I may be able to supply some useful
truths in relation to them
