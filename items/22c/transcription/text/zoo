- There [insertion]are[/insertion] undoubtedly in Science
fortunate combinations- there are
happy times, in which new inventions
bestow new powers & in which there
are as it were compelled to follow
a [deletion]new &[/deletion] easy path to Glory:
but [deletion]though there is[/deletion] [insertion]for all this[/insertion] an [deletion]apparent[/deletion]
occasional interference of accident
[deletion]in the progress of discovery[/deletion], [underline]Labour[/underline]
steady [underline]& uninterrupted labour[/underline] & the
virtue of continued attention are
the true sources of noble & happy
discoveries; & who ever possesses
these enviable habits of Mind has
the chief & the most certain elements

[page]34||dnp22c028pp|72818215[/page]
of success.- In the study of Nature
there can be no exertion thrown
away; [deletion]for the more minutely the[/deletion]
[deletion]objects of it are considered[/deletion] for the
general Laws belonging to it are
no less simple [insertion]& grand[/insertion] than the oeconomy
which they govern is complicated &
[unclear]minute[/unclear] & when observation [unclear]as[/unclear]

[deletion]these the[/deletion] which are constanly becoming

who having ascertained great truths
in a particular depart[unclear]'[/unclear] of Science
should pretend to fix them as
limits would act as ridiculously

are undoubtedly connected with the
powers by which lofty tricks are
attained & they belonged in the highest
degree to the Author of the
principia & the optics; but these
alone though essential to the
devellopement of his abilities
would have accomplished nothing .
without that faculty of continued
exertion which induced him to
pass [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear] whole[/deletion] [insertion]successive[/insertion] nights [insertion]& days[/insertion] in contemplation
[deletion]without sleep[/deletion] inattentive to the
wants of the body which enabled him
to attain that [underline]sublime state of intellect[/underline]
in which all [deletion]objects[/deletion] sensible objects
[underline]were excluded[/underline] & in which the mind
was nourished by its own thoughts
concerning the Laws of the heavens
& the Earth, made the subjects of
active meditation -
Perhaps no Man again will
ever find such a ground to occupy & therefore

[page]37||dnp22c031pp|72818218[/page]

no Man will be able to unite
such extensive powers- the different
objects of the Science of Nature

elucidated by new facts & it
is not necessary for the devellopment
of these facts that the Enquirer
should possess the highest active
[underline]talents[/underline]. [underline]In Chemistry[/underline] there
are number of insulated departments
which do not even require
a general Knowledge of the
Science & which nevertheless very
curious discoveries may be made
by activity & varied labour.
An instance of what may be
done in this way is offered
by the very extensive & noble

stimulated by the example of
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black & other eminent Men
He began his researches upon

great reason for supposing that the phaenomena
to the undecompounded Rocks of which larger
or smaller quantities are uniformly thrown
out by the Volcano all writers who treated
eruptions have uniformly described the lava
as flowing slowly and as containing large
quantities of unmelted stony matter and
it is therefore reasonable to conclude that
the stony appearance exhibited by their
interior may be owing to the circumstance

win yet when minutely considered are discovered
to be possessed of characters essentialy different
the chrystalized substance obtained by the fusion
of Basalt is always of uniform texture and
constituted by one speci of material whereas the
original Rock always consists of at least two
different species of chrystalized matter and
in all the w[insertion]h[/insertion]ins from the largest grained
green stone to the most compact Basalt
there is always perceived a certain intermix[insertion]ture[/insertion]
of feldspar and Hornblend besides though at a
low temperature water may be incapable of
operating on these substances yet at a high
one the case may be altered and as the whins
contain alkali this substance considerably
tend to facilitate the combination with
fluid the analogy of whin to lava has been
strongly urged in favour of the igneous
hypothesis but this analogy is in fact only
imaginary true lavas uniformly exhibit
the appearance of glass or [unclear]chrystalite[/unclear]
and when they appear stony there is

No Rocks have been more objects of discussion
than the different species of Basalt and
their congenerous strata. the most opposite
theories have been invented to explain their
formation and as yet the question is still
at Issue between the advocates for the agency
of fire and the beleiver in the operation
of water the plutonist desire a strong
argument for the support of their theory
from the experiments of Sir James Hall
and M[superscript]r[/superscript] Gregory Watt in these experiments
they affirm a stone closely resembling Basalt
has evidently been formed by [unclear]fussion[/unclear] and
slow cooling where as in no one instance
have the constituent parts of this Rock
been dissolved by water.
This position though at first view appear
 very strong is far from being incontrovertible
those chrystalized masses obtained by my
worthy Freinds though when superficialy
examined they appear very analogous [deletion]to [unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]

[deletion]Oberser[/deletion] [underline]Observations on Rocks and Veins[/underline]
Geology has has its origin and speculation.
But theoretical discussions have by degrees led to
the establishment of a number of important facts
and these may now be considered as forming the
foundations of the science.
A number of Authors have paid very minute
attention to the nature and position of the strata
which form the more exterior surface of the Globe
but as yet very few observations have been made
upon the mode in which the different Rocks
composing these strata are united or upon th[unclear]e[/unclear]
effects of their intersection [insertion]by[/insertion] and contacts with
veins.
In this paper I shall have the honor of laying
before the society some remarks on these important
subjects I have endeavoured to elucidate the
inquiry by various experiments and though
I cannot hope to be able to give a complete
history of the phaenomena yet still I trust
that I may be able to supply some useful
truths in relation to them

- I am however convinced that
such a power might be made
of great use - might be
very properly applied- Guys

perhaps the best school of
Medicine existing; but it is much

be from the [deletion][unclear]impossib[/unclear][/deletion] circumstance

They should be systematically arranged

that nothing would be more likely

the founding a museum for commerce
