|_ Many scientific persons before Bacon
had pursued the method of exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
in all its precision, many had
dared to despise the logic & forms
of the Ancients. But He was the
[underline]first Philosopher [/underline] who, laid down
Plans for extending knowledge of
universal application, who ventured
to assert that all [insertion]the[/insertion] Sciences
could be nothing more than
expressions of facts & that the
first step towards the attainment
of [underline]real[/underline] discovery was the [insertion]humiliating[/insertion] [underline]confession[/underline]
of [underline]ignorance[/underline] .-
Bacon was prepared by Nature
by education & by his habits
of study for effecting the great
revolution in Philosophy.
