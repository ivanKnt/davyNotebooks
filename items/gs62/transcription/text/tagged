[misc]misc_677|The [underline]Science of Nature[/underline] depends in a[/misc]
great measure upon artificial inventions
for assisting the faculties of the Mind,

a state of Society in which active
patronage is offered; & in which
it is assisted no less by the diffusion
of letters, than by the application
of industry, riches & power to its

It is not therefore extraordinary
that the [underline]spirit[/underline] of observation & of

Science. It was [deletion]wondered[/deletion] [insertion]regarded[/insertion] not
merely as affording the means

& as providing remedies for all

- [person]person_324|the elder Bacon[/person] confesses in his great

the foundations of his Knowledge
from the Arabian writers upon whom

a philosopher; but his Knowledge

in the age in which He lived.
the wonders produced by chemistry
[deletion]in the 3 Century[/deletion] were referred [insertion]by the people[/insertion] to
[deletion]to enchantment &[/deletion] the agency of
evil spirits - & a very short time
after He had written a book
to prove the [underline]nonexistence of magic[/underline]
He was himself persecuted as an
[underline]Enchanter[/underline]; & He was imprisoned in
1270 by the command of the principal
[deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] of the Franciscans for having
brought the order into disrepute
by pretending to [underline]natural wisdom[/underline]
& by excercising [underline]unholy[/underline] &

- [person]person_324|[person]person_324|Roger Bacon[/person][/person] appears to have
made use of the philosophical
& experimental methods of the [misc]misc_273|Saracens[/misc]
without following any of the [deletion]gross[/deletion]
absurdities of their doctrines; He
had seen admirable changes produced
in [deletion]Natural[/deletion] bodies & He Knew
not the limits of the operations of
Nature; [deletion]be to[/deletion] By him the [underline]production[/underline]
of Gold & the [underline]transmutation of[/underline]
[underline]metals[/underline] were considered only as
[underline]objects[/underline] worthy of investigation ; but
He never affirmed confidently concerning
them - He had made many important
[underline]discoveries[/underline] & particularly that of
an explosive compound similar to
Gunpowder - [deletion]&[/deletion] Yet He [deletion]never[/deletion] [insertion]seldom[/insertion] suffered
his imagination to [deletion][unclear]cloud him[/unclear][/deletion]

[page]14|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00014|dnpgs62_012pp|100776334[/page]
was no enthusiast with regard to
the merit of his inventions.
- He possessed the modest & dignified
feeling of Science ; but [deletion]the Alchemus[/deletion]
most of the Alchemists who
flourished in the next Century
were of a very different complexion.
They formed [deletion]a species of[/deletion] [insertion]themselves into a fraternity[/insertion]
[deletion]in which great[/deletion] They professed
to be in possession of
great & important secrets; They
connected a peculiar mysticism
with their philosophical doctrines
They attached to Alchemy a
language similar to that which
had been employed [deletion]by the[/deletion] in the
[deletion]School [underline]of [person]person_085|Plato[/person][/underline][/deletion] [insertion][person]person_085|Platonic[/person] philosophy[/insertion] & they
pretended not only to a Knowledge

[page]15|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00015|dnpgs62_013pp|100776335[/page]
of the [deletion]elements[/deletion] materials of
the Globe & the changes of
things, but likewise to an acquaintence
with the elements & the [insertion]spiritual[/insertion] powers
by which they [insertion]supposed they[/insertion] [deletion]were[/deletion] goverened. -
-. The Arabians had blended
in their philosophy many brilliant
superstitions concerning the agency
of a class of [underline]Beings[/underline] [insertion]supposed to be[/insertion] superior
to Man & possessed of great knowledge
& of high power; And the notions
of fairies & [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc] which have
been depicted with so much
vividness of fancy & liveliness
of description in the [otherwork]otherwork_123|thousand &[line]one nights[/otherwork] seem to have been
adopted under a new form
by the Adepts of [underline]this [deletion]time[/deletion] period[/underline] 

[page]16|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00016|dnpgs62_014pp|100776336[/page]
[underline]in[/underline] Europe; who though they altered
the denominations [underline]of the spiritual[/underline]
[underline]Agents created[/underline] by the fancy of
[underline]the orientalists[/underline]; still attributed to
them similar attributes & similar
[underline]relations[/underline] to man -
|_ [insertion]Space[/insertion] [person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] in his work on the
[underline]occult Sciences[/underline] endeavors to devellope
a general system of the philosophy
of the Earth. & He begins by supposing
that all things in the terrestrial
Globe are under the protection of
influences residing in the stars
& of good & evil [misc]misc_211|Genii[/misc]; & that
true knowledge can be derived
only from a communication with
these spiritual beings. -
- [person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] considered [underline]fire[/underline] as the
great active principle in Nature
& from its operation upon earth

[page]17|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00017|dnpgs62_015pp|100776337[/page]
which He regarded as a passive element
[deletion][underline]principle[/underline][/deletion] He conceived the [deletion]principal[/deletion] [insertion]great[/insertion]
appearances of the external
world to be produced. -
Water & Air He thought were
not capable of being converted
into each other; & [deletion]the more[/deletion] yet He
considered Air as a [underline]vital[/underline] principle
which existed in almost all
substances & [deletion]which was[/deletion] as essential
to their composition & their nature.
|_ This last passage is one of
the few philosophical ones in
his work the most worthy of
notice; His pages are [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] generally
filled with the grossest absurdities.
It is difficult to conjecture from them
whether He is self deluded or
whether He is endeavering to deceive
others, whether his imagination was
distempered, or whether He was
attempting an [deletion]gross[/deletion] imposture. -

[person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] was born at [place]place_1312|Cologne[/place]
in 1463. - After the publication
of his system, He was of course
considered as a magician by the
Vulgar & a number of idle tales
exist with regard to His history. -
He asserted the He was in
possession of the [misc]misc_381|Philosophers stone[/misc]
yet He was always miserably
poor -.- He affirmed that He had
spirits under his command who
were capable of conveying him
from place to place; & yet
He [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear] spent[/deletion] passed the last
years of his life in the prison
of [place]place_356|Lyons[/place]; where He was confined
not because He had professed
magic, but because He had violently

[page]19|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00019|dnpgs62_017pp|100776339[/page]
abused [person]person_1055|the Queen Mother of France.[/person] -
-. |_ The general system of [insertion]the famous[/insertion] [person]person_509|[underline]paracelsus[/underline][/person]
seems to have differed very little
from that of [person]person_069|Agrippa[/person] - He
supposed the [deletion]four[/deletion] elements under the
influence of stars & that all
the spaces in the universe [deletion]which[/deletion]
[deletion]appear to us void were really[/deletion]
[deletion]filled[/deletion] void of matter were filled
with [underline]peculiar spiritual beings[/underline]
And He has made use of
the very names which have
been so much employed in the
machinery of modern Poetry - Thus
[insertion]He regarded[/insertion] The sylphs & Gnomes [deletion]He regarded[/deletion]
as belonging to the Earth -
spectres to the Air, & [misc]misc_851|[underline]salamanders[/underline][/misc]
to the fire. -
[person]person_509|Paracelsus[/person], introduced [chemical]chemical_037|Sulphur[/chemical]

[page]20|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00020|dnpgs62_018pp|100776340[/page]
& [chemical]chemical_012|Mercury[/chemical] into his [deletion]system[/deletion] [insertion]theory[/insertion] as
principles composing the metals
& He regarded [underline]Animals[/underline] as chiefly
[deletion]principally[/deletion] constituted of
[underline]Air; & vegetables[/underline] of Earth. -
B The life of this Man who was
born in [underline][place]place_198|Switzerland[/place][/underline] in 1493 was
full of the most extraordinary
events. - He travelled through
most of the countries of Europe
& Asia & even passed a considerable
time in [place]place_222|Affrica[/place], seeking wherever
He went for [underline]secrets[/underline] in Chemistry
& professing to cure all maladies -
[insertion]His enthusiam almost supplied his want of Genius; & confidence in his own powers[/insertion]
[insertion]in this age was [unclear]xxx[/unclear] a more impressive in an [underline]empire[/underline][/insertion]
[deletion]He was appointed to the professors[/deletion]
[insertion]in past age [insertion]as well as in the present[/insertion] then common sense - He was appointed to the[/insertion]
Professor Chair at Bale [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] but
He soon contrived to disgust
the magistrates & to gain a
dismissal -. He was fond of

[page]21|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00021|dnpgs62_019pp|100776341[/page]
living only amongst the lower orders
of the people; & from associating
continually with his inferiors He
acquired the most offensive [deletion]confidence[/deletion] [insertion]vanity[/insertion]
[deletion]in himself & in[/deletion] [insertion]the most[/insertion] insupportable
arrogance. He abused the physicians
of his time in the grossest terms
He substituted chemical preparations
for [deletion][person]person_1104|[unclear]galenical[/unclear][/person] remedies[/deletion] [insertion]vegetable medicines[/insertion] ; And He
publicly burnt the works of
[person]person_1056|[underline]Avicenna[/underline][/person] saying that there were
no other [underline]masters[/underline] in medicine
but Nature & himself. He
passed his last days in wandering
about [deletion]German[/deletion] in [place]place_324|Germany[/place]; & When
He was reproached on account
of his way of life; - He proudly
answered; That it was not fit
for a [insertion]person[/insertion] [deletion]Man[/deletion] born to succour
the whole of Mankind, to attach himself

[page]22|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00022|dnpgs62_020pp|100776342[/page]
to any one spot & that He
who was determined to read [underline]the book[/underline]
[underline]of Nature[/underline] ought not to have
his eyes always fixed upon the
same leaf. C
[person]person_221|[underline]Van Helmont[/underline][/person] of [place]place_1147|Brussels[/place] like
[person]person_509|[underline]paracelsus[/underline][/person] was a mystic; but
He combined much more sound philosophy
in his views of Nature & of
the Earth - He was a diligent
experimenter & a minute observer
& some of his researches led to
important results. He was
the first person who supposed
that [chemical]chemical_078|elastic fluid[/chemical] existed different
from the Air of the Atmosphere
& [underline]from him[/underline] we derive the
modern [underline]chemical[/underline] name [underline]of Gas[/underline].
- He likewise invented another

[page]23|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00023|dnpgs62_021pp|100776343[/page]
denomination [misc]misc_852|[underline]Blas[/underline][/misc] , which is not
quite so intelligible - He considered
it as [deletion]the[/deletion] of a much finer
nature than Air; & as being
derived by the earth from
the Sun & Stars -
[person]person_221|Van Helmont[/person] made some very laborious
experiments to prove that Water
was capable of being converted
into [underline]earth[/underline] |_ & He [underline]revived[/underline]
the doctrine of [person]person_609|Thales[/person] that it
was the [deletion][unclear]principle great[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]general[/insertion] productive
principle. -
[deletion]In[/deletion] The [deletion]fifteenth[/deletion] [underline]Sixteenth [insertion]16[/insertion][/underline] Century
was the [underline]great era[/underline] in which
the Mystical Adepts flourished; [deletion]&[/deletion]
The famous [misc]misc_410|Rosicrucian[/misc] Society

[underline]& [deletion]Geological[/deletion] Knowledge[/underline].-
They were [underline]experimenters[/underline] with false
views; but they nevertheless sometimes

[page]25|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00025|dnpgs62_023pp|100776345[/page]
develloped truth;- They were indefatigable

most curious properties of bodies without
being able to account philosophically
for their effects - Though Visionaries
they sometimes acted according
to the dictates of right reason
As persons who walk in their

The facts scattered amongst their

|_ Many scientific persons before [person]person_124|Bacon[/person]
had pursued the method of exp[superscript]t[/superscript]
in all its precision, many had
dared to despise the logic & forms
of the Ancients. But He was the
[underline]first Philosopher[/underline] who, laid down
Plans for extending knowledge of
universal application, who ventured
to assert that all [insertion]the[/insertion] Sciences
could be nothing more than
expressions of facts & that the
first step towards the attainment
of [underline]real[/underline] discovery was the [insertion]humiliating[/insertion] [underline]confession[/underline]
of [underline]ignorance[/underline] .-
[person]person_124|Bacon[/person] was prepared by Nature
by education & by his habits
of study for effecting the great
revolution in Philosophy.

His Knowledge was extensive, His
instances were copious. His Genius
was equally capable of develloping
the lighter & the more profound
relations of things. - He possessed
a [underline]strong [deletion]poetic[/deletion] feeling[/underline] ; but it
was uniformly directed by
[deletion]his[/deletion] [underline]reason[/underline] - He was gifted
with a vivid imagination;
but it was modified &
[deletion]refined[/deletion] by a most correct
taste. - -
The influence of rank & situation
assisted his views - the [deletion]age[/deletion] [insertion]public[/insertion] was
prepared to receive them; &
He was enabled to devellope
his opinions with full confidence
that they would be adopted

[deletion]Before the time of [person]person_124|Bacon[/person][/deletion]
[deletion]the the field of Natural Knowledge[/deletion]
[deletion]was a bar[/deletion]
[deletion] - That which [insertion]in knowledge[/insertion] had been a barren[/deletion]

more distinct than in the advancement
of Geology & Chemistry; though
much labour had been bestowed upon
these extensive [underline]fields[/underline] of [underline]investigation[/underline]
they had hitherto [insertion]as we have seen[/insertion] been little
productive. Speculation had been
misplaced, observation confined
& [underline]experiment[/underline] [deletion]directed[/deletion] [insertion]principally[/insertion]
directed rather towards [underline]impossible[/underline]
than to [underline]practicable[/underline] things. -
- In the [underline]novel system hypothesis[/underline]
was exploded except as a guide
[underline]to actual trials[/underline] - Combinations
of thoughts were considered as
truths only when [deletion][unclear]they were[/unclear][/deletion]

- One of the first persons who applied

after enlightened [underline]views[/underline] & distinct

degree of talent . - His Genius
was however too powerful & too
active to be limited to any
one pursuit, & in the course

[page]34|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00034|dnpgs62_032pp|100776354[/page]
of his scientific [underline]career[/underline]. He applied
his [underline]great abilities[/underline] to almost
all the principal objects of
investigation in [underline]Natural Science[/underline].
- In Chemistry He develloped
with a rapid yet penetrating
[underline]view[/underline] the general [underline]History[/underline] of
[underline]combustion[/underline]; And His [deletion]Geological[/deletion]
Hypothesis of Earthquakes & Volcanoes
is scarcely exceeded by any of
the refinements [insertion]of theory in[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion] modern times. -
Few Men have done more than
[person]person_246|Hooke[/person] [deletion]yet few men are[/deletion] [insertion]& few have been more neglected[/insertion]
[deletion][underline]more less known many men[/underline][/deletion]
[deletion]who have [insertion]done[/insertion] effected less are[/deletion]
[deletion]much more known[/deletion] & one
of the principal reasons [deletion]of his[/deletion]
[deletion]circumstances[/deletion] is that He was

[page]35|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00035|dnpgs62_033pp|100776355[/page]
the contemporary of [person]person_036|Newton[/person], whose
just Glory & whose splendid discoveries
covering the great Laws of the
Universe absorbed the attention
of the philosophers of the
age & made them almost
regardless of inferior [underline]inventions[/underline].
[deletion][person]person_246|Hooke[/person][/deletion] in the [underline]geological speculations[/underline]
which were published after his death
[deletion]posthumous[/deletion], assuming as a fact
the [underline]existence[/underline] of [underline]shells & the[/underline]
remains of [underline]marine[/underline] animals
in rocks & in hills of
[underline]considerable elevation[/underline] draws
the conclusion, that these strata
must have been at some period
covered by the sea: |_& after reasoning

[page]36|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00036|dnpgs62_034pp|100776356[/page]
upon the general [underline]effects of earthquakes[/underline].
& of [underline]volcanic explosions[/underline] He infers
that there are no causes in
Nature more probable than
these for the elevation of land
of [deletion]mountain[/deletion] rocks & of mountains
from the Bosom of the waters.
-. He brings forward many
chemical instances to shew
that [underline]water[/underline] [insertion]is capable[/insertion] of dissolving & of
depositing stoney matter &
that its agency is fully
adequate to the formation
of strata; |_& He shews that
both in modern & in ancient
times several [deletion]instances[/deletion] [insertion]cases[/insertion] have
occured [deletion]&[/deletion] of islands & of
tracts of Land, rising out of

[page]37|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00037|dnpgs62_035pp|100776357[/page]
the sea in consequence of submarine
Volcanoes. -
- The ideas of [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] are conceived
with boldness & develloped with
precision. In many [deletion]points[/deletion] principal
parts of Theory He had anticipated
the modern [misc]misc_100|plutonic[/misc] Philosophers;
He seems however to have
restrained his imagination. He
has contented himself with
demonstrating a certain part
of the [insertion]existing[/insertion] order of Nature
without attempting a general
system of the past changes
of the globe & of its
future destiny. -
- [person]person_387|[underline]Beccher[/underline][/person] lived at the same
period as [person]person_246|Hooke[/person]; like [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] He
devoted his life to Science; but He

[page]38|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00038|dnpgs62_036pp|100776358[/page]
selected one department & directed
to Geological Chemistry, the
whole of the powers of his
Mind.
In his book called subterranean
Philosophy published in Latin in 1669
He has given some very beautiful
details with regard to the mineral
Kingdom & has offered views of
theory perfectly new - His ideas
concerning combination & decomposition
are of the most accurate nature
His notion of an inflammable principle
formed the foundation of the
Hypothesis of [person]person_388|Stahl[/person] - He gave
to chemical Philosophy new
dominions & new instruments of
investigation & He attempted

[page]39|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00039|dnpgs62_037pp|100776359[/page]
to form a general theory in
which all the operations of
Nature should be explained &
illustrated by experiments of
human invention. -
.- Beccher with the sound judgment
of a true Philosopher assumes
a certain primary order of
things resulting from the creation
of the Globe & He applies
his reasonings only to the solution
of the phaenomena of the changes
which have since [underline]taken place[/underline].
- [underline]Water [deletion]&[/deletion] in the mineral[/underline] Kingdom
& elastic vapours He considers
as the great agents which
have altered the position of
strata & the direction of metallic

[page]40|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00040|dnpgs62_038pp|100776360[/page]
veins & from the decomposition
of certain rocks by these natural
agents He supposes that new
ones have been formed of a
much [underline]softer nature[/underline] & fitted
to become soils, & to support
vegetable life. -
Beccher was born at Spire
in 1645. He was for some
time professor of medicine in [place]place_1128|Bavaria[/place]
but He was driven from [place]place_324|Germany[/place]
by envy & persecution - [place]place_121|England[/place]
became his adopted country.
He was patronized by the
great [underline][person]person_103|Boyle[/person][/underline] [insertion]in consequence of[/insertion] [deletion]by[/deletion] whose liberality
He was enabled to study mineralogy
in [place]place_021|cornwal[/place], to pursue his
experimental researches & [deletion]the[/deletion] to

[page]41|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00041|dnpgs62_039pp|100776361[/page]
produce [insertion]some of[/insertion] those works in [deletion]Geology[/deletion] [insertion]Natural[/insertion]
Science, which will always confer
honour on his name. -
- [person]person_246|Hooke[/person] & Beccher had contented
themselves with [underline]partial views[/underline], |_&
the celebrated [person]person_1005|[underline]Leibnitz[/underline][/person] is the first
Philosopher who attempted a [underline]general[/underline]
[underline]system[/underline] of [underline]Geology[/underline]. - In his
[otherwork]otherwork_318|[underline]protogea[/underline][/otherwork] [deletion]supposed to have been[/deletion] [insertion]published in 1693[/insertion]
[deletion]written in 1693[/deletion] He enters upon
the [underline]great doctrines[/underline] relating to
[underline]the Globe[/underline]; the [underline]primary[/underline] creation,
[underline]the deluge[/underline] the changes that
have been [insertion]since[/insertion] produced [deletion]since[/deletion] &
that will be produced in [underline]future[/underline]
[underline]Ages[/underline]. -
- He assumes as the foundation of
his [underline]reasoning[/underline] the account of the creation
given in the [underline]sacred writings[/underline].

[page]42|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00042|dnpgs62_040pp|100776362[/page]
And He attempts to shew that the
Globe at its [deletion]creation[/deletion] [insertion]origin[/insertion] must have
existed in a state of [insertion]igneous[/insertion] fusion [insertion][deletion]fire[/deletion][/insertion], in
consequence of which it assumed
its [underline]spherical form[/underline]; The heavier
substances such as the metals
He supposes to have [deletion]been[/deletion] occupied
[deletion][unclear]first deposited afterward[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]the centre & He conceives that the[/insertion]
rocks which chrystalized [deletion]&[/deletion]
[deletion]which though[/deletion] at first in
regular strata were afterwards
broken [insertion]& raised into mountains[/insertion] by explosions taking
place from [deletion]the centre[/deletion] [insertion]beneath[/insertion] & [deletion]the[/deletion]
chasms produced & filled with
metallic veins. -
The water which at first
existed in [insertion]highly rarified[/insertion] vapor He supposed
to have been by degrees
condensed & from its action
in its heated state upon the

[page]43|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00043|dnpgs62_041pp|100776363[/page]
Land He [deletion]supposes[/deletion] [insertion]conceives[/insertion] that a part
of the surface was decomposed
broken down & converted into
a soil, on which by the Almighty
fiat vegetables & animals were
made to exist & the whole
cloaked with beauty [underline]& rendered[/underline]
[underline]subservient[/underline] to the purposes
of [underline]the last[/underline] [insertion]created[/insertion] &[underline]most perfect[/underline] of
[deletion]creature[/deletion] [underline]beings. -[/underline]
-. [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] supposes that there
may have been two causes
for the [underline]Deluge[/underline];- The elevation
of Land in the former bed
of the Ocean in consequence
of explosions from the central
ignited mass & [underline]the passage[/underline]
[underline]of the tail of a[/underline] comet

[page]44|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00044|dnpgs62_042pp|100776364[/page]
[underline]through the Atmosphere loaded[/underline]
[underline]with [chemical]chemical_503|aqueous vapour[/chemical][/underline]. By the
first cause He explains the passage
in Genesis "The fountains of
the great deep were broken up"
& by the second , [insertion]the other sentence[/insertion] "the windows
of heaven were opened & the rain
was upon the Earth for forty
days & forty nights-"
- [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] supposes that the principal
changes which have taken place
Since [underline]the deluge[/underline] have depended
either upon volcanic fires;
or great inundations from
the Ocean; & He [deletion]supposes[/deletion] conceives
that fire & water are [deletion]great[/deletion]
counterballancing powers, by
which an order of things

[page]45|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00045|dnpgs62_043pp|100776365[/page]
similar to the present will be
maintained till the great
& general [underline]conflagration[/underline] [deletion]predicted[/deletion]
[deletion]in the Scriptures shall take[/deletion]
[deletion]place.[/deletion]
- [underline]Such[/underline] is the doctrine of
the [otherwork]otherwork_318|protogea[/otherwork] as found in the
[insertion]excellent[/insertion] [underline]edition[/underline] of the works of [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person]
by [person]person_1061|[underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dutens[/underline][/person].- [deletion]It is marked[/deletion]
[deletion]in every part by the Genius[/deletion]
[deletion]of the illustrious Author -[/deletion]
The work itself is in the highest
degree [deletion]worthy[/deletion] [insertion]deserving[/insertion] of a minute
examination - It is worthy of
the Genius of the illustrios
Author;- When facts are
stated in it they are detailed
with clearness & accuracy; & where

[page]46|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00046|dnpgs62_044pp|100776366[/page]
Hypotheses are indulged in; they
mark an imagination fertile
in novelty & pregnant with
bold conceptions.-
[deletion]From this treatise many[/deletion]
[deletion]of the moderns[/deletion]
That his [underline]reasoning is not always[/underline]
convincing rather depends upon
his endeavoring to solve [deletion]problems[/deletion]
problems concerning which there
are no data than upon any
imperfection in his methods -
The subject which He has undertaken
[underline]to discuss[/underline] is one almost above
the powers of the Human Mind,
It required high talents to produce
any philosophical views with regard
to it & [deletion]which[/deletion] the abilities

[page]47|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00047|dnpgs62_045pp|100776367[/page]
of [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] [insertion]where they[/insertion] have not develloped actual
[underline]truth[/underline]; [deletion]they[/deletion] have [insertion]uniformally[/insertion] [deletion]always[/deletion] produced
some [deletion]semblance[/deletion] brilliant resemblance
to reality
in which the [underline]fancy[/underline] [insertion][deletion]always[/deletion][/insertion] & [underline]sometimes[/underline]
even the [underline]reason[/underline] can dwell with
delight. -
[deletion]Many[/deletion] The [otherwork]otherwork_318|protogea[/otherwork] has been
[deletion]work[/deletion] very little known, but many
writers appear to have borrowed
from it. - [person]person_519|[underline]Whiston[/underline][/person] [deletion]seems to have[/deletion] [insertion]adopted[/insertion]
[deletion]derived from it his[/deletion] the idea
of a comet having produced
the deluge; & has endeavoured
to prove it from mathematical
[underline]deductions[/underline] - His treatise is however
very much inferior in precision
to that of the prussian
Philosopher & contains no ideas

[page]48|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00048|dnpgs62_046pp|100776368[/page]
remarkable either for thought
or novelty. -
Another [deletion]Theory[/deletion] [insertion]system[/insertion] which appeared
about the same time as that
of [person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person] has excited infinitely
more attention in [place]place_159|Britain[/place]
I mean the [otherwork]otherwork_319|Sacred Theory of[line]the Earth[/otherwork] by [person]person_1001|D[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline]Burnet[/underline][/person]
- In this [insertion]work[/insertion] [deletion]sacred Theory production[/deletion]
the globe is supposed to have
been created without irregularities
[underline]perfectly spherical[/underline] & smooth having
neither hills mountains or vallies -
|_ The land is supposed to have
been equally diffused above
the Ocean & to have covered
it in a thin crust; &

[page]49|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00049|dnpgs62_047pp|100776369[/page]
the deluge is considered as having
been occasioned by the breaking
down of the land into the
great abyss beneath an [deletion]of[/deletion] event
which [deletion]hear[/deletion] [insertion]He supposes to have[/insertion] produced all
the [deletion]irregularities[/deletion] varieties of sea
& Earth that at present exist
the [deletion]production[/deletion] [insertion]formation[/insertion] of islands &
the great [underline]elevation of continents.[/underline]
- - [deletion]The Theory[/deletion]
Burnet paints with all
the feeling of [insertion]an enthusiast[/insertion] [deletion]a [unclear]Poet[/unclear][/deletion] the
[underline]delightful state[/underline] of the [insertion]inhabitants of the[/insertion] Globe
before the deluge, [insertion]in his hypotheses[/insertion] [deletion]which having[/deletion]
as there could have been
no variety of seasons He
conceives [insertion]that they[/insertion] must have [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] enjoyed
a [underline]perpetual[/underline] spring; that the
face of Heaven & the sun &

[page]50|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00050|dnpgs62_048pp|100776370[/page]
the stars must have been
[deletion]long have[/deletion] exhibited to them in unclouded
beauty; And that the whole
of earth must have been
green with [insertion]perpetual[/insertion] vegetation. [deletion]& covered[/deletion]
[deletion]with life[/deletion] -.
Burnet saw none of the
[underline]errors of his system[/underline] - He did
not [deletion]recollect[/deletion] [insertion]perceive[/insertion] that without the
[insertion]action of the[/insertion] waters of the sea [insertion]upon the atmosphere[/insertion] there could
be no [deletion][/deletion] rain no dews no
rivers & consequently no plants
[deletion]vegetation[/deletion]; & no animal life
- His mode of accounting for
the [deletion]watering[/deletion] [insertion]moistening[/insertion] of the earth [insertion]by the filtration of water[/insertion] [deletion]in[/deletion]
through the solid matter & its elevation into the air
[underline]perfectly inadmissable[/underline] &
every one must allow that
the feelings & taste of the

[page]51|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00051|dnpgs62_049pp|100776371[/page]
[misc]misc_853|Antediluvians[/misc] must have been
very different from ours if
they could derive more pleasure
from the contemplation of a
flat surface & an uniform sky
than from the view of the
variety of hill & dale [deletion]&[/deletion]
of mountain & river scenery
& the ever varying [deletion]face[/deletion] [insertion]appearances[/insertion] of
[deletion]heavens[/deletion] [insertion]of clouds. -[/insertion]
[person]person_1062|[underline]D[superscript]r[/superscript] Keil[/underline][/person] in his [underline]examination of[/underline]
[otherwork]otherwork_320|the [underline]sacred Theory[/underline] has distinctly proved[/otherwork]
that it is wholly incompatible
with the general laws of the Globe.
& not conformable in the slightest degree
to facts _ |_ its a poetical Romance
It is highly interesting & entertaining
but as a philosophical opinion
it is wholly unworthy of attention
& it affords one proof amongst many
others of the folly of attempts to wrest the meaning of
the sacred writings which [deletion]are intended to[/deletion] express
general truths [deletion][unclear]only[/unclear][/deletion] so as to make them serve as supports

[page]52|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00052|dnpgs62_050pp|100776372[/page]
for hypothesis of human invention, so as blend them
with the visions & fancies of Men. -
- |_ The last system which I shall mention
in this lecture is that of [person]person_266|[underline]Buffon[/underline][/person]. -
[deletion]& it is[/deletion] One of the most singular
& extraordinary productions of
the human Mind; beauties &
deflects are blended in it
& it is complete with ingenuity
& with error. -
- [person]person_266|Buffons[/person] idea of the primary
state of the Globe is wholly
borrowed from [underline][person]person_1005|Leibnitz[/person][/underline]- He conceives
it to have existed in igneous
fusion; but despising the modest
opinion of the Author of the
[otherwork]otherwork_318|protogea[/otherwork] that such was its
[underline]primary creation[/underline] - He supposes
it to have been produced
from the Ruins of another

[page]53|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00053|dnpgs62_051pp|100776373[/page]
[underline]system[/underline] to have been carried off
from the Sun by the powerful
impulse of a comet & to
have been moved into its
present [deletion]situation[/deletion] [insertion]orbit[/insertion] by projections
& the force of gravity. -
-. He [deletion]places[/deletion] [insertion]fixes[/insertion], the era at
which this great event is
supposed to have taken place
at a distance of time
quite inconceiveable: |_ & He
imagines [deletion]seven[/deletion] [insertion]three[/insertion] [underline]different[/underline] epochs
[deletion]eras[/deletion] in [underline]the history[/underline] of
[underline]the cooling[/underline] of the surface
[underline]before [deletion]the[/deletion] Marine Animals[/underline]
existed; & five epochs before
it was fitted for the

[page]54|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00054|dnpgs62_052pp|100776374[/page]
residence of [deletion]Land[/deletion] Land Animals
& of Man. -
- [person]person_266|Buffon[/person] brings forward two
principal arguments in the support
of his hypothesis; & they are
now both known to be founded
upon false principles. -
- The first is that the
temperature of the Earth is
found higher the farther
we penetrate [insertion]beneath[/insertion] [deletion]into[/deletion] the surface.
- The second is that the
surface of the earth is
composed of matters which
are almost all capable of
being [chemical]chemical_509|vitrified by Heat[/chemical]

[page]55|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00055|dnpgs62_053pp|100776375[/page]
[deletion]It is well ascertained[/deletion]
- Now it is well ascertained
that except in [underline]volcanic countries[/underline]
the temperature of the earth
at a considerable depth is
[deletion]m[/deletion] the mean temperature of
[underline]the atmosphere[/underline]; & that it
varies according to that mean
in all the different climates,
so that it is evidently [deletion]is[/deletion] produced
not by internal but by
external causes, [deletion]by[/deletion] not by a
central fire but by the solar
rays & the Heat of the
[underline]Air[/underline] .-
With regard to the other
proposition it is certain that
the greater number of [underline]our Rocks[/underline]

[page]56|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00056|dnpgs62_054pp|100776376[/page]

we have no right to make

an expression of conjecture
but an arrangement of facts.
- The ideas of [person]person_266|Buffon[/person] concerning
the changes of the Globe that are
now taking place & the general
order [underline]of nature[/underline] are scarcely less
bold or less visionary than his

[page]57|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00057|dnpgs62_055pp|100776377[/page]
notions concerning the origin of things
- He conceives that the Land & the
Sea are continually changing places; that
from the action [deletion]of the water of the[/deletion]
[deletion]Atmosphere[/deletion] of rains of rivers & of torrents
the solid matter of the land is constantly
divided decomposed & [deletion]carried into[/deletion] [insertion]deposited in[/insertion] the
[underline]Ocean[/underline]. In which [deletion]it is[/deletion] carried by
currents towards the equator [insertion]it is again[/insertion] accumulated
in strata & formed by the
power of aqueous consolidation into
new rocks & new mountains
which rise at length above the
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] waves & offer a due compensation
for the destruction of parts of
ancient continents & islands.-
- This Hypothesis in which the Waters
of the atmosphere are supposed to be the destroying
cause & the waters of the sea the
regenerating cause of [underline]the solid land[/underline], is
supported by the Author with considerable
address, [deletion]& Genius[/deletion] [insertion]& ingenuity [deletion]& eloquence[/deletion][/insertion] - He endeavors to

[page]58|MS-DAVY-00602-000-00058|dnpgs62_056pp|100776378[/page]
prove from the [deletion]marine[/deletion] [insertion]shells &[/insertion] remains [insertion]of fishes[/insertion] found
in some parts of [deletion]the highest[/deletion] [insertion]high[/insertion] mountains.
that the present continents [deletion]&[/deletion]
[deletion]islands[/deletion] must have been formed
in the bed of the Ocean. -
-..- He endeavors to show that
some of the islands under the
equator have been very lately
raised - And He brings forward
many accurate instances which
demonstrate that the sea has
gained upon the land to some
extent in many different parts
of Europe. -
- I shall not at present enter
upon a full discussion of these opinions for
they will again occupy our attention
in the examination of a much
more comprehensive & more artfully
constructed Theory that of [person]person_125|D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton[/person]
I shall merely offer a [deletion]few very [insertion]general observation[/insertion][/deletion] few

[insertion]very general[/insertion] [deletion]couple[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]to the hypothesis of Hook._[/deletion][/insertion] observations [deletion]from them[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]ask which will equally apply[/deletion]upon them[/insertion] .-
- With regard to the idea that
our present land was formed in the
bosom of the sea by the mere action
of water, it is one that may
be controverted & overturned with
care. - The greatest portion of
our high rocks & elevated mountains
are chrytalized masses, containing
no organic remains & not
arranged in layers |_ & they consist
of matter wholly incapable
of being consolidated by water
Such is [chemical]chemical_092|Granite[/chemical] which formes
a considerable part of the
[place]place_247|Alps[/place]; which constitutes the
great mountains of [place]place_235|Scotland[/place]
& the Hills [insertion]& cliffs[/insertion] of [place]place_021|cornwal[/place]. -
Instance
- And stratified rocks even which
[deletion]seem[/deletion] seem themselves to have been
deposited by water are often blended

with rocks of another descriptions
[underline]Instance[/underline]
so as rather to indicate a great
inundation & [insertion]rapid[/insertion] transit of the [deletion]waters[/deletion]
ocean over the [underline]land[/underline] than a gradual
& [underline]quiet deposition[/underline] of the solid matter
of the earth in the bed of the sea -
-. It is impossible to doubt [deletion]but[/deletion]
that in the lapse of ages some
slight diminution of our mountains
& land must take place from the
[underline]agency of rivers[/underline]; but there are
many causes in Nature which
appear to counteract the effect
Forty [deletion]thousand years[/deletion] [insertion]centuries nearly[/insertion] have passed
away & no natural change
in the form of the solid matter
of the Globe has taken place [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]in consequence[/insertion]
this agency; |_From the most accurate
[deletion]calculation[/deletion] [insertion]obseration it appears[/insertion] nearly a [deletion]thousand[/deletion] [insertion]hundred[/insertion] years

as this [insertion]like that which portrait[/insertion] represents or of Mont Blanc
would be lost & with regard
to [insertion]the ultimate termination of[/insertion] such effects it is almost
ridiculous to reason seriously
[deletion]to their ultimate termination[/deletion]
|_ Man attached to the globe
has [deletion]limited faculties[/deletion] a limited
sphere of action, limited faculties
& but a short period for the
employment of them-. [deletion]To[/deletion] He was
not intended to waste his
time in guesses concerning
what is to take place in
infinite duration; but [insertion]He was rather born[/insertion] to reason
from the past & the present
concerning his immediate probable
destinies & in philosophy as
well as in [underline]common life[/underline] [insertion]He ought[/insertion] only to
be guided [deletion]by strong analogies[/deletion] by

- To conclude, after censuring [person]person_266|M. Buffons[/person]
wilder speculations it would be unfair
to deny to him the highest
praise for order [insertion]of arrangement in his [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] work[/insertion] splendor of
description, & brilliancy of style -
-. He has [deletion]cloaked[/deletion] [insertion]adorned[/insertion] a subject
of the most abstracted kind
in the refined charms &
elegancies of literature & He
has [deletion]given[/deletion] bestowed on [insertion]it[/insertion] [deletion]a sea[/deletion]
an [deletion][unclear]high[/unclear][/deletion] interest which it
[deletion]&[/deletion] an [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] interest which it
had never possessed before

transcendent - there is nothing [unclear][deletion]great[/deletion][/unclear] [insertion][deletion]highly admirable[/deletion][/insertion]

But to clothe the [insertion]dull & dead[/insertion] objects of
a speculative branch of Science
in the forms of beauty & to

can accomplish; & it is
a work in which [person]person_266|Buffon[/person]
has perfectly succeeded. -
