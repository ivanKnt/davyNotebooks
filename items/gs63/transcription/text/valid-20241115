Geology.
[underline]Lecture. 4[superscript]th[/superscript] 1805.[/underline]
- It has often happened during
the progress of Science that two
doctrines immediately opposite have
been supported with great powers of
reasoning & almost with equal plausibility.
Such a circumstance however
almost always marks with the infancy
of the study & the imperfection
of the methods of investigation.
It proves that speculation merely
has been employed or partial
facts only examined: And the
Philosophical enquirer in opposing
supposition to supposition & error
to error will instantly perceive
[unclear][/unclear]

[page]4|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00004|dnpgs63_002pp|100776387[/page]
the insufficiency of either class of
opinions; & will thus preserve
the mind free from doubt, from
the prejudice of false systems,
& from mistake & confusion.
- This method may be [deletion]often[/deletion] [insertion]sometimes[/insertion]
applied with great success in
the examination of Geological
theories. - It [deletion]sometimes[/deletion] removes the
necessity of strict discussion &
it often devellopes absurdity without
the assistance of laborious logical
deductions.
[underline]Buffon[/underline] in his Theory of
the Globe, supposes that the
surface is constantly becoming
[underline]colder[/underline]. M. de Maillet on the

[page]5|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00005|dnpgs63_003pp|100776388[/page]
other hand conceives that it is daily growing
warmer. The first attempts to prove
that [deletion]the[/deletion] ice in the course of ages
will [underline]extend[/underline] even to the [deletion]line[/deletion] [insertion]countries under the tropics[/insertion] Whilst
the last conceives that in no
very distant period it will
[underline]disappear[/underline] even from the poles.
The one Author [unclear]xxxxx[/unclear] that [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion] unless
[insertion]the energies of Man are capable of opposing the laws of Nature[/insertion] our cultivated lands will become [deletion][unclear]converted[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]into[/deletion] snow clad plains; & the
other dreads [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] their conversion
into burning desarts of sand, [unclear]xxx[/unclear]
incapable of supporting vegetable
life. -
It is scarcely possible to imagine
two Hypotheses in [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] more
perfect opposition; both have [insertion]been[/insertion] defended
with ingenuity, both are founded
upon mistakes. The one may
be ballanced against the other

[page]6|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00006|dnpgs63_004pp|100776389[/page]
there will be scarcely a perceptible
difference in their weight &
importance; & they may safely
be given up together. -
- The [underline]work[/underline] of M. de Maillet
[insertion]in geology[/insertion] is called [underline]Telliamed[/underline] which is
an anagram of his name,
a translation of it appeared
in English in 1750. -
- The Author professes to devellope
the opinions of an [underline]Indian[/underline] philosopher
whom He had met at Cairo
when the Consul General of France
in that City. - (Though He intended
to produce a philosophical theory
He has given it in the form
of a Romance; & it may be
safely said to contain the
matter of a [underline]Romance[/underline], for

[page]7|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00007|dnpgs63_005pp|100776390[/page]
the fables are [deletion]much[/deletion] more numerous
than the facts; & it affords
much entertainment but little
or no instruction. -
- M. de Maillet from having
observed an increase of Land
on several parts of the coast
of the Mediterranean conceives
that there must be an uniform
law of diminution of [underline]the Sea[/underline]
in consequence of which
the whole surface must
at length become dry land.
- His opinion is very similar to
that ancient one of [underline]Leucippus[/underline].
And He further supposes that
the whole of the Globe in
early ages was covered with

[page]8|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00008|dnpgs63_006pp|100776391[/page]
water; & that from the slow
 & gradual [deletion]diminution[/deletion] [insertion]disappearance[/insertion] of the
[underline]Ocean[/underline] [underline]Our[/underline] present islands
& continents have been formed,
& the existing order of things
produced. -
- I have mentioned this hypothesis
because it is the foundation
of the idea of the gradually
increasing temperature of the
[underline]Land[/underline]: for M. de Maillet
justly conceives that if [underline]Water[/underline]
disappears; [underline]Fire[/underline] must accumulate,
& that the [underline]dry surface[/underline] must
soon become inhabitable.
- All his observations of facts
[insertion]however[/insertion] are partial & his notion of
the [unclear][underline]dissipation[/underline][/unclear] of the moisture

[page]9|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00009|dnpgs63_007pp|100776392[/page]
of our globe into space shews
a total ignorance of the laws
of [underline]evaporation[/underline] which long before
the time of the publication
of his [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] work had been fully
developed by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Halley. -
- This excellent Philosopher
has proved from the most accurate
[underline]data[/underline] that the fluid raised from
the ocean & the surface of
earth in consequence of the
solar Heat is condensed by cold
in the upper regions of the
Air. & that from its deposition,
clouds are produced & dew
& rain - which [insertion][deletion]either[/deletion][/insertion] water the
earth & support vegetable &
 animal life, & form [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]rivers, that[/insertion] return

[page]10|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00010|dnpgs63_008pp|100776393[/page]
the superfluous [deletion]water[/deletion] moisture
[deletion]by rivers[/deletion] into the sea, its
[underline]present source[/underline]. - [deletion]In[/deletion] According
to this beautiful system the
[underline]foundations[/underline] of which [underline]are distinct[/underline]
[underline]truths[/underline], "there is a constant
circulation of moisture upon
our globe [deletion]& a constant application[/deletion]
[deletion]of it to the purpose of[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]living beings,[/underline][/deletion] no portion
[deletion]of it[/deletion] rises above the atmosphere
no portion is lost: & amidst
a variety of combinations
& [underline]decompositions[/underline], the equilibrium
is preserved the quantity
is unimpaired; & there is
a constant application of it
to the [deletion]purposes[/deletion] [insertion]uses[/insertion] of living Beings.

[page]11|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00011|dnpgs63_009pp|100776394[/page]
(- Most of the important errors
in the [insertion]early geological[/insertion] systems of the moderns
[deletion]last two centuries[/deletion] may [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] indeed
be referred to a want of
acquaintance in their Authors
with the great facts belonging
to the order of Nature; &
to an ignorance of the
[underline]real[/underline] essence of the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]subterraneous[/insertion]
[underline]Kingdom[/underline] - ([underline]Chemistry[/underline]&
[underline]Mineralogy[/underline] till the middle
of the last century were
merely in the embryon state
without [deletion]order [insertion]harmony[/insertion] arrangement[/deletion]
order or beauty: (& [underline]they[/underline]
offer the only true & permanent
foundations on which a just

[page]12|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00012|dnpgs63_010pp|100776395[/page]
Theory of the earth can be erected.
(Not even the genius of a
Beccher or a Hooke, not
even the [deletion]imagination of[/deletion]
[deletion]a Buffon[/deletion] minutely enquiring
spirit of a Woodward nor
the imagination of a [unclear]Buffon[/unclear]
could supply the want of
an extended system of
[underline]experimental[/underline] knowledge, (&
it was not till chemical
analysis had discovered
the real composition of
Mineral bodies & [deletion]the laws[/deletion]
[deletion]of their changes[/deletion] given accuracy
to the [underline]systems[/underline] of classification,

[page]13|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00013|dnpgs63_011pp|100776396[/page]
It was not till this period
that the changes [deletion]at present[/deletion]
taking place in the surface of
the Globe in the present time
could be accurately acertained;
or any true analogical evidences
gained of the [insertion]intimate nature of the[/insertion] revolutions
which had occurred in
past ages. -
- One of the first persons
[underline]who endeavored[/underline] to employ [insertion]real[/insertion] mineralogical
& chemical knowledge in the
[underline]solution[/underline] of the most remarkable
appearances of the surface of
the Globe was the late
M[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline]Whitehurst. [deletion]of Derby[/deletion][/underline]
(His [deletion]Theory of the[/deletion] Enquiry into
the state & formation of the
Earth was published in 1778,

[page]14|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00014|dnpgs63_012pp|100776397[/page]
about the period when some
of the most brilliant discoveries
ever made with regard to
intimate nature of bodies were
brought to light by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley & M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Bergman. -
Whitehurst [deletion]seen[/deletion] was evidently
[underline]gifted,[/underline] with [underline]an indifatigable[/underline]
[underline]spirit of investigation[/underline] similar
to that which actuated these
[deletion]illustrious[/deletion] celebrated Men; (& his labours
though directed towards objects
much more obscure & more difficulty
attainable have been highly
meritorious & productive of
important results. -
Whitehurst passed the early

[page]15|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00015|dnpgs63_013pp|100776398[/page]
part of his life in Derbyshire;
(And it was from an observation
of the many interesting phaenomena
of the Mineral Kingdom
which occur upon a great
scale in [underline]that[/underline] County, that
He was first induced to
direct his attention to Geology
not so much as He himself
informs us with the view of
constructing a Theory as with
the hope of obtaining such a
competent knowledge of subterraneous
Geography as might be applicable
to useful purposes & to
discoveries in [underline]Mining[/underline]. -
- His attention was however
soon arested by a fact which

[page]16|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00016|dnpgs63_014pp|100776399[/page]
it was scarcely possible for
an active Mind to notice
without in dulging in speculation
without reasoning from effects
concerning causes. -
- The principal [deletion]Rocks[/deletion] strata
in Derbyshire are sandstone,
slate, coal, & limestone in
some cases they are parallel
[deletion]& right[/deletion] [insertion]to the[/insertion] horizon & regular
in their disposition; but
in other cases they are
considerably broken & inclined.
- [deletion]In[/deletion] In some districts of
the county a substance is
found called by the miners
[underline]toadstone[/underline] which is in fact

[page]17|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00017|dnpgs63_015pp|100776400[/page]
a species of Basalt & where
this rock occurs in the greatest
[underline]quantity[/underline] the stratified masses.
are usually found most deranged
& confused in their position. -
- Sketches of sections of the
[underline]strata[/underline] will perhaps illustrate
the History & a simple glance
of the eye will be more
convincing than the most
minute description.
[underline]Instances[/underline]
- It was in examining this curious
phaenomena that Whitehurst
was led to form the
conclusion of the [underline]connection[/underline]

[page]18|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00018|dnpgs63_016pp|100776401[/page]
of the dis order of the strata
with the presence of the
[underline]toad stone;[/underline] & finding
that this rock was lower
than the others & that
no metallic veins existed
in it & that even
the veins of the limestone
when intersected by it
appeared in the opposite
[underline]sides[/underline], He concluded that
the strata were of prior
formation & that this
[underline]substance[/underline] had been interfused
amongst them in a liquid
state by some great convulsion
of Nature, which had produced

[page]19|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00019|dnpgs63_017pp|100776402[/page]
chasms capable of receiving it
& which had broken & dislodged
the [underline]sandstone[/underline], [underline]slate, & limestone.[/underline]
(- The toadstone of Derbyshire
& the lava of Vesuvius & Etna
are very similar in many of
their external properties - This
resemblance did not escape Whitehurst
& it afforded him new ideas
& new analogies - ( Lava
is certainly formed by the
action of Heat upon Rocks
concealed in the very bosom
of the earth; (& it immediately
occured to our Author that
toadstone must have had a
similar origin (& when He
had conceived this, his explanation

[page]20|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00020|dnpgs63_018pp|100776403[/page]
appeared compleat; - for it was
easy to conceive that the
same Volcanic fire which
produced the ignited & liquid
mass, would be fully adequate
to the [underline]derangement[/underline] of the
strata, to the separation of
veins & to the formation
of caverns in the superincumbent
mass. -
- All the facts seemed
to combine, all were subservient
to one [underline]demonstration[/underline] (Fully
satisfied with the truth of
his [deletion]first[/deletion] [insertion]early[/insertion] speculations with
their apparent conformity
to Nature; Whitehurst did

[page]21|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00021|dnpgs63_019pp|100776404[/page]
not long suffer his imagination
to rest [underline]upon the[/underline] first aspect
of things; new objects of discussion
arose, new elucidations of them;
& partial Theory gradually led
to general Hypothesis. -
- That of the stratified rocks
of Derbyshire contain shells
or the remains of marine
[underline]Animals[/underline]; - In considering this
circumstance. Whitehurst was
led to form the conclusion
almost common to [deletion]all[/deletion] scientific
Men that they had been
[deletion][unclear]found[/unclear] at[/deletion] [insertion]covered[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] by the sea: - (And
He immediately connected
the cause of the [underline]deluge[/underline]

[page]22|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00022|dnpgs63_020pp|100776405[/page]
With their [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]present elevation,[/underline]
supposing [insertion][deletion]with Hooke[/deletion][/insertion] that they had been
raised from the bottom of
the [deletion]Sea[/deletion] [insertion]Ocean[/insertion] by the same
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] fires which He
conceived to have produced
their irregularities. -
[deletion]Whitehurst He seems to be[/deletion]
[deletion]have been unacquainted with[/deletion]
[deletion]the [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear] of [unclear]Hooke xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]of his [unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear] are similar[/deletion]
[deletion]but they are always more[/deletion]
[deletion]minute, & more dependent[/deletion]
[deletion]on [unclear]facts[/unclear] -[/deletion]
During the rise of new
continents & islands [insertion]assumed to have taken place[/insertion] [deletion]from[/deletion]
[deletion]the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of the Waters, it[/deletion]

[page]23|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00023|dnpgs63_021pp|100776406[/page]
necessarily follows; that the Waters
[deletion]acess[insertion]land at waters[/insertion][/deletion] must have flowed
in upon the lands already
[underline]existing[/underline]. And from so
great a change in the
surface the Author conceives
that an alteration in the
centre of gravity of the
earth must have occurred
& [underline]that[/underline] in consequence, at
this period its axis may
have gained its [insertion]present[/insertion] inclination
to the plane of its orbit.
Such appears to have
been the progress of the
Mind of the philosopher
of Derby in his investigations.

[page]24|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00024|dnpgs63_022pp|100776407[/page]
though in his work the
results are stated in a
different order; |_ His reasonings
were evidently all deduced from
[underline]particular[/underline] facts; but in [deletion]taking[/deletion]
[insertion]develloping[/insertion] his system he commences with
the [deletion]statement[/deletion] [insertion]statement[/insertion] of general
[underline]principles[/underline] & [deletion]after[/deletion] He afterward
applies them to [deletion]particulars[/deletion] the
[underline]phaenomena[/underline]. It will
not be essential [deletion]to[/deletion] in
our present enquiry to
follow him [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] minutely
through the mere suppositions
& extended parts of his
theory in which He reasons
concerning the creation of the

[page]25|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00025|dnpgs63_023pp|100776408[/page]
original state of the Globe.
a few words will sufficiently
explain [underline]his notions .[/underline]
[deletion]Reasoning in[/deletion] Guided by the Newtonian law
of gravitation, he ascertained that
[deletion]supposing[/deletion] [insertion]conceiving [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] the earth to have
been created as a fluid or
soft mass, it must have assumed
in [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]becoming solid[/insertion] the form which
at present belongs to it, that
of an oblate spheroid flattened at
the poles.
He supposes it [deletion]originally[/deletion]
to have been covered with
water & peopled with marine
Animals immediately after
the creation; & He conjectures
that [deletion]the Land forms[/deletion] island

[page]26|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00026|dnpgs63_024pp|100776409[/page]
were gradually formed in the
great ocean in consequence
of the action of waves &
[underline]currents[/underline] which islands He [deletion]conjectures[/deletion]
[deletion]supposes[/deletion] [insertion]considers as[/insertion] [deletion]the dwell men[/deletion]
the abode of the antediluvian
race of Men.
He supposes [insertion]like Burnet[/insertion] that before
the deluge the axis of the
earth was [deletion]parallel[/deletion] [insertion]perpendicular[/insertion] to
the [insertion]plane of its orbit[/insertion] orbit, & consequently
that there was no variety
of seasons & that days &
[underline]nights were[/underline] equal upon every
[underline]part of[/underline] the surface. -
- In his work a plate

[page]27|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00027|dnpgs63_025pp|100776410[/page]
is given of [insertion][deletion]a section of[/deletion][/insertion] the [deletion]supposed[/deletion] [insertion]imaginary[/insertion] form
of the [underline]primitive islands[/underline] raised
at a gentle elevation from
the sea - this design represents
[underline]the section[/underline]
These islands the fancy
of Whitehurst has [deletion]imagined[/deletion] [insertion]pictured[/insertion]
as abounding with all the
earliest productions of [underline]Nature[/underline]
as equally free from excess
of Heat or cold & as
adapted in the best possible
manner for the enjoyment
of a [deletion]llfe[/deletion] life extended
far beyond the present limits
of human existence & devoted
[deletion]to[/deletion] to infinite [insertion]& refined[/insertion] pleasures & to

[page]28|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00028|dnpgs63_026pp|100776411[/page]
pure & innocent delights. -
- |_ If any [insertion]new[/insertion] arguments were wanting
to prove the insufficiency of
human reason [deletion]to[/deletion] in its attempt
at [underline]remote [deletion]conjecture[/deletion][/underline] [insertion]supposition[/insertion]; of its
inability to account [insertion]minutely[/insertion] for the
primeval state of things, they
might be derived from
this conjectural History of
the first periods of globe.
- Whenever Whitehurst is
directed by the arrangement
of [underline]facts[/underline] his ideas are
always [deletion]probable & ingenious[/deletion] [insertion]accurate & philosophical[/insertion]
but when he enters the field
of wild speculation his opinions

[page]29|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00029|dnpgs63_027pp|100776412[/page]
are [deletion]still less visionary than[/deletion] [insertion]almost as visionary as those[/insertion]
[deletion]those[/deletion] those of the [insertion]elder[/insertion] theorists
[deletion]of India & of Greece - His[/deletion]
This [deletion]His[/deletion] Account of the [underline]strata[/underline]
of Derbyshire offers an admirable
specimen of acute observation
& plausible induction. It
is one of the earliest & one
of the most perfect of true
geological sketches. - On the
[insertion]contrary[/insertion] his theories of primitive
islands & of the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]perpendicularity[/insertion]
of the axis [insertion]& orbit[/insertion] of the earth
[deletion]appear at first view simple[/deletion]
[deletion]& [underline]ingenious[/underline] on the contrary[/deletion]
are mere [deletion]dreams[/deletion] ingenious
[underline]dreams[/underline]. |_ He endeavors indeed

[page]30|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00030|dnpgs63_028pp|100776413[/page]
to show their conformity
reason & to sacred History
but [underline]without success[/underline]; And [insertion]even[/insertion] allowing
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]his [deletion]every reason to believe[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]obvious[/deletion] [insertion]conjectures[/insertion] [deletion]that.[/deletion] If the
land had [deletion]was[/deletion] been distributed wholly
in islands over the ocean
& if there were no changes
of seasons [insertion]there is great reason to believe that[/insertion] the general temperature
of the globe would be lower
that it is at the present
time. For the oblique rays
of the Sun in the [deletion]day of[/deletion] period
twelve hours could scarcely
possess any effect [deletion]of[/deletion] upon the
poles; ice [deletion]would[/deletion] in consequence
would [insertion]probably[/insertion] be continually
[underline]accumulating[/underline], there would

[page]31|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00031|dnpgs63_029pp|100776414[/page]
be no extensive winds which are
[deletion]can only be[/deletion] produced only by
the ascent of columns
of Air from heated tracts
of [underline]land[/underline] of considerable extent
& which are necessary [underline]for[/underline]
blending the parts of the
atmosphere together & for
equalizating their temperature
- The lower strata of the Air
would in consequence soon become
impure & unfit for the purpose
of life - |_ And in these ideas
allowing the Hypothesis the
Antediluvians instead of being gently warmed
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] by a perpetual summer would
have been chilled by the frosts
of an eternal winter - Instead of

[page]32|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00032|dnpgs63_030pp|100776415[/page]
breathing a purer & more etherial
fluid; they would have been
exposed to an Atmosphere [deletion]of[/deletion] filled
with noxious & suffocating vapors.
Animated Nature would have fallen
rapidly into decay; & there would
have been no established principle
of reproduction similar to that
which exists in the present
intelligent & harmonious order of
things. -
[deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc like Whitehurst[/deletion]
[deletion]has supposed that at the creation[/deletion]
[deletion]the axis of the earth was[/deletion]
[deletion]parallel axis to the place of[/deletion]
[deletion]its orbit But He conjectures[/deletion]
[deletion]that it contained continents[/deletion]
[deletion]of greater extent than those[/deletion]

[page]33|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00033|dnpgs63_031pp|100776416[/page]
[deletion]that at present exist[/deletion]
- The system of Mr De Luc as it
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]first[/insertion] made its appearance in
1779 embraces a smaller number
of objects than that of Whitehurst
but his discussion are more minute
& his observations more general &
extensive - Whitehurst examined
with attention the facts that
were presented to him; but his
sphere of observation was unfortunately
limited to a particular district
& He was unacquainted with the
greatest & most important of
the [underline]mountain chains[/underline] belonging to
the globe. M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Luc a native
of Switzerland from his infancy
had been accustomed to the
contemplation of the magnificent

[page]34|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00034|dnpgs63_032pp|100776417[/page]
Rock scenery of [underline]the Alps[/underline];- He
studied [deletion]them with attention[/deletion] these
[deletion]& was enabled to[/deletion] great &
interesting masses with attention
& was enabled to compare
the geological phaenomena presented
by them with similar
phaenomena in Germany, France
& England. - In his [insertion]letters to the Queen[/insertion] [deletion][uncelar]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] facts
are recorded with a truly
philosophical spirit; & His
Hypotheses are [insertion]generally[/insertion] [underline]advanced[/underline] with
[underline]diffidence[/underline] & [underline]defended[/underline] with
moderation & candour. -
-. [underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript]. de Luc[/underline] commences
his enqueries [insertion]concerning Theory[/insertion] [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]at[/insertion] the Mosaic
account of the Creation;

[page]35|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00035|dnpgs63_033pp|100776418[/page]
He assumes a certain [deletion]for[/deletion] arrangement
of things which He [deletion]considers[/deletion] [insertion]calls[/insertion]
[deletion]as[/deletion] [underline]primordial[/underline]; [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion] which He
considers as resulting from the
immediate will of the Almighty.
- He supposes that the
surface of the Globe at
its first formation contained
a number of irregular &
extensive caverns which were
[deletion]equally diffused[/deletion] [insertion]equally extended[/insertion] [underline]beneath[/underline] the
bed of the ocean [underline]& below[/underline]
the [underline]islands & continents[/underline]. -
- He refers the deluge to
the destruction of these caverns
by subterraneous fires & He

[page]36|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00036|dnpgs63_034pp|100776419[/page]
supposes that at the time

at least answered the important

D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton however [deletion]who[/deletion] in [deletion]all[/deletion]
cases when He has borrowed
materials has given to them
a new & more philosophical

all the parts are well adapted
[underline]to each other[/underline], & though it
is easy to doubt of the
truth of the system it is
scarcely possible not to admire
the order & ingenuity with
which it is contrived.-

D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton attempts to support his
system by [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]numerous[/insertion] appeals to [deletion]existing facts[/deletion] observation

have become deeper & in which

[underline]elevation[/underline] of [deletion]the island of[/deletion] various
islands in the midst of the
Ocean by [underline]submarine Volcanoes .-[/underline]
And assuming the production of
[underline]Basalt by fire[/underline], He attempts
to shew that there exists a
strong analogy between this substance
[underline]& Granite[/underline] , & that the [deletion]basalt[/deletion] mixture
[underline]of Basalt with[/underline] the Rocks containing
organic remains bears a strong
analogy to the intersection of

of the [underline]primordial[/underline] or [underline]primitive[/underline] rocks
by [underline]veins[/underline] of granite.-
- The two Theories that have been
most opposed to that of D[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline]Hutton[/underline]
have been the invention of
Professor [underline]Werner[/underline] & M[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline]Kirwan[/underline] .-
In the [underline]Geognosy[/underline] of "[underline]Werner[/underline]"
Water is made the great
Agent [deletion]of[/deletion] [underline]both[/underline] [deletion]for[/deletion] of decomposition
[underline]& of formation[/underline] .- -
[underline]Werner conceives[/underline] that in the
beginning of things, all the existing
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxx xx xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]substances composing[/insertion] the globe were
in a state of solution by
[underline]the aqueous fluid;[/underline]- And He

of [deletion]at[/deletion] chemical attraction & in consequence
of the polarity of [deletion][unclear]thxxx[/unclear][/deletion] the particles;
they assumed the forms that
at present belong to them.-
- The Rocks that are called
[underline]primordial or primitive[/underline] & [deletion]He [unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] that contains
no organic remains, He supposes
the first to have been deposited
from [underline]the original[/underline] aqueous solution.
& He considers them as the result
of [underline]chrystalization[/underline]; & of an arrangement
of matter in which all attractive
powers were duly opposed to each other.
-. After [underline]the first[/underline] production of
[underline]Rocks[/underline] from the dissolving [underline]fluid[/underline]
He supposes; counterballancing affinities
in consequence of which certain
substances before dissolved were
[underline]thrown down[/underline] [deletion]but[/deletion] not in the

[underline]chrystalized form[/underline] but rather in a
state of mechanical division
& from their mixture with
the substances of primitive
[deletion]or[/deletion] [underline]formation[/underline] He supposes a [underline]new[/underline]
class of rocks which [unclear][deletion]xxxx[/deletion][/unclear] He
calls the [underline]transitional[/underline] [deletion]class[/deletion] [insertion]Rocks[/insertion] to
have been formed.-
At the period of the deposition
of the transitional Rocks, Werner supposes
the Ocean to have been peopled
with living beings & hence He
accounts for the shells & [deletion]remains[/deletion] [insertion]genera[/insertion]
of Marine Animals [underline]existing[/underline] in them.
|_ The last Epoch in his 'geognosy'
is the production of the secondary
or highly stratified [insertion]masses[/insertion] [deletion]mountains[/deletion] containing
in [underline]almost all their parts organic remains[/underline]

Geology.
[underline]Lecture. 4[superscript]th[/superscript] 1805.[/underline]
- It has often happened during
the progress of Science that two
doctrines immediately opposite have
been supported with great powers of
reasoning & almost with equal plausibility.
Such a circumstance however
almost always marks with the infancy
of the study & the imperfection
of the methods of investigation.
It proves that speculation merely
has been employed or partial
facts only examined: And the
Philosophical enquirer in opposing
supposition to supposition & error
to error will instantly perceive

[page]4|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00004|dnpgs63_002pp|100776387[/page]
the insufficiency of either class of
opinions; & will thus preserve
the mind free from doubt, from
the prejudice of false systems,
& from mistake & confusion.
- This method may be [deletion]often[/deletion] [insertion]sometimes[/insertion]
applied with great success in
the examination of Geological
theories. - It [deletion]sometimes[/deletion] removes the
necessity of strict discussion &
it often devellopes absurdity without
the assistance of laborious logical
deductions.
[underline]Buffon[/underline] in his Theory of
the Globe, supposes that the
surface is constantly becoming
[underline]colder[/underline]. M. de Maillet on the

[page]5|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00005|dnpgs63_003pp|100776388[/page]
other hand conceives that it is daily growing
warmer. The first attempts to prove
that [deletion]the[/deletion] ice in the course of ages
will [underline]extend[/underline] even to the [deletion]line[/deletion] [insertion]countries under the tropics[/insertion] Whilst
the last conceives that in no
very [deletion]long[/deletion] distant period it will
[underline]disappear[/underline] even from the poles.
The one Author fears that [deletion]our[/deletion] unless
[insertion]the energies of Man are capable of opposing the laws of Nature[/insertion] our cultivated lands will become [deletion][unclear]converted[/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]into[/deletion] snow clad plains; & the
other dreads [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] their conversion
into burning desarts of sand, [deletion][unclear]xxx[/unclear][/deletion]
incapable of supporting vegetable
life. -
It is scarcely possible to imagine
two Hypotheses in [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] more
perfect opposition; both have [insertion]been[/insertion] defended
with ingenuity, both are founded
upon mistakes. The one may
be ballanced against the other

[page]6|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00006|dnpgs63_004pp|100776389[/page]
there will be scarcely a perceptible
difference in their weight &
importance; & they may safely
be given up together. -
- The [underline]work[/underline] of M. de Maillet
[insertion]in geology[/insertion] is called [underline]Telliamed[/underline] which is
an anagram of his name,
a translation of it appeared
in English in 1750. -
- The Author professes to devellope
the opinions of an [underline]Indian[/underline] philosopher
whom He had met at Cairo
when the Consul General of France
in that City. - |_ Though He intended
to produce a philosophical theory
He has given it in the form
of a Romance; & it may be
safely said to contain the
matter of a [underline]Romance[/underline], for

[page]7|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00007|dnpgs63_005pp|100776390[/page]
the fables are [deletion]much[/deletion] more numerous
than the facts; & it affords
much entertainment but little
or no instruction. -
- M. de Maillet from having
observed an increase of Land
on several parts of the coast
of the Mediterranean conceives
that there must be an uniform
law of diminution of [underline]the Sea[/underline]
in consequence of which
the whole surface must
at length become dry land.
- His opinion is very similar to
that ancient one of [underline]Leucippus[/underline].
And He further supposes that
the whole of the Globe in
early ages was covered with

[page]8|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00008|dnpgs63_006pp|100776391[/page]
water; & that from the slow
 & gradual [deletion]diminution[/deletion] [insertion]disappearance[/insertion] of the
[underline]Ocean[/underline] [underline]our[/underline] present islands
& continents have been formed,
& the existing order of things
produced. -
- I have mentioned this hypothesis
because it is the foundation
of the idea of the gradually
increasing temperature of the
[underline]Land[/underline]: for M. de Maillet
justly conceives that if [underline]Water[/underline]
disappears; [underline]Fire[/underline] must accumulate,
& that the [underline]dry surface[/underline] must
soon become inhabitable.
- All his observations of facts
[insertion]however[/insertion] are partial & his notion of
the [unclear][underline]dissipation[/underline][/unclear] of the moisture

[page]9|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00009|dnpgs63_007pp|100776392[/page]
of our globe into space shews
a total ignorance of the laws
of [underline]evaporation[/underline] which long before
the time of the publication
of his [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] work had been fully
developed by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Halley. -
- This excellent Philosopher
has proved from the most accurate
[underline]data[/underline] that the fluid raised from
the ocean & the surface of
earth in consequence of the
solar Heat is condensed by cold
in the upper regions of the
Air. & that from its deposition,
clouds are produced & dew
& rain - which [insertion][deletion]either[/deletion][/insertion] water the
earth & support vegetable &
 animal life, & form [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]rivers, that[/insertion] return

[page]10|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00010|dnpgs63_008pp|100776393[/page]
the superfluous [deletion]water[/deletion] moisture
[deletion]by rivers[/deletion] into the sea, its
[underline]present source[/underline]. - [deletion]In[/deletion] According
to this beautiful system the
[underline]foundations[/underline] of which [underline]are distinct[/underline]
[underline]truths[/underline], "there is a constant
circulation of moisture upon
our globe [deletion]& a constant application[/deletion]
[deletion]of it to the purpose of[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]living beings,[/underline][/deletion] no portion
[deletion]of it[/deletion] rises above the atmosphere
no portion is lost: & amidst
a variety of combinations
& [underline]decompositions[/underline], the equilibrium
is preserved the quantity
is unimpaired; & there is
a constant application of it
to the [deletion]purposes[/deletion] [insertion]uses[/insertion] of living Beings.

[page]11|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00011|dnpgs63_009pp|100776394[/page]
|_ - Most of the important errors
in the [insertion]early geological[/insertion] systems of the moderns
[deletion]last two centuries[/deletion] may [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] indeed
be referred to a want of
acquaintance in their Authors
with the great facts belonging
to the order of Nature; &
to an ignorance of the
[underline]real[/underline] essence of the [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]subterraneous[/insertion]
[underline]Kingdom[/underline] - |_ [underline]Chemistry[/underline]&
[underline]Mineralogy[/underline] till the middle
of the last century were
merely in the embryon state
without [deletion]order [insertion]harmony[/insertion] arrangement[/deletion]
order or beauty: |_ & [underline]they[/underline]
offer the only true & permanent
foundations on which a just

[page]12|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00012|dnpgs63_010pp|100776395[/page]
theory of the earth can be erected.
|_ Not even the genius of a
Beccher or a Hooke, not
even the [deletion]imagination of[/deletion]
[deletion]a Buffon[/deletion] minutely enquiring
spirit of a Woodward nor
the imagination of a [unclear]Buffon[/unclear]
could supply the want of
an extended system of
[underline]experimental[/underline] knowledge, (&
it was not till chemical
analysis had discovered
the real composition of
Mineral bodies & [deletion]the laws[/deletion]
[deletion]of their changes[/deletion] given accuracy
to the [underline]systems[/underline] of classification,

[page]13|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00013|dnpgs63_011pp|100776396[/page]
It was not till this period
that the changes [deletion]at present[/deletion]
taking place in the surface of
the Globe in the present time
could be accurately acertained;
or any true analogical evidences
gained of the [insertion]intimate nature of the[/insertion] revolutions
which had occurred in
past ages. -
- One of the first persons
[underline]who endeavored[/underline] to employ [insertion]real[/insertion] mineralogical
& chemical knowledge in the
[underline]solution[/underline] of the most remarkable
appearances of the surface of
the Globe was the late
M[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline] Whitehurst. [deletion]of Derby[/deletion][/underline]
|_ His [deletion]Theory of the[/deletion] Enquiry into
the state & formation of the
Earth was published in 1778,

[page]14|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00014|dnpgs63_012pp|100776397[/page]
about the period when some
of the most brilliant discoveries
ever made with regard to
intimate nature of bodies were
brought to light by D[superscript]r[/superscript] Black
M[superscript]r[/superscript] Cavendish D[superscript]r[/superscript] Priestley & M[superscript]r[/superscript]
Bergman. -
Whitehurst [deletion]seen[/deletion] was evidently
[underline]gifted,[/underline] with [underline]an indifatigable[/underline]
[underline]spirit of investigation[/underline] similar
to that which actuated these
[deletion]illustrious[/deletion] celebrated Men; |_ & his labours
though directed towards objects
much more obscure & more difficulty
attainable have been highly
meritorious & productive of
important results. -
Whitehurst passed the early

[page]15|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00015|dnpgs63_013pp|100776398[/page]
part of his life in Derbyshire;
|_ And it was from an observation
of the many interesting phaenomena
of the Mineral Kingdom
which occur upon a great
scale in [underline]that[/underline] County, that
He was first induced to
direct his attention to Geology
not so much as He himself
informs us with the view of
constructing a Theory as with
the hope of obtaining such a
competent knowledge of subterraneous
Geography as might be applicable
to useful purposes & to
discoveries in [underline]Mining[/underline]. -
- His attention was however
soon arested by a fact which

[page]16|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00016|dnpgs63_014pp|100776399[/page]
it was scarcely possible for
an active Mind to notice
without in dulging in speculation
without reasoning from effects
concerning causes. -
- The principal [deletion]Rocks[/deletion] strata
in Derbyshire are sandstone,
slate, coal, & limestone in
some cases they are parallel
[deletion]& right[/deletion] [insertion]to the[/insertion] horizon & regular
in their disposition; but
in other cases they are
considerably broken & inclined.
- [deletion]In[/deletion] In some districts of
the county a substance is
found called by the miners
[underline]toadstone[/underline] which is in fact

[page]17|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00017|dnpgs63_015pp|100776400[/page]
a species of Basalt & where
this rock occurs in the greatest
[underline]quantity[/underline] the stratified masses.
are usually found most deranged
& confused in their position. -
- Sketches of sections of the
[underline]strata[/underline] will perhaps illustrate
the History & a simple glance
of the eye will be more
convincing than the most
minute description.
[underline]Instances[/underline]
- It was in examining this curious
phaenomena that Whitehurst
was led to form the
conclusion of the [underline]connection[/underline]

[page]18|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00018|dnpgs63_016pp|100776401[/page]
of the dis order of the strata
with the presence of the
[underline]toad stone;[/underline] & finding
that this rock was lower
than the others & that
no metallic veins existed
in it & that even
the veins of the limestone
when intersected by it
appeared in the opposite
[underline]sides[/underline], He concluded that
the strata were of prior
formation & that this
[underline]substance[/underline] had been interfused
amongst them in a liquid
state by some great convulsion
of Nature, which had produced

[page]19|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00019|dnpgs63_017pp|100776402[/page]
chasms capable of receiving it
& which had broken & dislodged
the [underline]sandstone[/underline], [underline]slate, & limestone.[/underline]
|_- The toadstone of Derbyshire
& the lava of Vesuvius & Etna
are very similar in many of
their external properties - This
resemblance did not escape Whitehurst
& it afforded him new ideas
& new analogies - |_ Lava
is certainly formed by the
action of Heat upon Rocks
concealed in the very bosom
of the earth; |_ & it immediately
occured to our Author that
toadstone must have had a
similar origin |_ & when He
had conceived this, his explanation

[page]20|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00020|dnpgs63_018pp|100776403[/page]
appeared compleat; - for it was
easy to conceive that the
same Volcanic fire which
produced the ignited & liquid
mass, would be fully adequate
to the [underline]derangement[/underline] of the
strata, to the separation of
veins & to the formation
of caverns in the superincumbent
mass. -
- All the facts seemed
to combine, all were subservient
to one [underline]demonstration[/underline] |_ Fully
satisfied with the truth of
his [deletion]first[/deletion] [insertion]early[/insertion] speculations with
their apparent conformity
to Nature; Whitehurst did

[page]21|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00021|dnpgs63_019pp|100776404[/page]
not long suffer his imagination
to rest [underline]upon the[/underline] first aspect
of things; new objects of discussion
arose, new elucidations of them;
& partial Theory gradually led
to general Hypothesis. -
- That of the stratified rocks
of Derbyshire contain shells
or the remains of marine
[underline]Animals[/underline]; - In considering this
circumstance. Whitehurst was
led to form the conclusion
almost common to [deletion]all[/deletion] scientific
Men that they had been
[deletion][unclear]found[/unclear] at[/deletion] [insertion]covered[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] by the sea: - |_ And
He immediately connected
the cause of the [underline]deluge[/underline]

[page]22|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00022|dnpgs63_020pp|100776405[/page]
With their [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]present elevation,[/underline]
supposing [insertion][deletion]with Hooke[/deletion][/insertion] that they had been
raised from the bottom of
the [deletion]Sea[/deletion] [insertion]Ocean[/insertion] by the same
[deletion]submarine[/deletion] fires which He
conceived to have [deletion]given[/deletion] produced
their irregularities. -
[deletion]Whitehurst He seems to be[/deletion]
[deletion]have been unacquainted with[/deletion]
[deletion]the hypothesis of Hooke some[/deletion]
[deletion]of his reasonings are similar[/deletion]
[deletion]but they are always more[/deletion]
[deletion]minute, & more dependent[/deletion]
[deletion]on [unclear]facts[/unclear] -[/deletion]
During the rise of new
continents & islands [insertion]assumed to have taken place[/insertion] [deletion]from[/deletion]
[deletion]the [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] of the Waters[/deletion], it

[page]23|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00023|dnpgs63_021pp|100776406[/page]
necessarily follows; that the Waters
[deletion]acess[insertion]land at waters[/insertion][/deletion] must have flowed
in upon the lands already
[underline]existing[/underline]. And from so
great a change in the
surface the Author conceives
that an alteration in the
centre of gravity of the
earth must have occurred
& [underline]that[/underline] in consequence, at
this period its axis may
have gained its [insertion]present[/insertion] inclination
to the plane of its orbit.
- - Such appears to have
been the progress of the
Mind of the philosopher
of Derby in his investigations. _|

[page]24|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00024|dnpgs63_022pp|100776407[/page]
though in his work the
results are stated in a
different order; |_ His reasonings
were evidently all deduced from
[underline]particular facts[/underline]; but in [deletion]taking[/deletion]
[insertion]develloping[/insertion] his system he commences with
the [deletion]statement[/deletion] [insertion]statement[/insertion] [underline]of general[/underline]
[underline]principles[/underline] & [deletion]after[/deletion] He afterward
applies them to [deletion]particulars[/deletion] the
[underline]phaenomena[/underline]. |_ It will
not be essential [deletion]to[/deletion] in
our present enquiry to
follow him [deletion][unclear]xxxx xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] minutely
through the mere suppositions
& extended parts of his
theory in which He reasons
concerning the creation of the

[page]25|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00025|dnpgs63_023pp|100776408[/page]
original state of the Globe.
a few words will sufficiently
explain [underline]his notions .[/underline]
[deletion]Reasoning in[/deletion] Guided by the [underline]Newtonian law[/underline]
of gravitation, he ascertained that
[deletion]supposing[/deletion] [insertion]conceiving [deletion][unclear]ascertaining[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] the earth to have
been created as a fluid or
soft mass, it must have assumed
in [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]becoming solid[/insertion] the form which
at present belongs to it, that
of an oblate spheroid flattened at
the poles.
He supposes it [deletion]originally[/deletion]
to have been covered with
water & peopled with marine
[underline]Animals[/underline] immediately after
the creation; & He conjectures
that [deletion]the Land forms[/deletion] island

[page]26|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00026|dnpgs63_024pp|100776409[/page]
were gradually formed in the
great ocean in consequence
of the action of waves &
[underline]currents[/underline] which islands He [deletion]conjectures[/deletion]
[deletion]supposes[/deletion] [insertion]considers as[/insertion] [deletion]to [unclear]xxxx[/unclear] men[/deletion]
the abode of the antediluvian
race of Men.
He supposes [insertion]like Burnet[/insertion] that before
the deluge the axis of the
earth was [deletion]parallel[/deletion] [insertion]perpendicular[/insertion] to
the [insertion]plane of its orbit[/insertion] orbit, & consequently
that there was no variety
of seasons & that days &
[underline]nights were[/underline] equal upon every
[underline]part of[/underline] the surface. -
- In his work a plate

[page]27|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00027|dnpgs63_025pp|100776410[/page]
is given of [insertion][deletion]a section of[/deletion][/insertion] the [deletion]supposed[/deletion] [insertion]imaginary[/insertion] form
of the [underline]primitive islands[/underline] raised
at a gentle elevation from
the sea - this design represents
[underline]the section[/underline]
These islands the fancy
of Whitehurst has [deletion]imagined[/deletion] [insertion]pictured[/insertion]
as abounding with all the
earliest productions of [underline]Nature[/underline]
as equally free from excess
of Heat or cold & as
adapted in the best possible
manner for the enjoyment
of a [deletion]llfe[/deletion] life extended
far beyond the present limits
of human existence & devoted
[deletion]to[/deletion] to infinite [insertion]& refined[/insertion] pleasures & to

[page]28|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00028|dnpgs63_026pp|100776411[/page]
pure & innocent delights. -
- |_ If any [insertion]new[/insertion] arguments were wanting
to prove the insufficiency of
human reason [deletion]to[/deletion] in its attempt
at [underline]remote [deletion]conjecture[/deletion][/underline] [insertion]supposition[/insertion]; of its
inability to account [insertion]minutely[/insertion] for the
primeval state of things, they
might be derived from
this conjectural History of
the first periods of globe.
- Whenever Whitehurst is
directed by the arrangement
of [underline]facts[/underline] his ideas are
always [deletion]probable & ingenious[/deletion] [insertion]accurate & philosophical[/insertion]
but when he enters the field
of wild speculation his opinions

[page]29|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00029|dnpgs63_027pp|100776412[/page]
are [deletion]still less visionary than[/deletion] [insertion]almost as visionary as those[/insertion]
[deletion]those[/deletion] those of the [insertion]elder[/insertion] theorists
[deletion]of India & of Greece - His[/deletion]
His [deletion]His[/deletion] Account of the [underline]strata[/underline]
of Derbyshire offers an admirable
specimen of acute observation
& plausible induction. It
is one of the earliest & one
of the most perfect of true
geological sketches. - On the
[insertion]contrary[/insertion] his theories of primitive
islands & of the [deletion]parallelism[/deletion] [insertion]perpendicularity[/insertion]
of the axis [insertion]& orbit[/insertion] of the earth
[deletion]appear at first view simple[/deletion]
[deletion]& [underline]ingenious[/underline] on the contrary[/deletion]
are mere [deletion]dreams[/deletion] ingenious
[underline]dreams[/underline]. |_ He endeavors indeed

[page]30|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00030|dnpgs63_028pp|100776413[/page]
to show their conformity to
reason & to sacred History
but [underline]without success[/underline]; And [insertion]even[/insertion] allowing
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]his [deletion]every reason to believe[/deletion][/insertion] [deletion]obvious[/deletion] [insertion]conjectures[/insertion] [deletion]that.[/deletion] If the
land had [deletion]was[/deletion] been distributed wholly
in islands over the ocean
& if there were no changes
of seasons [insertion]there is great reason to believe that[/insertion] the general temperature
of the globe would be lower
that it is at the present
time. For the oblique rays
of the Sun in the [deletion]day of[/deletion] period
twelve hours could scarcely
possess any effect [deletion]of[/deletion] upon the
poles; ice [deletion]would[/deletion] in consequence
would [insertion]probably[/insertion] be continually
[underline]accumulating[/underline], there would

[page]31|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00031|dnpgs63_029pp|100776414[/page]
be no extensive winds which are
[deletion]can only be[/deletion] produced only by
the ascent of columns
of Air from heated tracts
of [underline]land[/underline] of considerable extent
& which are necessary [underline]for[/underline]
blending the parts of the
atmosphere together & for
equalizating their temperature
- The lower strata of the Air
would in consequence soon become
impure & unfit for the purpose
of life - |_ And in these ideas
allowing the Hypothesis the
Antediluvians instead of being gently warmed
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] by a perpetual summer would
have been chilled by the frosts
of an eternal winter - Instead of

[page]32|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00032|dnpgs63_030pp|100776415[/page]
breathing a purer & more etherial
fluid; they would have been
exposed to an Atmosphere [deletion]of[/deletion] filled
with noxious & suffocating vapors.
Animated Nature would have fallen
rapidly into decay; & there would
have been no established principle
of reproduction similar to that
which exists in the present
intelligent & harmonious order of
things. -
[deletion]M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc like Whitehurst[/deletion]
[deletion]has supposed that at the creation[/deletion]
[deletion]the axis of the earth was[/deletion]
[deletion]parallel axis to the plane of[/deletion]
[deletion]its orbit But He conjectures[/deletion]
[deletion]that it contained continents[/deletion]
[deletion]of greater extent than those[/deletion]

[page]33|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00033|dnpgs63_031pp|100776416[/page]
[deletion]that at present exist[/deletion]
- The system of M[superscript]r[/superscript] De Luc as it
[deletion][unclear]then[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]first[/insertion] made its appearance in
1779 embraces a smaller number
of objects than that of Whitehurst
but his discussion are more minute
& his observations more general &
extensive - Whitehurst examined
with attention the facts that
were presented to him; but his
sphere of observation was unfortunately
limited to a particular district
& He was unacquainted with the
greatest & most important of
the [underline]mountain chains[/underline] belonging to
the globe. M[superscript]r[/superscript] de Luc a native
of Switzerland from his infancy
had been accustomed to the
contemplation of the magnificent

[page]34|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00034|dnpgs63_032pp|100776417[/page]
Rock scenery of [underline]the Alps[/underline];- He
studied [deletion]them with attention[/deletion] these
[deletion]& was enabled to[/deletion] great &
interesting masses with attention
& was enabled to compare
the geological phaenomena presented
by them with similar
phaenomena in Germany, France
& England. - In his [insertion]letters to the Queen[/insertion] [deletion][unclear]works[/unclear][/deletion] facts
are recorded with a truly
philosophical spirit; & His

considers as resulting from the

a number of irregular &
extensive caverns which were

supposes that at the time

The Theory of the Earth of

at least answered the important
end of keeping the public
interest alive to the facts
& discoveries of the Science. -
- Many of the elements of it
[deletion]the Huttonian Theory[/deletion] may be
found in the writings of
preceding Authors, [deletion]but particularly[/deletion]
in those of [deletion]Buffon[/deletion] [insertion]Hooke[/insertion] of Buffon,
& [insertion]particularly of[/insertion] [underline]Lazaro Moro[/underline] who supposed
all mountains to have been
formed by Volcanic eruptions -
D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton however [deletion]who[/deletion] in [deletion]all[/deletion]
cases when He has borrowed
materials has given to them
a new & more philosophical
arrangement; [deletion]&[/deletion] He has combined
them in such a manner
with the result of his own

observations & his own reflections
as to form a whole in which
all the parts are well adapted
[underline]to each other[/underline], & though it
is easy to doubt of the
truth of the system it is
scarcely possible not to admire
the order & ingenuity with
which it is contrived.-
- Dr. Hutton reasoning like
[underline]Buffon[/underline] conceives [deletion]that in the[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]lapse of ages[/underline][/deletion] that the agency of
[deletion]the water[/deletion] the atmosphere & of
[underline]water[/underline] must [deletion]cause our[/deletion] [insertion]occasion[/insertion] the
mountains of the Earth [deletion]to[/deletion] constantly
to diminish; & He supposes
that a time must arrive in
the lapse of ages when all

the solid land [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]which[/insertion] constitutes
our present continents & islands
must be wholly destroyed
by the agency of rivers &
carried into the depths of
[underline]the Ocean[/underline]. -
- From such a cause He [deletion]allows[/deletion] [insertion]shews[/insertion]
that the order of Nature must
be wholly destroyed, if there did
not exist another cause capable
of renovating the land & of
opposing the agency of [underline]Water[/underline].
. This cause He considers
[deletion]to the [unclear]xxxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]as fire[/underline] acting
under the pressure of the sea

to prove that in the

D[superscript]r[/superscript] Hutton attempts to support his
system by [deletion]an[/deletion] [insertion]numerous[/insertion] appeals to [deletion]existing facts[/deletion] observation
& to experience .- He quotes a
[deletion]number[/deletion] [insertion]variety[/insertion] of [underline]instances[/underline] in which rocks
have been observed to diminish,
[deletion]into the[/deletion] , in which the beds of rivers
have become deeper & in which
the ocean has gained upon [underline]the land[/underline].
- He details the [underline]History[/underline] of the
[underline]elevation[/underline] of [deletion]the island of[/deletion] various
islands in the midst of the
Ocean by [underline]submarine Volcanoes .-[/underline]
And assuming the production of
[underline]Basalt by fire[/underline], He attempts
to shew that there exists a
strong analogy between this substance
[underline]& Granite[/underline] , & that the [deletion]basalt[/deletion] mixture
[underline]of Basalt with[/underline] the Rocks containing
organic remains bears a strong
analogy to the intersection of

[page]48|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00048|dnpgs63_046pp|100776431[/page]
of the [underline]primordial[/underline] or [underline]primitive[/underline] rocks
by [underline]veins[/underline] of granite.-
- The two Theories that have been
most opposed to that of D[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline]Hutton[/underline]
have been the invention of
Professor [underline]Werner[/underline] & M[superscript]r[/superscript] [underline]Kirwan[/underline] .-
In the [underline]Geognosy[/underline] of "[underline]Werner[/underline]"
Water is made the great
Agent [deletion]of[/deletion] [underline]both[/underline] [deletion]for[/deletion] of decomposition
[underline]& of formation[/underline] .- -
[underline]Werner conceives[/underline] that in the
beginning of things, all the existing
[deletion][unclear]xxxxx xxx xx xx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]substances composing[/insertion] the globe were
in a state of solution by
[underline]the aqueous fluid;[/underline]- And He
assumes, that in consequence of the laws

of [deletion]at[/deletion] chemical attraction & in consequence
of the polarity of the particles;
they assumed the forms that
at present belong to them.-
- The Rocks that are called
[underline]primordial or primitive[/underline] & [deletion]He [unclear]con[/unclear][/deletion] that contains
no organic remains, He supposes
the first to have been deposited
from [underline]the original[/underline] aqueous solution.
& He considers them as the result
of [underline]chrystalization[/underline]; & of an arrangement
of matter in which all attractive
powers were duly opposed to each other.
-. After [underline]the first[/underline] production of
[underline]Rocks[/underline] from the dissolving [underline]fluid[/underline]
[underline]He supposes[/underline]; counterballancing affinities
in consequence of which certain
substances [underline]before dissolved[/underline] were
[underline]thrown down[/underline] [deletion]but[/deletion] not in the

[page]50|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00050|dnpgs63_048pp|100776433[/page]
[underline]chrystalized form[/underline] but rather in a
state of mechanical division
& from their mixture with
the substances of primitive
[deletion]or[/deletion] [underline]formation[/underline] He supposes a [underline]new[/underline]
class of rocks [deletion]namely[/deletion] which He
calls the [underline]transitional[/underline] [deletion]class[/deletion] [insertion]Rocks[/insertion] to
have been formed.-
At the period of the deposition
of the transitional Rocks, Werner supposes
the Ocean to have been peopled
with living beings & hence He
accounts for the shells & [deletion]remains[/deletion] [insertion]genera[/insertion]
of Marine Animals [underline]existing[/underline] in them.
|_ The last Epoch in his 'geognosy'
is the [underline]production[/underline] of the secondary
or highly stratified [insertion]masses[/insertion] [deletion]mountains[/deletion] containing
in [underline]almost all their parts organic remains[/underline]
|_ & these He conjectures to have been

[page]51|MS-DAVY-00603-000-00051|dnpgs63_049pp|100776434[/page]
[underline]produced[/underline] wholly by the [underline]mechanical[/underline]

materials which had [underline]been suspended[/underline]
in [underline]the ocean[/underline] & which the

[underline]M[superscript]r[/superscript] Kirwan[/underline] in his geological
essays has in many cases followed
principles of reasoning similar to

has supposed an universal [insertion]aqueous[/insertion] solution
