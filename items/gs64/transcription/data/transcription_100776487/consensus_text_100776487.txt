- [underline]Pit coal[/underline] is [deletion]uniformly[/deletion] [insertion]always[/insertion] found
[underline]in secondary countries[/underline] - Its basis
is the same substance as charcoal
but it is usually impregnated
with [underline]Bitumen[/underline]; which is the part
of the [underline]coal[/underline] that fuses, [deltion]that[/deletion]
[deletion]produces[/deletion] [insertion]occasions[/insertion] caking; & that [underline]emits[/underline]
the vapour which produces [underline]flame[/underline].
- Coals differ very much according
as they contain different preparations
of fixed coaly matter & of [underline]Bitumen[/underline]
And they are often adulterated
by Earths, [underline]& by the compounds of[/underline]
[underline]sulphur & iron[/underline], which I have
already mentioned under the name
of [underline]Pyrites[/underline]. -
The best coal is that which
burns with a bright light
