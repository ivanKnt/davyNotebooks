He conceives "[underline]that this[/underline] celebrated

The opinion of the change of Land

Strabo in his Geography
has described some of the opinions

[page]7|MS-DAVY-00604-000-00007|dnpgs64_005pp|100776454[/page]
of different philosophers with regard
to the shells & marine relics

continents & islands: |_ & [person]person_185|Pliny[/person]
has given an account of the
[underline]properties[/underline] of many of these
singular substances in his
[otherwork]otherwork_061|Natural History[/otherwork]; but as usual
He has blended his details with
a considerable portion of the
[underline]marvellous.[/underline] - He has described
fossil oister shells; which He tells
us are certain cures for
lameness & for Blindness
- He mentions the [insertion]shell called[/insertion] Cornu Ammonis
& the glossopetra [insertion][deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion][/insertion] but He considers
them rather as productions of the heavens
than of the Earth & states that
the [insertion]last substance[/insertion] falls from the clouds at the times
that the moon is in its wane: -

[page]8|MS-DAVY-00604-000-00008|dnpgs64_006pp|100776455[/page]
The opinions of Pliny are sufficiently
ridiculous with regard to the
organic remains found in stones
;but those of some of the
writers in y[superscript]e[/superscript] middle ages in
different parts of Europe
are (if [deletion]poss[/deletion] [underline]it be[/underline] possible)
[underline]still more absurd[/underline]. -
[person]person_061|Albert [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion] of Cologne[/person]
for instance in in a work
published in the 13 century
upon minerals mentions several
petrefactions of natural bodies
& particularly one of the branch
of a tree; but he supposes
the effect to have had no

to a certain [deletion]plastic[/deletion] [underline]forming[/underline]
[underline]power[/underline] in Nature which
operated beneath the surface
so as to [underline]produce imperfect[/underline]
[underline]resemblances, [deletion]of the[/deletion] of[/underline] living
[underline]beings[/underline], [deletion]ab[/deletion] which like their archetypes
were liable to [deletion]growth[/deletion] [insertion][underline]increase[/underline][/insertion] & to

- : The opinion that stones grow
like plants & animals &
assumed [underline]sometimes[/underline] similar forms
was [underline]prevalent even in[/underline] the four
[deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]following[/underline] centuries. -
thus D[superscript]r[/superscript] Plott in his History
of [underline]Oxfordshire[/underline] attributes all

Sir Thomas Browne [deletion]in[/deletion]

supposed that [underline]all stones[/underline]
[underline]come from seeds[/underline] in the

[person]person_1087|[underline]Lhuyd[/underline][/person] combatted the
idea of the [underline]plastic power[/underline]

has endeavored to establish
a [underline]distinct[/underline] class of strata

[underline]Rocks[/underline].
[deletion]Transition[/deletion] These [insertion]facts[/insertion] [deletion]Rocks[/deletion] however occur
so seldom & in general in
masses of so small a magnitude
as to render the distinction
[underline]almost unnecessary[/underline]; |_ And it
is more than probable that

but for further consideration, I am
inclined to beleive that this
subject will be best examined after
the general facts have been stated
in detail - It is very comprehensive
& important- To be well understood
it ought to be fully develloped
& it will most properly form the
[deletion]concluding part of[/deletion] the [insertion]object of the[/insertion] next
lecture. -
The secondary strata differ
in their arrangement & position
in different countries; but [deletion]in[/deletion]
[deletion]all cases[/deletion] there [underline]is an analogy[/underline]
in their composition & in their
[underline]properties[/underline] which demonstrates that
They are in all [underline]cases congenerous[/underline],
of one family & produced by

[underline]marble[/underline] is one of the most
common of the [underline]secondary Rocks[/underline]-
- [deletion]And[/deletion] Even when it is examined
in the smallest masses its
characters appear perfectly distinct
from those of primitive marble;
& though its composition is nearly
the same its texture is wholly
different.
It presents [deletion]a[/deletion] either a smooth
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] surface when broken
or a fracture exhibiting a number
of small plates & has no appearance
of being composed of distinct chrystals

Limestone
Secondary [deletion]marble[/deletion] [insertion]Limestone[/insertion] is of many
Kinds: & though its [deletion]main[/deletion] [insertion]principal[/insertion] constituent [insertion]parts[/insertion]

[page]27|MS-DAVY-00604-000-00027|dnpgs64_025pp|100776474[/page]

yet it often contains other earthly
matter - [underline]particularly magnesia[/underline], [deletion]& its[/deletion]
'-. The purest limestones are those
which most rapidly [underline]dissolve in[/underline]
acids & which leave the smallest
[insertion]quantity of[/insertion] [underline]insoluble matter[/underline] - The Limestone
that [underline]contains magnesia[/underline] is very difficultly
soluble
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The pure limestone is that
best fitted for the purpose
of manure & for improving lands.
but the [underline]magnesian limestone[/underline] in
its calcined state is poisonous to
vegetation though it make an
excellent cement which becomes solid
[deletion]under[/deletion] & [underline]hard under water[/underline] |_ The
brown and impure limestones that
contain much Iron & other foreign
matters are likewise generally

[page]28|MS-DAVY-00604-000-00028|dnpgs64_026pp|100776475[/page]
much more proper for calcination
& application to the purposes of
building, than the white [deletion]or[/deletion]
[underline]semitransparent marbles.[/underline]. -
[underline]Chalk[/underline] is a secondary substance
of the same compaction as
limestone [deletion]but[/deletion] it differs from
it [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] principally in [deletion][unclear]txxre[/unclear][/deletion]
form [underline]of its aggregation[/underline] - It consists
of a [underline]number [/underline]of particles losely
[underline]adhering to each other[/underline]; & not
[underline]united by chemical attraction.[/underline]

-. The [underline]Different Limestones[/underline] &
calcareous rocks often occur in
different strata in the
same district & they are
no less distinguished by
external characters than by
