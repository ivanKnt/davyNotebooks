Rocks deposited in regular layers
this generalisation has been
given up [insertion]by a number of philosophers[/insertion] & a more limited
theory adopted. -
[underline]Basalt[/underline] [deletion]as[/deletion] was shewn in the course of
the last lecture to be a chrystalized
substance, consisting of Hornblende
& Feld spar - Its elements are
not soluble in [insertion]common[/insertion] water [deletion]but they[/deletion]

being rendered fluid by Heat
though after [deletion]being [insertion]having been[/insertion] were[/deletion] fusion
they have never yet been
mad to assume their original

It is not possible therefore
to account for the origin
