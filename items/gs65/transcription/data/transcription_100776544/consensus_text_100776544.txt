This fact was adduced by D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Hutton as a demonstration of
the igneous origin of [underline]Basalt[/underline]: He
supposed that [deletion]this[/deletion] the materials
of it being projected in a
fluid state amongst the strata
of [underline]sandstone[/underline] had hardened them
at the [underline]point of contact[/underline] &
given them a new texture. -
- I have paid particular
attention to this appearance
I exhibited a specimen of
the junction of the Basalt
& sandstone in the last
lecture -
- This is a [deletion]specimen[/deletion] [insertion]piece[/insertion] of
the general [underline]layer of sandstone[/underline]
in its softest state.
