I have exposed a part of this
layer to Heat sufficient to
fuse [underline]basalt [/underline]; but I do not
find that it [deletion][unclear]xxxdeses[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]indurates[/insertion] in
any [underline]considerable degree.[/underline] -
-. And in examining the
hard mass in contact
with the [underline]basalt[/underline] & in
comparing it with the soft
mass below, [deletion]it[/deletion] I find
that their difference does
not depend upon a
different consolidation of
the same matter; but upon
a real difference [underline]of compaction.[/underline]
for the hard substance containes
much more silicious matter
