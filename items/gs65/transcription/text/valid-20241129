Whenever any circumstances occur
which mark distinct periods or
a succession of events in Nature
they uniformly supply means of
investigation & enable us to
reason concerning the relations
of [insertion]their[/insertion] causes. -
In considering the secondary
Strata filled with organic remains
& containing the vestiges of many
Beings analogous to living
generations, it is scarcely possible
to avoid speculation. - And
even the most sober & cool
Understanding is almost irresistibly

[page]4|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00004|dnpgs65_002pp|100776512[/page]
led to form ideas concerning
the state of things existing
at their [deletion]formation[/deletion] [insertion]origin[/insertion] & concerning
the powerful material agents
subservient to those great
Natural events, the occurence
of which is demonstrated by
their arrangement & wonderful
appearances. -
- The Subject is one of high
interest; but it ought to be
pursued with considerable caution.
Man possessing very brilliant
talents have differed essentially
upon it. Hypotheses have been
multiplied [overwritten]upon it[/overwritten] [overwrite]with[/overwrite] regard to it;
& much ingenuity & labour have

[page]5|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00005|dnpgs65_003pp|100776513[/page]
been employed upon the disscussion
In accounting for the present
order of things, We are enabled
constantly to appeal [underline]to the[/underline]
[underline]senses[/underline] , to combine [underline]observation[/underline]
& [underline]experiment[/underline]; [underline]but[/underline] in attempting
to explain the past changes
in [underline]Nature[/underline]; if we are in
possession of no distinct History,
Analogy is our only Guide,
Inferences must be made from
the Known concerning the
unKnown facts And the Mind
if unable to obtain certainty
must rest satisfied with
strong probability. -

[page]6|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00006|dnpgs65_004pp|100776514[/page]
|_ None of the facts concerning
the formation of the Secondary
Rocks can be immediately
Known - All our reasonings
upon them must be inductive.
They must be founded upon
the Knowledge of the properties
of the substances that compose
the strata & of the agents
by which these substances are
capable of being modified. -
And where [underline]causes[/underline] can be
plausibly develloped; it must
be from the examination
of existing operations that
produce appearances similar to those
which are the objects of [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]enquiry[/insertion] -

[page]7|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00007|dnpgs65_005pp|100776515[/page]
|_ Amongst the Secondary Rocks, [underline]Limestone[/underline]
is that which occupies the most
important place : |_ & it is the
[underline]stratified substance[/underline] perhaps the most
interesting in its relations to general
theory. -
- [underline]All shell limestones[/underline] when
minutely examined [underline]exhibit[/underline] a
texture which proves that
their constituent parts at the
time they were deposited upon
the organic remains were in
a state of [underline]liquidity or solution[/underline]. -
This inference it is not possible
to [underline]doubt[/underline] - The interstices of the
shells in marble are almost [insertion]always[/insertion] filled
[underline]with chrystals[/underline], chrystals likewise
abound in various parts of [deletion]the[/deletion]

[page]8|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00008|dnpgs65_006pp|100776516[/page]
most of these stones; [deletion]& as[/deletion] their
formation must have been subsequent
to that of the organic bodies
[underline]they include[/underline] [deletion]they[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] [deletion]must have[/deletion] [insertion]it implies[/insertion]
[deletion]been deposited upon them[/deletion]
[deletion]in a[/deletion] [insertion]previous[/insertion] state of [underline]chemical[/underline]
[underline]division[/underline]. -
- This is a principal fact
[deletion]which all[/deletion] admitted in all
the theories of Geology; but
explained in [deletion][unclear]any[/unclear][/deletion] different
manners. -
- |_ The only two Agents which
act upon a great scale in
Nature in [underline]producing fluidity[/underline]
or [underline]solution[/underline] are [underline]Fire & Water[/underline];
& these being the only powers
[deletion]known to us[/deletion] which could
have operated in the production

[page]9|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00009|dnpgs65_007pp|100776517[/page]
of the secondary strata [insertion]at least[/insertion] Known
to us are the only Powers
concerning [deletion]which[/deletion] the agencies of
which we have a right
to conjecture. -
-: It has long been known
that [deletion][unclear]xxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Limestone [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]Carbonate of Lime,[/insertion]
[underline]is soluble[/underline] to a small extent
in [underline]Water[/underline]. Almost all our common
pump & river waters contain
[deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] & it is more soluble
in water [deletion]containing[/deletion] [insertion]impregnated with[/insertion] carbonic Acid
or fixed Air [underline]than[/underline] in [deletion]common[/deletion] [insertion]pure[/insertion] [underline]water[/underline]
- . It has likewise been shewn
by some late [underline]experiments[/underline], that
this [underline]substance[/underline] is capable of
being fused by Heat.
[deletion]In our[/deletion] Under common circumstances

[page]10|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00010|dnpgs65_008pp|100776518[/page]
when limestone is ignited in our
fires the carbonic acid which forms
almost a half of its weight flies
off & the pure Lime is wholly
infusible :- |_ but when it Limestone
heated strongly in close vessels
from which the etastic fluid
cannot escape the compound
is readily softened & becomes
fluid at a white Heat. -
- This is a beautiful discovery
of Sir James Hall, I have had
the pleasure of examining his
specimens & of witnessing his method,
And I have seen pieces of
compact stone, [deletion]&[/deletion] even [deletion]chrystalized[/deletion]
[deletion]masses[/deletion] containing chrystals which
had been formed by [underline]Heat[/underline] under
[underline]pressure from [deletion]p[/deletion] coarsely[/underline] powdered
chalk. -

[page]11|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00011|dnpgs65_009pp|100776519[/page]
-. As both the [underline]great[/underline] Agents of Nature
are capable of rendering the constituent
parts of carbonate of Lime [underline]fluid[/underline].
We must guided by the appearances
in endeavoring to decide which
was most probably concerned in
the production of the secondary
[underline]limestone[/underline]. -
- |_The shells contained in Limestone
preserve their perfect forms & some
have their texture unaltered. -
Now it is difficult to conceive
that this could have happened
if they [deletion]ca[/deletion] had been surrounded
[deletion]by an ignited mass & fluid[/deletion]
[deletion]mass[/deletion] by melted matter for they
must themselves have been [deletion]for[/deletion]
brought into fusion: & consequently
ought to be found of the same

[page]12|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00012|dnpgs65_010pp|100776520[/page]
texture & compactness as the
stone in which they are [underline]imbedded[/underline]
or at least they ought to have
been in some measure altered
in their form or compaction -
= [deletion][unclear]Thxxxg[/unclear][/deletion] The greater number of
shell limestones are disposed
in alternate layers; & these
[deletion]effects[/deletion] have [deletion]much more[/deletion] every

that has been produced for the
[deletion]ign[/deletion] agency [deletion]for[/deletion] of fire is derived from
the fact of the curvature
of some of the calcareous strata
- This it has been said almost
proves that they were in
[underline]soft state[/underline] & that they were
elevated at the time of their
formation by some force acting
from beneath [deletion]them[/deletion] - 
[underline]Instance[/underline]
-. These are y[superscript]e[/superscript] sketches of the
[underline]arched strata[/underline] you saw
them in the former lecture.
|_ To me they seem unconnected
with any effect of Heat & they
may easily be accounted for
by [underline]supposing[/underline] an arched form
in [underline]the surface[/underline] upon which

[page]14|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00014|dnpgs65_012pp|100776522[/page]
the first layer was [underline]deposited[/underline]. -

[deletion]reasoner to conceive that this[/deletion]
[deletion]element generally so active was[/deletion]

[deletion]this production & consolidation[/deletion]
[short horizontal rule]
- The same general [deletion]reasoning[/deletion] [insertion]conclusions[/insertion]
may be applied [deletion]in[/deletion] with regard
to [underline]calcareous sand stone,[/underline] |_ which
consists of [underline]particles[/underline] [insertion]that[/insertion] [deletion]which[/deletion] had
[underline]not been in solution[/underline], cemented
by carbonate of Lime which
had been in solution so as often
to assume a chrystalized
form. -
|_ On the subject of Silicous
[underline]Sand stone[/underline] a new order

[page]16|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00016|dnpgs65_014pp|100776524[/page]
of facts must be brought forward
|_ The constituent parts of
this substance are impossible

as yet applied to in our
artificial processes; [deletion]& it is[/deletion] [insertion]but silicous[/insertion]

[page]17|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00017|dnpgs65_015pp|100776525[/page]

dissolved by the fluids of plants

in considerable quantities on

-That silicious sandstone
cannot owe its compactness
[deletion]& ch[/deletion] or its chrystalized texture
[underline]to [deletion]fire[/deletion] the agency of fire[/underline], even
[deletion]is in my opinion which[/deletion] [insertion][underline]allowing it capable of being[/underline][/insertion] [deletion]if[/deletion] to
[insertion][underline]fused[/underline],[/insertion] [deletion]operate at all [insertion]on it[/insertion] must have[/deletion]
[deletion]been much more intense than[/deletion]
[deletion]any we can produce,[/deletion] [underline]is I think[/underline]

[page]18|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00018|dnpgs65_016pp|100776526[/page]
evident from many appearances -
|_ Thus here we often found embedded
in [underline]Silicious Sandstones[/underline] fragments
of [insertion]very fusible[/insertion] [underline]rocks[/underline] not apparently altered
nor rounded in their forms
This I have seen in several
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] Instances; I particularly
recollect one in a quarry
[underline]near Edinburgh[/underline] in which
pieces of Win of very different
shapes occured in the Rock
& Win is fusible at a
heat which would scarcely
affect [underline]the sand stone.[/underline]
As silicious sandstone is found
both above & below [insertion]shell[/insertion] [underline]Limestone[/underline]
It is scarcely possible to

[page]19|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00019|dnpgs65_017pp|100776527[/page]
doubt [deletion]that[/deletion] but that some of
[deletion]some of[/deletion] the same causes must
have operated in the production
of both these classes of stones.
- And [insertion]consequently[/insertion] the only probable agent
to which we can [insertion]refer[/insertion] [deletion]reg[/deletion] the solution
[deletion]deposition[/deletion] of the silicious
matter, is water either
Heated or under some peculiar
circumstances of combination. -
[horizontal rule]
"- The different species of
[underline]Shistone Rocks[/underline] present no
chrystalized texture; & some
of them are capable of being
fused, [underline]& most of them[/underline] are
[underline]hardened[/underline] by [underline]fire[/underline]. - [deletion]There[/deletion]
[underline]Instance[/underline]
There is consequently very little

[page]20|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00020|dnpgs65_018pp|100776528[/page]
reason to supposed that this
agent was concerned in
[underline]their production[/underline]; |_ & their
origin may with a much higher
[deletion][unclear]mea[/unclear][/deletion] degree of [underline]probability[/underline] be
[underline]referred[/underline] to a deposition of
[underline]minute solid particles[/underline] of
argillaceous & silicious matter
which had been [deletion]for some[/deletion]
[deletion]time[/deletion] mechanically suspended
in water [deletion]& attracted by[/deletion]
[deletion]a[/deletion] & of which the present
adhesion is owing to
[underline]Bituminous [insertion]matter[/insertion] or oxide of iron.[/underline] -

[page]21|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00021|dnpgs65_019pp|100776529[/page]
must as there is every reason
to believe [insertion]like Shist[/insertion] have been produced
by the [deletion]aqueous[/deletion] deposition
of [underline]solid matter[/underline] finely divided
& suspended [underline]in a fluid[/underline]
|_ With regard to the strata [deletion]found[/deletion]
of flint [deletion]it[/deletion] which generally
alternate with chalk, it
is very difficult to assign
any satisfactory cause for
[underline]their formation[/underline] - that they
could not have been produced
by [underline]fusion[/underline] is however [deletion]I think[/deletion]
[underline]evident[/underline] [deletion]from these being found[/deletion]
[deletion]in great beds for in the[/deletion]
[deletion]first place In[/deletion] [insertion]|_ For if their constituent parts[/insertion]
[deletion]for if they are[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]they[/deletion] are at all[/insertion] capable of being

[page]22|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00022|dnpgs65_020pp|100776530[/page]
rendered liquid by Heat it can
only be by a degree [deletion]of it[/deletion] much
more intense than we are able
to produce; & such a heat
acting under [deletion]fire[/deletion] pressure; [deletion]fir[/deletion]
must necessarily have likewise
fused the [deletion]Lim[/deletion] calcareous
matter surrounding them -
- It very often happens
that [deletion]a[/deletion] perfect impressions of
the [underline]Echinus[/underline] are found filled
with flint whilst the exterior
is chrystalized carbonate of
Lime
[underline]Instance[/underline]
Now it is scarcely possible
to conceive that this could
have taken place; unless
the silicious matter had been

[page]23|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00023|dnpgs65_021pp|100776531[/page]
[underline]carried[/underline] through the orifices of the
shell & deposited in the cavity
by a [underline]fluid[/underline] & [underline]gradually[/underline] acting
[underline]menstruum.[/underline]
|_ - On the subject of the
[underline]origin[/underline] of [underline]coal[/underline] there have
been [deletion]many[/deletion] various opinions.-
|_ but the vegetable and animal
impressions that it contains
[insertion]which I mentioned in the last lecture[/insertion]
ought to lead us without
much minute discussion to
the theory of its production.-
Where wood has been
buried in the Earth in late
times; [deletion]it gradually[/deletion] |_ From
the action of water & of
Air, it always undergoes
a change which brings it
to a state similar to that of Pitcoal

[page]24|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00024|dnpgs65_022pp|100776532[/page]
[deletion]always to a state [insertion]not very dissimilar to that[/insertion] of [underline]Pitcoal[/underline][/deletion]
[underline]At Bovey in Devonshire[/underline] a
a whole forest is found [insertion]buried[/insertion] under
different strata of clay &
gravel; & the [deletion]wood[/deletion] trees
though [deletion]as[/deletion] [insertion]carbonaceous &[/insertion] black [deletion]as some[/deletion]
[deletion]pieces of [underline]pitcoal[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]have[/insertion] [deletion]retain[/deletion] [underline]their[/underline]
ligneous form & contain a substance
apparently intermediate between
[underline]bitumen &[/underline] resin as has
been shewn by M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hatchet.
- A similar species of coal
is found in Sussex & in
Iceland where it is named
Turtabrand; & the pieces appear

[insertion]from the [/insertion] pressure of the superincumbent mass.
during the time of the conversion
of the [underline]wood[/underline] into [underline]coaly[/underline] matter.
Vegetable and Animal substances
[deletion]matter[/deletion] may however [insertion]likewise[/insertion] be converted
into [deletion][underline]a substance[/underline][/deletion] [insertion]a body[/insertion] resembling
pitcoal by Heat under pressure.
|_ Sir James Hall has shewn this;
making use of the [insertion]same[/insertion] means as
[deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]those employed[/insertion] his experiments upon
[underline]Limestone[/underline] - [deletion]And[/deletion] |_ He has proved
that by a strong heat applied
to different animal
matters, & different species
of wood in closed vessels. -
[deletion]a matter[/deletion] [insertion][deletion]&[/deletion] a substance is[/insertion] produced [deletion]a[/deletion] black &
glossy & having properties different

[page]26|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00026|dnpgs65_024pp|100776534[/page]
from those of common charcoal as
it burns with a dense flame
giving out volatile matter.-
[short horizontal rule]
Sir James has adduced his experiments
[deletion]with great ingenuity[/deletion] as proofs
of the Huttonian Theory of
the [deletion]origin[/deletion] igneous origin of
pitcoal; his arguments are
in the highest degree ingenious
& if the insulated fact only
were to be considered very forcible
& convincing - |_ But when the [deletion][unclear]xx[/unclear][/deletion]
[insertion]usual[/insertion] [underline]strata[/underline] above and below coal
are examined it is scarcely possible
for the impartial observer to
suppose that they had been
subjected [underline]to heat[/underline] - [deletion] For[/deletion] they
are principally loose sandstone &

[page]27|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00027|dnpgs65_025pp|100776535[/page]
loose schist leaving [deletion]like[/deletion] every mark
of having been deposited [deletion]by[/deletion]
[deletion]seeping[/deletion] from a state of mechanical
[underline]suspension in water[/underline].-
[underline]Instance[/underline]
|_ The agency of water & the
Natural process of decomposition
to which all organized matter
is liable [insertion]then[/insertion] seems fully adequate
to explain the appearances of
the coal strata. -
Vegetable matter in its
first state of [deletion]carbonaceous[/deletion] fermentation
[underline]appears as heat[/underline] In another
& more advanced [underline]state[/underline] it is
the same substance as Bovey
coal - And when the bitumen
is completely formed it is

[page]28|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00028|dnpgs65_026pp|100776536[/page]
[underline]the true fossil coal[/underline], in which
the igneous texture is sometimes
evident and sometimes destroyed.-
[deletion]There are specimens of thin[/deletion]
[deletion]layers of coal found at different[/deletion]
[deletion][underline]depths near Glasgow[/underline] & they[/deletion]
[deletion]are in it[/deletion]
- In a quarry near Glasgow
vegetable matter is found in almost
all its different states of
conversion -
[deletion]This exists[/deletion] near the surface
it is but little decomposed. -
& here it occurs in very imperfect
sandstone apparently of late
formation.
in a [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]lower[/insertion] stratum about
ten feet below. It has the appearances

[page]29|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00029|dnpgs65_027pp|100776537[/page]
of wood slightly charred; & in
the compact & white [deletion]sto[/deletion] sand
stone which is used for building
it occurs apparently converted
into Bituminous coal. -
[underline]Instance[/underline]
The last subject of particular
theory which it will be necessary
to discuss is perhaps the most
[underline]difficult[/underline] and the most connected
with the operation of Unknown
[underline]powers[/underline] , I mean the formation
of the [underline]Basaltic Rocks[/underline];
- For a long while all
Basalt was considered as
a volcanic production; but
since it has been found
alternating with [deletion]the[/deletion] other

[page]30|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00030|dnpgs65_028pp|100776538[/page]
Rocks deposited in regular layers
this generalisation has been
given up [insertion]by a number of philosophers[/insertion] & a more limited
theory adopted. -
[underline]Basalt[/underline] [deletion]as[/deletion] was shewn in the course of
the last lecture to be a chrystalized
substance, consisting of Hornblende
& Feld spar - Its elements are
not soluble in [insertion]common[/insertion] water [deletion]but they[/deletion]
but they are capable of
being rendered fluid by Heat
though after [deletion]being [insertion]having been[/insertion] were[/deletion] fusion
they have never yet been
mad to assume their original
[underline]form.[/underline]
It is not possible therefore
to account for the origin
of the Rock satisfactorily

[page]31|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00031|dnpgs65_029pp|100776539[/page]
from any [deletion][unclear]xxxxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] certainly known
[underline]facts[/underline]; |_ & we must be
[underline]contented with[/underline] presumptive
[underline]evidences from[/underline] the particular
appearance from which [underline]it presents[/underline]
& the [insertion]circumstance[/insertion] [deletion]relation[/deletion] under which
[underline]it is found[/underline] -
All the Basaltic rocks of
great extent [deletion][unclear]xxxx[/unclear] known about[/deletion] as
yet examined have been [insertion]discovered[/insertion] [deletion]found[/deletion]
upon common secondary Rocks
containing organic Remains;
|_ & thin layers of Basalt extending
over many square miles often
occur between strata of
Shist [underline]& of sandstone[/underline] of the
[underline][deletion]of the[/deletion] common[/underline] kind, &
having nothing peculiar in their

[page]32|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00032|dnpgs65_030pp|100776540[/page]
aspect.
The same Basaltic strata which
occur in [underline]Teesdale[/underline] & which
are represented in this sketch
extend to the north into alstone
Moor; [deletion]&[/deletion] ; they have been
traced for more than thirty
miles & they are uniformly
found between the same
shistone strata; & the shist
below them & incumbent
upon them contains organic
[underline]remains[/underline] & is exceedingly
soft; though when acted upon
by a Heat much below
that necessary for forming the
Basalt it becomes very
[underline]hard[/underline]
[underline]Instance[/underline]

[page]33|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00033|dnpgs65_031pp|100776541[/page]
& at the white Heat it is
itself capable of being rendered
fluid.
[underline]Instance[/underline]
So that it is impossible
to suppose [underline]that this[/underline] Basaltic
structure was ever in igneous
fusion. -
- The same reasoning may be
applied [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]in accounting for the arrangement[/insertion] the other layers of
[underline]Basaltic Rocks[/underline] found in

Alternate with [underline]sandstone[/underline];

from the sketch & as
I mentioned in the last lecture
it is placed upon a [underline]Breccia[/underline]

Instance

[page]35|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00035|dnpgs65_033pp|100776543[/page]
- The Basaltic Rocks in the
[underline]neighbourhood of Edinburgh[/underline], are
[deletion]fixed[/deletion] almost all fixed upon sand
[underline]stone [insertion]shist[/insertion] or limestone[/underline]; but their
arrangement is much more disturbed
than in most other [underline]cases[/underline]. -
- [deletion]In the[/deletion] In the Basaltic
mountain called Arthurs seat
[underline]several layers[/underline] of irregularly
disposed columnar Basalt
are found alternating with
[underline]sandstone[/underline], |_ & at the point
of function the [underline]sandstone[/underline]
is of a different texture,
[deletion]&[/deletion] considerably harder & of
a red colour. -

[page]36|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00036|dnpgs65_034pp|100776544[/page]
This fact was adduced by D[superscript]r[/superscript]
Hutton as a demonstration of
the igneous origin of [underline]Basalt[/underline]: He
supposed that [deletion]this[/deletion] the materials
of it being projected in a
fluid state amongst the strata
of [underline]sandstone[/underline] had hardened them
at the [underline]point of contact[/underline] &
given them a new texture. -
- I have paid particular
attention to this appearance
I exhibited a specimen of
the junction of the Basalt
& sandstone in the last
lecture -
- This is a [deletion]specimen[/deletion] [insertion]piece[/insertion] of
the general [underline]layer of sandstone[/underline]
in its softest state.

[page]37|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00037|dnpgs65_035pp|100776545[/page]
I have exposed a part of this
layer to Heat sufficient to
fuse [underline]basalt [/underline]; but I do not
find that it [deletion][unclear]xxxdeses[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]indurates[/insertion] in
any [underline]considerable degree.[/underline] -
-. And in examining the
hard mass in contact
with the [underline]basalt[/underline] & in
comparing it with the soft
mass below, [deletion]it[/deletion] I find
that their difference does
not depend upon a
different consolidation of
the same matter; but upon
a real difference [underline]of compaction.[/underline]
for the hard substance containes
much more silicious matter

[page]38|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00038|dnpgs65_036pp|100776546[/page]
than the soft one
- Some of the pillars of the
Great of Basaltic Arrangments often
occur in a bent form
& curved; & this has been
brought forward as an argument
For their having been fluid [deletion]&[/deletion]
[deletion]it has been applied in the[/deletion]
[deletion]same manner to the appearances[/deletion]
[deletion]of [underline]those Rocks[/underline] &[/deletion] but the same
explanation may be given
of this phaenomena as
the other phaenomena of
the curvature of strata. -
The columnar form [deletion][underline]Instances[/underline][/deletion] generally speaking indeed
offers no evidences in favour of the igneous
-. [deletion]The agency of fire will[/deletion] [insertion]It is said that some of the lavas[/insertion]

[deletion]accurate solution of the columnar[/deletion]
rare instances |_ & [deletion]cannot be adduced[/deletion]
[deletion]forms of rocks; but there[/deletion]
[deletion]as evidence for the igneous system, for there[/deletion]
[deletion]are permeable distances during[/deletion]
And similar effects [deletion]often[/deletion] take place much more
[deletion]commonly the chrystalizing [unclear]xx xxxxxx[/unclear] masses[/deletion]
commonly during the drying of masses
which have been consolidated
by the agency of water. -
Thus the common form of
starch is produced at
the time of its drying; &
if pure [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] [insertion][deletion]clay[/deletion] Clay[/insertion]  be made
into a paste with water
& spread upon a large surface

the moisture [underline]into pieces many[/underline]
of [underline]which have[/underline] regular forms. -
All the facts seem to render

[page]40|MS-DAVY-00605-000-00040|dnpgs65_038pp|100776548[/page]
it probable that the Basaltic
Rocks usually found in alternation
with the common in secondary
Rocks cannot be of igneous
origin; |_ but the proposition
[underline]of the impossibility[/underline] of the
[underline]formation of[/underline] this substance
by [underline]fire[/underline], must not be
advanced ;- |_ In many
secondary & primitive countries
veins or dikes of Basalt
[underline]are found[/underline] which have
many [deletion]of[/deletion] characters similar
to those of lava &
which often appear to
have produced similar
effects

- At Cockfield in Durham
the coal strata are intersected
by a vein of [underline]Basalt[/underline];
& where this substance comes
in contact with the inflammable
[underline]matter[/underline] , its effects are precisely
[deletion]simple[/deletion] similar [deletion]in[/deletion] to those which
would be produced by fire -

opportunities of examining the
Kind of [underline]Basalt[/underline] which fills
