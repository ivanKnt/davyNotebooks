  "1": "is of the nature of the motions the nature of the motions or affections of radiant matter affections of radiant matter Two hypotheses have been explained invented to account for the principal operations of radiant matter. In the first it is supposed that the universe contains a highly rare & elastic substance which when put into a state of undulation produces these effects on our organs of sight which constitute the sensations of vision & the other phaenomena occasioned by solar & elastic terrestrial rays terrestrial rays light In the second it is conceived that particles are emitted or sent off from luminous or heat making bodies with great velocity & that they produce their effects by communicating their motions to bodies substances or by entering into them & changing their composition.- - The first of the suppositions was adopted by Higgins , Hooke & Euler ; the second by Newton & by the philosophers of the Newtonian school. Most Many of the phaenomena may be accounted for by either hypothesis but the Newtonian doctrine applies much more happily to most of the phaenomena",
  "2": "facts lately discovered respecting the modifications of light by double refraction & reflection. - Indeed it does not seem possible to account for the circumstance that ext extraordinary ext extraordinary a refracted ray which has suffered extraordinary refraction in passing through one or of or of chrystal should suffer ordinary refraction in passing through another like chrystal on the idea of the effect being a mere undulation of the ethereal medium; but it may be easily explained by supposing the rays to consist of particles endowed with rectilineal motion & possessed of a certain polarity that is an attraction for certain some surfaces of the chrystal & xxx a repulsion for others. - M Malus has given a very ingenious theory for the explication of these phaenomena by supposing that the molecules of producing light are possessed of three rectangular axes of which one is always in the direction of the ray of the other two are made by the influence of the repulsive forces exerted by the chrystaline medium perpendicular to the direction of these forces; & such a firm & such an effect would correspond",
  "3": "with the idea of the luminous particles being octaedrons.- As its the colored rays separated by the prism bear the same relation to double refraction that as with light as with light direct light bears it follows that their polarity must be of the same kind & this is what might be expected if the solar beam the solar beam direct light direct light be composed of be composed of be actually composed of different the rays producing different colours The case may be conceived to be analogous to those of xxxx & chrystaline bodies possessed of electrical polarity & regular chrystaline forms. - When a Tourmaline is broken into pieces the pieces are found to possess similar electrical powers to the original chrystal & a large rhomb of Calcareous Spar Calcareous Spar Calcareous Spar easily breaks into a number of similar rhombs. -"
