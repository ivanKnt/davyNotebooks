  "1": "Lecture 1. Introductory to Electro Chemical Science March 12. th 1808 -- It affords me the most sincere pleasure to be able to appear again before you. - There is no desire more alive & ardent in my mind than that of having it in my power to combine experiments made for the advancement of Science with the details of public lectures. --- -- The present course admits of such an union & I shall consider my exertions & labour in delivering it as more than compensated for by the satisfaction I shall receive if the end to which my wishes are so strongly directed be in any manner accomplished. -- I speak of labour & exertion not with the view of making a parade of difficulties & of the merit of overcoming them but merely to prepare for & to ask you to consider with indulgence what I am convinced will be a very imperfect work. --- -- The subject you will feel is in a great measure unexplored. - Little or no assistance in the investigation can be derived from Books",
  "2": "& I am obliged to trust almost wholly, to my own efforts & my own limited information Had I been able to make my preparations in full health & in full time, I should have possessed more confidence; & the novelty & importance of the subject would have been sources rather of hope than of fear; but the long confinement & severe illness which I have sustained have prevented me from maturely arranging my plans. Many ideas in full vividness before, I am unable at this moment to recover & investigations have been left incomplete which I had hoped to be able now to bring before you, & to connect with some brilliant results |_ You must regard this attempt, as an unfinished building of which the scaffolding has failed & demands repair; unfinished, but not neglected to be an object of future care & labour, unfinished not from a want of will in the Architect to pursue his object; but from a want of power.--",
  "3": "-- Electro-chemical Science relates to all the phenomena in which electrical agencies are concerned. -- It may be asked why has this new term been adopted? I trust not without good reasons - Electricity or Electrical Science has been always applied to a particular series of brilliant yet insulated effects in which chemical changes had no share -- The word Galvanism has likewise always been understood in a limited sense & it could not with propriety be made to include a general view of corpuscular philosophy & perhaps the name of Galvani has been already too often associated with the later philosophical truths. This observer was indeed the fortunate & accidental discoverer of a most important fact, but He mistook the interpretation & pursued it to no extent. And it is to the penetrating Genius of Volta that we owe the most happy elucidations & powerful instruments of the Science; but even the",
  "4": "name of Voltaism could not be used with strict philosophical justice for his discoveries comprehended electrical phenomena alone, & the most important results which have been since ascertained are chemical & connected with the general system of operations in Art & in Nature. - -- In so extensive a field of investigation a general view of the objects of discussion, of their order, connections & applications cannot be improper - It will be tedious but it is necessary |_& to all who may follow the course not merely from curiosity or the hope of being amused - but from the genuine love of knowledge I am convinced it will be useful. - Amidst the numerous subjects of exp ts . you will find many that have been before introduced to you; yet the most interesting will be of a novel character : - You will find that something has been accomplished which",
