  "4": "The ancients whose vivid imaginations whose sublime powers of generalization were never enlightened by experiment, contented themselves by considering fire as a certain etherial principle above common bodies;. xxxxxx loosely attached, or unwillingly confined to them having a constant tendency to quit the earth and ascend upwards; a visitor of this terrestrial system but a native of a higher system. - In the early chemical Philosophy of Beccher & of Stahl , the Heat & light develloped in combustion were regarded as dependent upon the disengagement of disengagement of peculiar inflammable principle fixed in all bodies capable of burning -",
  "5": "This imaginary active element was characterized under the name of Phlogiston . & for nearly a century its empire was almost universal in the laboratories |_ & nothing was heard of but combustible bodies & salts & processes of phlogistication & dephlogistication .-. About the time that this notion was first brought forwards two english Philosophers had indeed advanced a much more beautiful & correct opinion namely that combustion was owing to a union of a part of the air of the Atmosphere of the Atmosphere with the combustible matter & that the fire arose from the condensation of this air; xxxx matter xxxx matter but this happy illustration at that era met with no support",
  "6": "physics & chemistry as yet had no common bond of relation; & the revival of the hypothesis of Hooke & Mayow was reserved for modern times to be the chief glory of the school of Lavoisier . - Since the antiphlogistic Chemistry has become popular a modification of the pneumatic idea of combustion has been develloped. - |_It is said that the Heat arises from the aeriform matter absorbed & the light from the combustible body. - This the speculation of Macquer adopted by Leonhardi",
  "7": "& by Gren has been defended with much ingenuity in one of y e latest & best of our & best of our elementary treatises;- -... The reasoning upon the phaenomenon flowing from the electrochemical facts differs materially from all - The process is considered like all other chemical processes as a fact of electrical action; as the result of the equilibrium between the energies of two Bodies naturally in opposite electrical states. - Acids & alkalies which are respectively negative & positive produce heat by their union & are by supposed to produce it by their supposed to produce it by their electrical attraction & chemical adherence. - But Oxygene or pure air & inflammable bodies",

That it is conformable to many of the facts you have already witnessed;- You have seen that it harmonizes with the general hypothesis of chemical affinity - It will now be rigidly analysed in its relation",

It tastes like a solution of oil of vitriol oil of vitriol oil of vitriol in water & like that substance it will render turbid a solution of barytes . - The results of the combustion of Sulphur , then is Sulphuric acid Sulphuric acid Sulphuric acid , |_ but if this substance be formed by two materials, one naturally positive the other naturally negative, \"these materials by a certain high electrical power acting under proper circumstances, out ought to be capable of being separated that is there may be found a positive a positive surface artificially made positive artificially made positive capable",

Sulphur at negative.- So that in this instance the demonstration is very strict.- -. But if Sulphuric acid Sulphuric acid Sulphuric acid is composed of two substances one positive the other negatives it may be asked, why does it itself exhibit a negative energy; why",
  "12": "is it by a certain power of electricity itself attracted to the positive surface without decomposition? To answer this question a very satisfactory answer may I hope be given - These difficulties may be easily removed & the solution of them leads to the devellopment of some of the more refined laws of Electrochemical action. - If we put a glass a glass pieces of plate glass one considerably larger than the other be brought in contact & one be positively & the other negatively electrified they will adhere; though it is evident that the large glass will be electrified in a higher degree than the small one;",
  "13": "-& if by contact of a conductor of a conductor the two electricities be brought into equilibrium, there will be an excess an excess of that electricity existing on the largest surface largest surface . - . Now Sulphuric acid Sulphuric acid Sulphuric acid consists of a larger proportion of Oxygene than Sulphur - Qu instance Qu instance |_ & though to a certain extent the negative energy of the Oxygene is ballanced by that of the Sulphur , yet still the whole the whole in the whole resulting compound there will be an excess of negative energy. - & hence; when the acid is feebly acted on by a weak a weak a weak positive & negative electricity either in consequence of it being diffused through a bad conductor as water in a diluted solution in water in a diluted solution in water or in being exposed to exposed to in the action circuit of a small combination - The artificial positive electricity will be",

  "15": "7 such a case the elements obtained will be primary & not secondary. - In a similar manner we may reason upon the phaenomena presented by the combustion of Phosphorus . - phosphorus is supposed to be positive with regard to Oxygene ;- - They attract each other when the when the with great power for y e particles of the with great power for y e particles of the phosphorus possess xxx free xxx free such freedom of motion as to be capable of evaporating in the air - Hence combustion & the formation of acid matter. - Instance 10 - 15 40 New process exalt the energy of the phosphorus by heat phosphorus by heat & the process is amazingly rapid.",

Phosphoric acid Phosphoric acid Phosphoric acid contains more Oxygene than phosphorus , the negative energy is predominant in it -- & when this excess this excess of energy only, is ballanced an attraction of the whole acid to the positive surface takes place & there is no decomposition - ... It will be unnecessary to multiply instances to a greater extent. - The same phaenomena laws will apply; generally to all process of combustion or of the of the combination of two bodies of two bodies in which acid matter is formed & to the formation generation & decomposition formation generation & decomposition of Nitric & carbonic Acids. - Nitric Acid Nitric Acid Nitric Acid is produced by the",

In the first instance the excess of energy only is ballanced in the second the whole original natural energies are brought into equilibrium. - Besides the acids formed by combustion & which are acids with simple & Bases; these others generated",

  "21": "with respect to Oxygene may yet have different energies with respect to each other as is the case with other combustible Bodies - & hence not being repellent of each other a triple union may under certain circumstances take place. - The compound acids by high powers are decomposed like the simple ones simple ones : - The two combustible bases combustible bases , the Positive bases with respect to Oxygene separating at the negative surfaces. - [short horizontal rule] Instance By experiments of this kind the ir composition of all the vegetable acids of all the vegetable acids might be easily ascertained. - In such as have been accurately examined the quantity of Oxygene predominates",
  "22": "over the quantity of inflammable matter. - So that it might be laid down as a principle as far as our knowledge extends\" that in compound acid matter there is always in excess of negative energy, & a proportion of Oxygene more than sufficient to ballance, by its natural electricity, the Electricity of the inflammable base. - |_ According to these ideas the word Oxygene is less objectionable than it would seem to be at the first view of the new facts. - For it may signify either generating acids or produced from acids - Oxus being acid",

To alter",

  "25": "23 & the analysis of their compounds -: You saw the combustion of Iron in Oxygene gas - The Iron is highly positive, Oxygene is negative \" there is a rapid combination a powerful attraction connected with brilliant heat & light - Now if we examine - Now if we examine this process minutely this process minutely this process minutely I do not repeat this experiment for the sake of producing a brilliant result but to point out a most important circumstance intimately connected with the whole Elec l . theory. - of 40 . 30 Oxygene gas only 25 parts for 100 . - Now as the Iron is highly positive",
  "26": "we can scarcely exp suppose that the energy the energy of 1/4 of Oxygene should be sufficient to neutralize the energy of three fourths of Iron. - We might naturally expect then the oxide would display an excess of the energy of the energy of the Iron - Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron is positive with regard to acids & when a salt containing an acid & Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron is acted on by a feeble power not sufficient to separate the Iron in a metallic state, oxide of Iron collects round the negative surface. - Instance And this fact beautifully",
  "27": "explains the affinity of an oxide for an acid. - which is always however weak however weak . .The acid possesses an excess of negative energy, the oxide of Positive . - these energies come in equilibrium & a new compound is the result. - -: The combustion of the Metals in general is attended with a very considerable emission of light & heat: but in the atmosphere it does not continue in the same manner as the combustion of the common inflammable bodies because neither the metals themselves nor the products of their combustion are in any high degree volatile. - & the oxide forming a coating upon the surface defends the interior from the action of air - It is for this",
  "28": "reason that a thick piece of iron will not continue to burn even in Oxygene gas but from a thin piece the oxide is thrown off. - The power of continuing inflammation is nearly proportional to the volatility of the metals - Thus Zinc & Arsenic after being once inflamed will continue to burn. - Instance - There is another reason why when oxides not volatile appear in combustion they tend to stop the process.- they are nonconductors of electricity - whereas intensely heated elastic fluids are conductors - Hence if combustion depends upon the equilibrium between the two energies, this equilibrium could not take place through the medium of a nonconductor",
  "29": "though it would take place through the medium of a conducting body -. The products of Metallic combustion in all cases accurately examined contain an excess of the metallic base; & all that I have carefully tried exhibit the positive energy with regard to acids -. There is a very elegant simple method furnished by the Voltaic apparatus of demonstrating the small proportion of Oxygene absorbed in metallic combustion. - & Instance. elegant mode of general proportion - Hence it is that like the Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron they are all capable of combining with acids; but both the negative",
  "30": "energy of acids & the positive energy of metallic oxides; being only the excess above the ballance of the energies of their bases are exceedinly small feeble & hence these combinations are slow & connected with little sensible heat as might be expected from the annihilation of very feeble weak electricities - The Metallic oxides all possessing more or less the positive energy xxxxx repelled xxxxx repelled xxxxx repelled when acted on by feeble electrical powers. are repelled by the positive surface & attracted by the negative surface. - Thus as in the case of Iron so likewise as in the case of Iron so likewise in an exceedingly weak solution of iron Zinc acted",

  "32": "-. When any oxide is merely moistened with water with water - by a power such as that of this battery it is rapidly decomposed & the metal rapidly collects round the negative surface. Instance Tin . Bismuth s Lead ammoniant of Copper ammoniant of Copper ammoniant of Copper revivication of the copper - Even oxides that are scarcely reducible by the combined the combined exposure to exposure to exertion of exertion of the highest heat of forges or furnaces forges or furnaces assisted by the power of inflammable Bodies, readily yeild their metals under this species of agency. Tungsten - for instance for instance",
  "33": "..- The most a few globules scarcely perceptible here its metallic nature very distinct - The oxides of Titanium & Manganese might be might be which are highly refractory bodies might I have decomposed I have decomposed be decomposed in the same manner. - the oxide of oxide of Columbium discovered by M r Hatchett M r Hatchett M r Hatchett & which has never been exhibited in a metallic form will probably yeild to this species of agency this species of agency a similar agency a similar agency . - So that in these particular facts there is another field of Electrochemical science opened for investigation, new methods for exalting our powers of analysis & for bringing new natural bodies under the dominion of Chemistry. -",
  "34": "- The last subjects that I shall consider in this lecture are some of those phaenomena of chemical change chemical change in which one metal is detached from its solution, by another in consequence of what is called its superior affinity superior affinity & which is immediately related to the general electrochemical Theory of metallic oxidation. Here Sol: copper Zinc - said to be by the superior aff y of Zinc Now how is this explained according to the electrical Hypothesis? Zinc is positive with regard to copper & therefore must be",
  "35": "more positive with respect to Oxygene & acids - Hence its natural electricity will more perfectly annihi bring into equilibrium the Electricity of the constituents of the acid; & the Zinc will enter must enter into combination & the copper must be deposited? - And the demonstration of this theory is that of the Zinc copper be made artificially more negative positive that the Zinc positive that the Zinc in the xx the xx in a high degree.

But whatever opinion may be formed upon this head, I trust the results of the experiments will not be confounded with the hypothetical theoretical explanations that have been applied to them. - The hypothesis may be considered merely as the cement in a building, useful in connecting the materials together & in giving them a seemly order. & if the materials are valuable they may will exist be employed permanent even when though the cement is decayed is decayed should decay; or though their first arrangement should have been made by an unskillful hand",
