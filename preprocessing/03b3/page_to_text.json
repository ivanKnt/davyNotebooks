It was shewn that different bodies become electrical by mere contact; - & friction & friction . - And that in And that in the, same body Electricity is the, same body same body Electricity is produced by changes of temperature produced by changes of temperature or changes of form or changes of form : & it was stated that in all cases in which one part of a body or a system of bodies is positive in as the part is one as the part is one as the part is one the state called positive. Another body -. . is negative.- -. It was likewise shewn that",
  "4": "an electrified body is capable of producing electricity in another body without contact -, - And this was called Electricity by induction - \" And it was shewn . that in the case of induced electricity. - That surface of the body not originally electrical not originally electrical which is opposite to that surface of the electrified Body which is positive becomes negative - & vice versa - And it was shewn that the accumulation of Electricity in different instruments; & its discharge are dependent upon the circumstances & laws of this inductive influence inductive influence or power or power . - In this lecture I shall In this lecture I shall",

  "7": "46 by conceiving a number of cylinders opposed to each other in the atmosphere in the atmosphere & which have which have each furnished with each furnished with an apparatus for rendering each rendering each primary primarily active primarily active excitation ; - It is evident that the powers of the whole may must be increased by the principle of induction . - Ritters battery Ritters battery Ritters battery Ritters battery Instance . - This would extend to any so shewn o by the luminous royal Institution. . luminous royal Institution. . - But it may be asked if such is the law of the accumulation of Electricity in the Voltaic combination; why does not an arrangement act in the air , why is water or a fluid body essential to the effect.-",
  "8": "To be able to understand this we must examine the general circumstances of the accumulation of the accumulation of Electricity in relation to what is in relation to what is called by Electricians called by Electricians quantity & Intensity .-. - You have observed that, in the phaenomena presented by the common electrical machine - the spark passes to different distances in different cases; - And the case is the same in the discharge of Jars .-; - The space through which a spark passes is said to denote the intensity of the Electricity; & this intensity is",
  "9": "46a said to be greater or less, in proportion as the spark passes through a larger or a smaller space of air. - Instance . - Lanes quadrant Electrometer Lanes quadrant Electrometer Lanes quadrant Electrometer Lanes quadrant Lanes quadrant Electrometer - Now if a jar be charged; & brought into contact with & brought into contact with so as to give a spark of 9. half an inch or so as to or so as to repel an electrometer to 25 repel an electrometer to 25 degrees ; & then be connected both by its positive & negative surfaces with another equal jar jar; .- It is evident that the quantity of electrical power must remain the same ; though it is distributed over more space over more space . but the spark from the two jars the two jars will 46a",
  "10": "only pass through a quarter of an inch an inch - In this case the intensity of the Electricity can be said to be only half as great. - If a Battery of twenty jars were to be used to be used ; the spark would pass through scarcely a perceptible space of air : Instance - And when if a hundred jars be employed actual contact would be required, so that no spark would be visible but the shock would still be sensible be sensible - It would however be very different from the shock given by the single jar single jar ; The single jar",
  "11": "47 would give a painful & violent impression felt principally in the elbows & wrists. - The Battery containing the same quantity of electricity will give - a most grating sensation in jaw & a feeling of heat principally about the chest & shoulders. - The same quantity of Electricity .. whatever be the surface on which it acts appears as far as our exp ts have yet gone to be discharged immediately by perfect conductors perfect conductors ; - ie whether a jar; is discharged alone or connected with a battery. - There is no perceptible time when a metallic wire is",
  "12": "used; but if imperfect conductors be employed conductors be employed ; more time is required to discharge the electricities of low than of high intensity high intensity ; for .

  "13": "48 Electricity of a high intensity - But if water imperfect conductors be insulating bodies insulating bodies to any Electricity , they will act as a medium of induction ; & an accumulation & discharge will take place through, them & fluids in consequence will be conducting in relation in relation to the low intensity low intensity of the Metals in the Voltaic apparatus what gasses or airs gasses or airs are to the higher electricity of the common Machine common Machine & the leyden jar. - { that Electricity in a low state { of Intensity will act by induction in - That the Electricity of the - That the Electricity of the - That the Electricity of the fluids is shewn by many experiments on a wire in water.

  "14": "but in immense quantities; In thee charge of the common jar common jar ; it is small quantity but of high intensity . -- In the one case it is a large quantity diffused over an immense surface. In the other case - It is a small quantity diffused over a very small surface small surface . - If these consideratons be kept in view; the Theory of the Voltaic pile / which all elucidations that can be given is still a difficult subject; the Theory",
  "15": "49 of the Voltaic combination will be found to harmonize with the other facts of Electricity . Instance - The quan - The quan - And the Intensity of the Electricity increases with the number of the series of the series ; so that 500 series will give a spark capable of passing through air through air ; - It will however differ from the common electrical spark in this that as a much greater quantity of positive & negative power come into equilibrium so its effects will be infinitely stronger; & its power of ignition",

  "29": "56 I spoke in the last lecture of various phaenomena of Atmospheric Electricity ; in which the Electricity may be regarded as in that state of Intensity state of Intensity which is analagous to the at state exhibited by the common Electrical machine; I shall now speak of some Electrical effects produced by arrangements in which the state is similar to that of the Electricity belonging to the Voltaic Battery. & these arrangements belong are attached are attached to animated Beings. - It was known to the ancients that a fish of the Ray Kind Ray Kind , The Torpedo which was called by the Greeks, Narke had the power of giving shocks",
