In the preceding Lectures, the solid parts of the surface of the Globe have been considered in what may be regarded as their states of permanency; in their great & general arrangements. - It has been seen that the foundations of our Earth are constituted by immense irregular masses of consolidated materials of different kinds, affording the variety of Mountain, valley, Hill & Plain: forming the basins of the Ocean, & of lakes & the beds of rivers, & intersected by veins containing the metallic ores & other substances which have been made subservient to the purposes & comforts of Man. - The natural order of investigation, leads to the examination of the Laws of the alterations of the surface of the Globe; to an enquiry concerning \"the powers by which the Mechanism of Nature is preserved.\" - Change is the characteristic of all terrestrial things; & the most refined Philosophy of the subject, consists, in tracing the order of events, by which Change is made subservient to the harmony of our system, & to the purposes of Life. -",
  "2": "In taking a view of the alterations of the Globe, connected with Geology, it is necessary to examine all the circumstances that can operate, & all the agents concerned, whether Chemical or Mechanical. - Our Globe, by a beautiful, & wonderfully intelligent arrangement, is made to revolve round its own axis, & round the Sun, in such a manner, that its different parts are unequally supplied with light & heat: that changes of temperature are continually taking place, & all the variety of Seasons is produced. - The difference of the influence of the Sun, is a prime mover, in all terrestrial alterations, & this influence acts immediately, & likewise by increasing the energy of the effects of water & air upon the solid parts of the Earth. - All water is ultimately derived from the Ocean, which occupies nearly 2/3 of the surface of the Globe, & which according to the calculations of La Place La Place La Place cannot possess a mean depth of less than four Miles. - Acted on by the attractions of the Sun & Moon, this great body of fluid is agitated by Tides - It is kept",
  "3": "in motion likewise by Winds - & moisture raised by heat in an invisible form from its surface, is condensed in the colder regions of the Atmosphere, & poured down in rain, mist or dew, becoming the origin of rivers, & affording the supply of lakes, & returning in constant circulation to its parent source. - The Atmosphere in which we breathe & move, & which every where invelopes the surface, is an immense body of elastic matter, extending to at least 40 miles above the Earth. It is extremely moveable in its parts, & susceptible of the impression of heat. - The currents arising from its motions, constitue Winds. One of its elements is the most active substance in nature; & it is equally subservient to the purposes of vitality, in its direct operation upon living Beings, & in its more remote effects on the surface which they inhabit. - The Atmosphere is the great Theatre of Electrical Changes; the grandeur & magnificence of which are displayed in the thunder Storm; & which are efficient in a more tranquil series of operations, belonging to the daily & constant Order of Events. - All the phenomena of Geological changes, & amongst them, even, Earthquakes",
  "4": "& subterraneous fires, seem to be connected with the agency of Heat, Electricity, Air, & water, in the solid materials of the Globe. - Gravitation & Cohesion, tend to preserve the permanency of the System; Heat, Electricity, & Chemical attraction, are constantly disposing its elements, to new arrangements: But the opposing powers are balanced, their equilibrium is preserved, & though the parts continually change, the whole appears immutable. - It will be necessary to illustrate these general ideas, by particular instances, & to shew in what manner so many different causes co-operate in producing a joint effect - Rocks in their interior preserve a temperature which is about the mean temperature of the Atmosphere, but superficially there is a continual variation. - Their parts in general are non-elastic, but are expanded by heat, & contracted by Cold. - And such agencies operating, in the long course of Ages, there is every reason to believe, must at last alter the texture of the surface, & diminish the aggregation of its parts. -",

Instance & this moisture existed in its pores & was derived from the atmosphere - The case would be similar",
  "6": "with any other Rock, but the quantity would differ in different specimens. Soft Sandstone would produce more than Limestone . - Shist more than Serpentine ; & the secondary soft Granite , more than the primary hard Granite , which, least of all exhibits this property. - The water found in Cavities of the interior of many stones, particularly of Basalt , seems to be owing to their permeability to the moisture of the Atmosphere. - I have seen a loose columnar basalt columnar basalt columnar basalt near Portrush, in the North of Ireland North of Ireland North of Ireland , which when broken, affords considerable portions of water, which has all the characters of rain water, & that its texture is permeable to vapour, I proved by a very simple experiment. - A small column was broken into two parts - one immediately examined afforded cavities, almost all of which were filled with water, the other was kept under a fireplace, for two or three days, where the temperature must have been often about that of the boiling point of water. - there was no explosion, or mechanical disintegration of the stone, but when it was broken, no water broken, no water was found, it all had evaporated escaped had evaporated escaped through the pores, in consequence of the evaporating agency of Heat. -",
  "7": "- |_ In the great series of Natural operations, the moisture the moisture included in stones, or adhering to their surfaces in a fluid form, has its volume altered by every change of temperature, in a much greater degree, than the Stoney matter. - The sudden impression of heat from the Sun beams, causes it to expand, & this expansion must be usually connected with a slight alteration in the texture of the Rock. - When the water is converted into ice, there is a still greater enlargement of its volume, the surface in this case when fully permeated with fluid, is often separated into parts, & the whole arrangement destroyed. - The destructive operation of ice is particularly distinct upon those rocks, which present in their Character as masses, small & numerous apertures - in which the sides are so approximated as to admit of the adhesion of water. - Grauwacke Shist . Grauwacke Shist . Shist In Granite for instance, the blocks are usually too large, & the orifices too wide to admit of the agency, but in porphyry , in Shist , in Serpentine , & in Marble, there is in the transverse fractures a space, & such rocks are often considerably changed, & degraded, even in a single winter by the operation of ice.

The shelving nature of the upper part of the Shistose & Serpentine Cliffs, & the immense fragments forming their bases, announce in a distinct language, the gradual decay of their surfaces & the cause that has been stated, is certainly a prime cause. - For the same reasons that Shist , & Serpentine are more decomposable by the expansive agency of water than Granite , the secondary Rocks generally speaking are more destructible than the primary - From their looser texture, from their stratified forms; & the nature of their fracture they easily yield to this species of agency Instance Mamtor , or the Shivery Mountain in Derbyshire . - |_ The extensive dissolving powers of water are much more generally known, than its expansive energies",

So that the surfaces of Rocks in a moist state may undergo change, from the tendency of Electricity to evolve some of their principles & a gradual decay & degradation would result from such an operation. - |_ It is difficult to discriminate accurately between the effects of all these diversified agencies; & it is only by the minute study of the aspect of Rocks, that fair conclusions can be drawn. - In the same class of Rocks same class of Rocks , a slight variety in species, a minute difference in chemical composition or in texture will exceedingly affect the tendency to be operated on, by the different powers",
