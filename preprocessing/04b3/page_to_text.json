  "16": "But these phenomena may be easily account- -ed for on an Hypothesis which flows from the ideas which have been just developed - (The meteoric stones all of them consist principally of the earths in a loose state of aggregation, and if we suppose that they come into our atmosphere in a metallic state form - Their combustion would be a necessary effect of their combination with Oxygene ; and their combustion their combustion it would become more vivid; in their descent, in proportion as they passed as they passed thro' a denser air thro' a denser air .
