  "73": "55 Art. Notice of some experiments & new views respecting flames respecting flames By Sir H. Davy.- H. Davy.- When a wire gauze safe lamp is made to burn in a very explosive mixture of coal gas & air, the light is feeble & of a pale blue colour; whereas the flame of a current of coal gas burnt in the atmosphere; as is well known by the phenomena of the gas lights, is extremely brilliant. In a paper read before the Royal Society Royal Society Royal Society , I have endeavoured to shew, that in all cases flame is a continued combustion of explosive mixtures; it became, therefore, a problem of some interest; \"Why the combustion of explosive mixtures of the same substances under different circumstances, should produce such different appearances.\" A very acute philosopher, who himself started the subject in conversation, suggested the idea, that in the combustion of explosive mixtures within the lamp Carbonic oxide Carbonic oxide Carbonic oxide might be formed; & that the light might be deficient, from the deficiency of the quantity of Oxygene necessary to produce Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid .- On submitting this idea to the test of experiment, it was discovered to be unfounded; for by the combustion in the wire-gauze lamp, Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid was produced in quantities as great as could have been expected from the quantity of Oxygene consumed; & on adding Oxygene to xx a mixture in quantities more than sufficient to burn the whole of the gas, the character of the light still continued the same. In reflecting on he circumstances of the two species of combustion, I was led to imagine that the cause of the superiority of the light of the stream of coal gas might be owing to the decomposition of a part of the gas towards the interior of the flame where the Oxygene was in smallest quantity, & the deposition of solid charcoal",
  "74": "56 which, first by xxxxxxx ignition xxxxxxx ignition its ignition & afterwards by its combustion , increased in a high degree the intensity of the light; & a few experiments soon convinced me that this was the true solution of the problem.- I held a piece of wire-gauze of about 900 apertures to the square inch over a stream of coal gas issuing from a small pipe, & inflamed the gas above the wire gauze; which was almost in contact with the orifice of the pipe; when it burned with its usual bright light; - On raising the wire-gauze so as to cause the gas to be mixed with more air before it inflamed, the light became feebler; & at a certain distance the flame assumed the precise character of that of an explosive mixture burning within the lamp; but though the light was so feeble in this last case, the heat was greater than when the light was much more vivid, & a piece of wire of Platinum held in this feeble blue flame became instantly white hot.- On reversing the exp t by inflaming a stream of Coal gas, & passing a piece of wire gauze gradually from the summit of the flame to the orifice of the pipe, the result was still more instructive; for it was found that the apex of the flame intercepted by the wire gauze afforded no solid charcoal , but in passing it downwards, solid charcoal was given off in considerable quantities, & prevented from",
  "75": "57 burning by the cooling agency of the wire-gauze; & at the bottom of the flame where the gas burnt blue in its immediate contact with the atmosphere, charcoal ceased to be deposited in visible quantities.- - This principle of the increase of the brilliancy & density of flame by the production & ignition of solid matter, appears to admit of many applications. I have commenced the experimental investigation of some of them; but as my enquiries are still unfinished, I shall hint only at xxxxxxxx the most obvious of the views connected with them. On a future occasion I hope to be able to pursue at full length this interesting subject.- 1 st The principle explains readily explain the appearances of the different parts of the flames of burning bodies, & of flame urged by the blow pipe: the point of the inner blue flame, where the heat is greatest, is the point where the whole of the charcoal is burnt in its gaseous combinations without previous deposition.- 2. It explains the intensity of the light of those flames in which fixed solid matter is produced in combustion, such as that of the flame of phosphorus & of Zinc in Oxygene , &c. & of Potassium in chlorine ; & the feebleness of the light of those flames in which gaseous or volatile matter alone is produced, such as those of Hydrogene & Sulphur in Oxygene , phosphorus in chlorine &c. 3 it offers means of increasing the light of certain",
  "76": "58 burning substances, by placing in their flames even incombustible substances. Thus the intensity of the light of burning Sulphur , Hydrogene , carbonic oxide &c. is wonderfully increased by throwing into them oxide of Zinc , or by placing in them very fine amianthus or metallic gauze.- 4: It leads to deductions respecting the chemical nature of bodies & various phenomena of their decomposition. Thus Ether burns with a flame which seems to indicate the presence of Olefiant gas Olefiant gas Olefiant gas in that substance. Alcohol burns with a flame similar to that of a mixture of Carbonic oxide Carbonic oxide Carbonic oxide & Hydrogene ; so that the first is probably a binary compound of Olefiant gas Olefiant gas Olefiant gas & water & the second of Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid & Hydrogene .- When Cuprine Cuprane or protochlorid of copper is introduced into the flame of a candle or lamp, it affords a peculiar dense & brilliant red light, tinged with green & blue towards the edges, which seems to depend upon the chlorine being separated from the copper by the Hydrogene , & the ignition or combustion of the solid copper & charcoal . Similar explanations may be given to the phenomena presented by the action of other combinations of chlorine on flame; & it is probable that in many of those cases when the colour of flame is changed by the introduction of incombustible compounds that the effect depends upon the production & subsequent ignition or combustion of inflammable matter from them. Thus the rose coloured light given to flame by the compounds of Strontium and Calcium , & the yellow colour given by those of Barium , & the green by those of Borion may depend upon a temporary production of these bases by the inflammable action of the flame.",
  "77": "2 7 1/2 1 3 /4 59 Whenever a flame is remarkably brilliant & dense, it may be always concluded that some solid matter is produced in it: on the contrary, when a flame is extremely feeble & transparent, it may be inferred that no solid matter is formed. Thus none of the volatile combinations of Sulphur burn with a flame in the slightest degree opaque; & consequently, there is no reason from the phaenomena of its flame to suspect the existence of any fixed basis in Sulphur . 5. These views will probably offer illustrations of electrical light. The Voltaic arc of flame from the great battery, differs in colour & intensity according to the substances employed in the circuit; & is infinitely more brilliant & dense with charcoal than with any other substances.- May not this depend upon particles of the substances separated by the electrical attractions ? & the particles of charcoal being the lightest amongst solid bodies ( as their elementary proportional number shews ) & the least coherent, would be separated in the largest quantities.- 6. The heat of flames may be actually diminished by increasing their light (at least the heat communicable to other matter) & vice versa.- The flame which produces the most intense heat amongst those I have examined, is that of a mixture of Oxygene & Hydrogene in slight excess compressed in Newmans blowpipe Newmans blowpipe Newmans blowpipe apparatus, & inflamed from a small aperture. This flame is hardly visible in sunshine, yet it instantly fuses very refractory bodies; & the light from solid matters ignited in it, is so vivid as to be painful to the eye,- London July 2 5 .- London July 2 5 .-",
