Davy LLD FRS I have pursued my enquiries respecting the limits of the size of the apertures & of the wire in the metallic gauze which I have applied to secure the coal miner from the explosions of fire damp. - Gauze made of Brass wire 1/50 of an inch in thickness & containing only ten apertures to the inch or 100 apertures in the square inch employed in the usual way as a guard of flame did not communicate explosion in a mixture of 1 p t 2 128 of coal gas & 12 p ts of air as long as it was cool but as soon as the top became hot an explosion took place. A quick lateral motion likewise enabled it communicate explosion - Gauze made of the same wire containing 14 apertures to the inch or 196 to the square inch did not communicate explosion till it became strongly red hot when it was no longer safe. in explosive mixtures of coal gas but no motion that could be given communicated to it by shaking it in a close jar method produced explosion. - Iron wire gauze of 1/40 & containing 3 129 240 apertures in the square inch appeared was safe in explosive mixtures of coal gas till it became strongly red hot when at the top. Iron wire gauze of 1/50 & of 24 apertures to the inch or of 656 to the square inch appeared safe under all circumstances in explosive atmospheres of coal gas: - I kept up a continual flame in a cylinder of this kind 8 eight inches high & two inches in diameter for a quarter of any hour varying the proportions of coal gas & air as much far as was compatible possible with their inflammation the top of the cylinder continued for some minutes was strongly red hot; but though the mixed gas 4 130 was passed rapidly through the cylinder it so as to by pressure from a large gazometer & a pair of double bellows so as to make it a species of wind furnace blast furnace yet no explosion took place. - I mentioned in my last communication to the Society that a flame confined in a cylinder of very fine wire gauze did not communicate explode a mixture of Oxygene & Hydrogene which but that the gasses burnt in it with great vivacity. - I have repeated this exp t in nearly a pint of the most explosive mixture of the two gasses; they xxxx burnt violently within the cylinder; but though the upper part 5 131 became nearly white hot yet no explosion was communicated but & so great was the heat that it was necessary to withdraw the cylinder to prevent the bass wires from being melted. - These xxxxxxx results are best explained by considering the nature of the flame of combustible bodies; Which in all cases must be considered as the combustion of an explosive mixture of inflammable gas or vapour with & air: for it can not be considered regarded as a mere combustion at the surface of contact of the inflammable matter & the circumstance fact is proved by holding a taper or a piece of burning phosphorus within the a large flame of spirits made by the combustion 6 132 of alkohol, the flame of the candle or of the phosphorus or of the c will appear in the centre of the other flame proving that there is oxygen even in its interior part: of - The heat communicated by flame must depend upon its xxxx mass this is shewn by the fact that in a the top of a slender cylinder of wire gauze hardly ever becomes dull red in the exp t on an explosive mixture whilst in a larger cylinder made of the same material the central part of the top soon becomes bright red. - A large quantity of cold air thrown upon a small flame lowers its heat 7 133 beyond the explosive point: & in extinguishing a flame by blowing upon it the effect is probably principally produced by this cause assisted probably by a dilution of the explosive mixture. - If a piece of wire gauze sieve is held over a flame of a lamp or of coal gas, it prevents the flame from passing it & the phenomenon is precisely similar to that exhibited by the wire gauze cylinders; the air passing through is found very hot for it will convert paper into charcoal , & it is an explosive mixture for it will inflame if a lighted paper is presented to it; but it 8 134 is cooled below the explosive point by passing through wires even red hot & by being mixed with a considerable quantity of air comparatively cold. - The real temperature of visible flame is perhaps as the high est as any we are acquainted with. M r Tennant was in the habit of shewing an exp t which demonstrates the intensity of its heat. He used to fuse a small close filament of Platinum in the flame of a common candle & it is shewn by many exp ts that a stream of air which wil may be made to render a metallic body white hot & yet not luminous not be itself luminous - A considerable mass of heated metal lic matter is required to inflame even coal gas or the contact of the same mixture with an extensive heated surface an iron wire of 1/20 of an inch 135 9 red hot did not produce this effect when held horizontally over a stream of coal gas did not inflame it nor did a short wire of 1/6 of an inch produce the effect held in the same manner. but the same wire be of when six inches of it were red hot & when it was held perpendicularly in a bottle containing an explosive mixture to that heat was successively communicated to portions of gas produced the effect. - A certain degree of mechanical force which rapidly throws portions of cold explosive mixture upon flame prevents explosion at the point of contact thus on pressing an explosive mixture from a syringe or a Gum elastic bottle an explosive it burns only at some distance from the aperture 10 136 from which it is disengaged. - Taking all these circumstances into account there appears no difficulty in explaining the facts of the combustion of explosive mixtures within & not without the cylinders: for a current is established from below upwards & the hottest part of the cylinder is where the results of combustion the water Carbonic Acid or Azote which are not inflammable pass out; - the gas which enters is not sufficiently heated on the outside of the wire 11 to be exploded; & as the gases are no where confined there can be no mechanical force pressing currents of xxx air flame towards the same point. It will be needless to enter into further illustrations of the theoretical part of the subject & I shall conclude this paper by stating what I am sure will be gratifying to the society that the cylinder lamps have been tried in two of the most dangerous mines near Newcastle with perfect success & but there is from the communications I have had from the collieries there is every reason to believe that they will be immediately adopted in all the mines in xxxx that neighbourhood where there is any danger from fire damp. 12 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 5 147 Published in the Quarterly Journal of Science Vol. 1 p. 1 Date about Feb y 1816 On the wire gauze safe lamp for the preventing the explosions from fire damp & for giving light by lanterns in explosive xx mixtures atmospheres in coal mines by Sir H. Davy LL.D. VPRI FRSL & E &c The dreadful accidents of explosions which occur in coal mines are occasioned by the firing of light hydrocarbon carboretted inflammable gas which is disengaged during the working of the coals & from fissures in the strata & which when it has accumulated in any part of place in the mine so as to form more than 1/13 p t of the volume of the atmospherical air becomes explosive by a lighted candle or by any kind of flame. 13 148 |_ In parts of the mine where danger is apprehended from the firedamp the miners have been accustomed to guide themselves or to work by the light afforded by the sparks of Steel struck off from a wheel by Flint , but even this opportunity though much less dangerous than a candle sometimes produces explosions of the firedamp. - A perfect security from explosions accident is however offered to the miner in the use of a safe lamp which transmit its light & is fed with air through a cylinder of wire gauze & this invention 4 140 A comes in here I have described to the Royal Society the experiments which led me to this discovery the in a paper read to the that body I In the course have endeavoured to explain the principles of its operation of a laborious investigation In the course of a long & laborious investigation in the nature & communication of explosion flame I ascertained that explosions of gasses was incapable of being passed through long narrow metallic tubes & that by diminishing the length this principle of security was still obtained by diminishing their length & diameter at the same time at by likewise diminishing their length & increasing their number so that a great number of small apertures would not pass explosion when their depth was equal to their 5 148 150 diameter: - this fact led me to trails upon sieves foil of made of wire gauze or metallic plates perforated with numerous small holes; & I found that it was impossible to pass explosions through them. I have detailed in the progress of these researches & endeavored to explain the principle of the operation of flame sieves in some papers read before the Royal Society. - My object in this communication is to offer some practical hints to the proprietors & inspectors of mines & to the miners who may make use of the lamp. - 17 153 the coat of oxide which forms upon its xx which soon forms upon it superficially defends it from any the interior from the action of the air.- The cage or cylinder should be made by double joinings, the gauze being plated over in such a manner as to leave no apertures When the it is a cylindrical it should not be more than two inches in diameter as for in the larger cylinders the combustion of the fire damp produces a heat renders the top of the cylinder inconveniently hot;- but with narrow longitudinal cages - The bottom of the & a double top is always a proper 8 154 precaution fixed at the distance of 1/2 an inch or 3/4 of an inch above the first the first top -. The cylind gauze cylinder should be fastened to the lamp by a screw of four or five turns & fitted to the screw by a tight ring;- all joinings in the lamp should be made with hard Solder & the principle of security depends upon the circumstance that no aperture should exists in the contrivance apparatus larger than those in the wire gauze. The forms of the lamp & xxxxx cage & of & the mode of burning the wick may be greatly diversified but the principle is the which ensures their safety must always be regularly strictly attended to. a cylin A wire gauze cylinder which fits tight on the lamp like the covering of a box is safe most less safe than a screw only one attached to a screw because it may be bent so as to leave an unsafe aperture; & a double single double turn of a screw only gives less more security xxxx securing the lamp Fig 1st represents a wire gauze safe lamp of exactly twice the length & breadth that xxxxx they are constructed of a working lamp for the use of the miner A Represents the cistern which contains the oil B Represents the rim containing the female screw into in which the male screw to which the wire gauze cover is affixed screwed fixed & which xxxxx is fastened to the cistern by a moveable screw.

KK. are rings for car to hold or hang it by. When the wire gauze safe lamp is lighted & introduced into an atmosphere gradually contaminated mixed with fire damp the first effect of the fire damp is to increase the length & size of the flame. When the inflammable gas forms as much as 1/12 of the volume of the air, the cylinder becomes filled with a feeble blue flame; but the flame of the wick appears burning brightly within the blue flame; & the light of the wick continues till the fire damp increases to 1/6 or 1/5 when it is lost in the flame of the firedamp;- which in this case fills the cylinder within a pretty strong light. As long as any explosive mixture of gas exists 13 159 in contact with the lamp so long it will give light & when it is extinguished which happens when the foul air or the mixture of foul constitutes as much as 1/3 of the volume of the atmosphere the air is no longer proper for respiration; for though they animal will live life will continue where flame is extinguished yet it is always with suffering. Sparks from the Steel mill Flint & Steel fall red & without scintillation in an atmosphere which 14 160 would not support the flame of the safe wire gauze - safe lamp. - In cases in which the fire damp mixes only gradually is mixed only in its smallest proportions explosive proportion with air the use of the wire gauze safe lamp will xxxxx xxxxxx generally soon reduce its quantity below which rapidly consumes the inflammable gas which will soon reduce the quantity below the explosive point & it can scarcely ever very seldom ever happen that a lamp will half be full remain filled with the be exposed to an by an explosive. 15 161 mixture containing the xx largest proportion of firedamp but even in this case the lam instrument if absolutely safe it becomes hot & even should the wires become red hot they have no power of communicating explosion. - : I have exposed lamps to much more severe trials than they can ever experience in collieries passing through them currents of the most explosive mixtures of coal gas from the distillation of coal which is much 16 162 more inflammable than the fire dam & air; & I have even surrounded them with an explosive gas atmosphere containing a larger Double as much Oxygene as common air ; & though the wire sometimes became white hot yet no explosion ever took place, it must however be understood that this last & most severe trial was made on wire gauge having 900 apertures to the square inch. - Should it ever be necessary for the miner to work for some hours great length of time in a explosive atmosphere by the wire gauze safe lamp it may might be proper to cool the lamp 17 163 occasionally by throwing water upon the top or a little cistern for holding water might may be attached to holding water may be attached to which xxxxx will prevent the heat from being excessive. - When the fire damp is burning in the cylinder it may the flame may be easily extinguished by putting a cap of cotton metal or even woolen or linen over it. it: - The iron wire gauze cylinders gauze when in use will not be found to rust & when they are laid aside for any time they should be oiled & their safety should be 18 164 proved before they are used by plunging them into a jar or a barrel containing an explosive mixture of fire damp. - It is imposed by M r Buddle that in those parts of the mines where under his superintedence where the liable to fire damp is that suspected the wire gauze safe lamp alone shall for used & that. - By obliging the miners always to use a wire gauze sap lamps in those parts of the mine coal mines liable to fire damp 19 165 the explosions will be rendered impossible; if Persons appointed by the viewer should regularly daily inspect the lamps & supply them with oil; & to prevent the possibility of accidents from the removal of the gauze cylinders they may be fastened to the lamps by small padlocks, though. when as danger from such a cir the imminent danger arising from such a circumstance is obvious & evident , the precaution probably it may be hoped will be unnecessary. - -There are persons who always undervalue the resources of Science & who endeavor to lessen the importance of any benefit conferred upon humanity, such persons 120 166 have thought proper to suppose that in the actual trials of the lamps in the mines unforseen difficulties & dangers may occur, I am happy however to be able to state that they have been tried in the most dangerous mines in the neighborhood of Newcastle which are the most dangerous in G t Britain & Whitehaven with the most perfect success & to the perfect satisfaction as well as astonishment of the miners & when there now xx is that the general adoption of them is urged 21 167 by such intelligent & enlightened practical men as M r Buddle & M r Peele they can hardly fail of being generally used in all collieries liable to fire damp. They will then in every And there is every reason to expect reason to expect that they will secure the lives of a most useful class of men relieve their families from anxiety, remove a great weight of responsibility from the coal viewer mine agent & diminish considerably the expenditure of the coal owner.- Note * Wire gauze safe lamps for working & smaller ones for viewing the mines of different 22 168 [sketch of tube] constructions are made by M r Newman Mathematical Instrument Maker Lisle street .- The principle may be applied to many other uses. The safe lamp may will prevent accidents in gas manufactories spirit manufactories & warehouses & in all places where gaseous inflammable matter is likely to be disengaged & for the common purposes of light they will always prevent danger from sparks as well as flames 169 170 171 172 173 176 175 176 6 On Safety Lamps 1 177 6 A few additional practical Onservations on the wire gauze safety lamps for miners with some evidence of their use. I have already published an account of the researches which led me to discover that explosions & flame are incapable of passing through metallic tissues which are nevertheless very permeable to both light & air & I have described several contrivances for lighting coal mines in which inflammable Air is disengaged found all founded upon the same principle of security. - . The lamp which has been found most convenient for the miners is that xxxx xxxxx xxx composed of a cylinder 178 of xxxx strong wire gauze fastened round the flame by a screw & in which the wick is trimmed by a wire passing through a safe aperture .- The Lamps of this construction have been commonly used in some of the most dangerous mines in England for nearly five months during which time no accident has happened & no inconvince occurred as will appears from the testimonies of enlightened practical men attached to this paper -. Since I first published the account of the wire gauze safe lamp I have made a number of exp ts upon flame which have led to some new philosophical 2 179 views of this curious & important subject but I am able to add very little to what I have already done respecting the accounts of the lamp & which enable me to add some additional practical observations on in the absolute security of the use of safe lamps; In these pages I shall confine myself entirely to considerations which are of a practical kind. - but these I shall not & to some practical results which I hope will at present discuss & shall limit will be useful to the miner; these last myself to some practical observations will form the subject of the following sentences which connected with them. - I find that as the use of double cylinders of wire gauze so fitted arranged that the wires are parallel to each other occasion very little loss diminuation of light; & very much diminish the heat when 180 the fire damp alone is burning within the cylinder so that with double cylinders I have never observed the wire gauze to become red hot. - The double cylinder lamp therefore is preferable to the single one whenever it necessary to preserve a light for a long time in an highly explosive atmosphere; & it has likewise double twice the strength of the single cylinder lamp. If objections which have been made probably by persons who have never seen the lamps, against the weakness of the wire had really been valid it would have been be easy to have double the thickness of it; or to have treble or 3 181 even quadruple folds of wire with por bars perfectly parallel; xxxx Layers of Wire gauze for instance of 25, 26 & 27 apertures to the square inch in the cylinder of the common size when arranged with a little care intercept very little more light than a single layer. -. I have had two lamps made of perforated plates cylinders of copper perforated with numerous such apertures; but they are more expensive cylinders made of copper than wire gauze than cylinders made of copper wire gauze & not stronger when they are perforated so as to give the same quantity of light.- -..- I have had a lamp made of double wire gauze & with a copper chimney which can be raised or lowered so as burn larger 182 or smaller quantities of fire damp:- This lamp I find in an highly explosive atomphere may be made to burn in an highly explosive atmosphere without producing any considerable heat producing any considerable heat for any length of time & offers & it offers a convenient from form of a lamp for consuming the firedamp. - It does not appear from M r . Buddle's communications that the iron wire rusts in common use; had should this be found to be this been the case in certain mines copper wire might be foun may need, & in the double cylinder this material is only 1s is trifling & lamp its cost In the double even thinly plated wire plated with silver would not be so costly as to be an object in 4 183 a great object of expense In the double cy the price of the lamp. In the double cyli cylinder lamp the copper wire will never become red hot; & perhaps & I have had lamps made in which the gauze the best construction will be to were the inner cylinder was of iron wire & the outer one of copper or wire less wire. In the beginning of my researches I xxxxx thought of applying some compactions for coating for the wires (on the supposition that they might suffer from the action of the air assisted by heat & I have found some that answer very well. but I have found only one which so as for with the loss of entirely prevent by means of then any action of the air assisted upon them by heat; & I have made some exp ts on this subject. I found that a very frith glass made from of 184 When ever a single wire lamp is made to burn in a very explosive atmosphere the heat diminishes soon arrives at its maximum & then diminishes & the idea of the wire burning out, is shown to be unfounded the coaly carbonaceous matter produced tends to produced from the decomposition of the oil & of the gas tends to not only to prevent the oxidation of the metal; but likewise revives any oxide already formed - & this coaly matter when the lamp fire is burning in an highly damp is burning in the lamp. explosive atmosphere by choaking the upper appertures of the wire gradually diminishes the activity of heat combustion :- by gradually diminishing the quantity of gas consumed. -. In my early researches views of the safe lamp I thought that some vitrious 5 185 be incombustible composition a might upon to prevent be used as a coating oper to prevent the rusting of the wire & I made some exp ts on this subject. is fire I find that a fusible compound made easily made from of boracic acid & the earth called Baryta answer ed s the purpose of a coating very well; but I doubt whether such an application will ever be required & if such an application in any cases experience should prove that such an application is necessary it may be easily made .-. It is obvious that as long as the principle of security which is to admit no aperture in a lamp of more than 1/20 of an inch square is preserved 186 the construction may be almost infinitely varied; & the firedamp may be found throughout the whole of a cylinder or inflamed at certain surfaces only; & the light transmitted from other surfaces through horn or Mica or glass. I have had one lamp made of glass in which the fire damp burns round the wick only from a circular surface of wire gauze & which in an explosive mixture produce very less heat little more heat than a mixture burnt in the air pure air 6 187 in the common atmosphere, but the facility with which glass is broken & horn & Mica injured prevents me from recommending any lamps to the common miner in which these substances are used for the common purposes of the miner. by A chimney of sheet iron or copper I have tried a chimney of copper having wire gauze only in the exp t capped with a double wire gauze cylinder ; having & having fitted two thirds of its lower diameter for circumference opposite the flame open, & covered with wire gauze - This is an explosive mixture produced very 188 little heat; though it gave a tolerable light; & by increasing the im surfaces impermeable to air or by diminishing these permeable to air the heat may be reduced in any degree.* - The Rev. d When the firedamp is burning in the l -.* Whatever construction is adopted too much attention cannot be paid to the form of the * The Rev d John Hodgson has made a lamp of this kind upon the principle of the partial combustion of the 7 189 screw by which the cylinder or chimney is fastened to the lamp it ought to be strong & deep & to consist of at least three turns. - When the fire damp is burning in the wire gauze cylinders coal dust thrown into the lamp burns with strong flashes & scintillations fire damp with having a thick plate of glass in a metallic chimney opposite a wire gauze feeder, in which the supply of air is regulated by means of a slider. I found a model 190 it appears from that the miners were at first alarmed by an effect of this kind produced by the dust naturally caused during the working of the coals.. - I have made a number of exp ts on the effects of coal dust & as with which He sent me to answer very well; the only objection to such a form is the chance of the glass being broken when hit by a fall or by a drop of water when hot 8 191 is of other inflammable substances on the single lamps; but though I have repeatedly thrown coal dust, powdered resin, witch meal through lamps burning in more explosive mixtures than ever occur in coal mines & though I have kept these substances floating in the explosive atmosphere *2 & heaped them upon the top of the lamp when it was red hot yet I never could communicate explosion by means of them though in M r Hodgsons model the danger is diminished by the great thickness of the glass 192 - phosphorus or Sulphur or substances containing them are the only substances which can produce explosion by being applied to the outside of the lamp & for this purpose Sulphur to produce explosion the effect must be applied in large quantities & blown upon by a current of fresh air - It is needless would be absurd to caution the workmen against 9 193 heaping Sulphur , or gunpowder or pyrites which afford Sulphur by distillation upon their lamps; & the xxx such dust from these substances as can float in the atmosphere a thing itself scarcely possible cannot produce inflammation; for minute particles of ignited solid matter in inflammation have no power of inflaming the fire damp -; & I have repeatedly blown the free coal dust mixed with minute quantities of the finest dust of gunpowder through the lamp without common burning the explosive mixture 194 without any communication of explosion; if gunpowder grows in mass quantity is thrown upon red hot wires so as to produce a mass of flame; of course it will be very dangerous; but it is ridiculous & supposing danger with respect to gunpowder the Steel mill must be much more dangerous liable to inflame that substance than the wire gauze lamp:- & the double cylinder lamp offers perfect security against the 10 195 inflammation of any substance matter except Phosphorous that can ever exist in coal mines. In adopting 26 from 30 to 26 apertures to the inch 1 from 900 to *2 676 in the square inch & wires of from 1/50 to 1/40 of an inch in thickness; even single lamps are secure in all atmospheres of firedamp & even in atmospheres of co made explosive by coal gas which from the quantity of Olefiant gas it contains is much more inflammable than firedamp -; when a strong mechanical current of coal gas is driven from a p blowpipe indeed so as to make wire gauze of 676 apertures strongly red hot in the atmosphere, the flame from this pipe may be driven passed through it whilst it is strongly red hot; but this is owing to the power which ignited wires possess of inflaming coal *gas & they have no such effect on genuine fire damp:- & 11 197 a stream of gas burning in the atmosphere, acting on a small quantity of matter has no relation to a gas in explosion is entirely different from an explosive mixture at least uniform within the lamp. * Olefaint gas contains twice as much charcoal as light Hydrocarbonate carburetted Hydrogene & is much more easily decomposed by heat the broadness density of its flame as well as the density of all other flame as I shall shew on a future 198 Occasion depends upon solid matter charcoal deposited matter produced from the xxxxxxxxx by its decomposition in the process of combustion & which becomes ignited gives density to the light & the same circumstance holds good of all intense flames 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 7 Published in the Quarterly Journal of Science Vol 1 p.67.

MF 207 7 On the acid On Nitromuriatic acid Aqua Regia the or Nitromuriatic acid by Mr H Davy, LLD , VPRI FRS If strong nitrous acid saturated with nitrous gas of 15 be mixed with a saturated solution of muriatic acid gas in water, of the no other effect is produced than might be expected from the action of Nitrous acid of the same strength on an equal quantity of water & the mixed acid so formed has no power of action on gold & Platina . - Again if muriatic acid gas & nitrous gas in equal quantities volumes be mixed together over Mercury & a sulphurous half a volume of Oxygene be added 2 208 the immediate condensation will be no more than might be expected from the formation of Nitrous acid gas :- This is partly And when this is decomposed & partly or absorbed by the Mercury the muratic acid gas is found unaltered mixed with a certain portion of nitrous gas . - It appears then that Nitrous acid & muriatic acid gas have no xxxx chemical action on each other. - -: If Colourless Nitric Acid & Muriatic acid of the commerce be mixed together the mixture immediately becomes red yellow;& xxxx gains the power of 209 dissolving gold & Platinum -. If it be gently heated pure chlorine arises from it & the colour becomes deeper; if the heat be longer continued chlorine still rises but mixed with Nitrous acid gas which is much more absorbable by water & which may be separated from y e chlorine by a such quantity of water. When the process has process has been very long continued till the colour has becomes very deep no more chlorine can be procured. from it loses its power of acting upon gold & Platinum & nothing rises from it but a mixture of Nitrous Acid & Muriatic acid . - It appears then from these observations which have been very often repeated that 4 210 Mixtures of Nitric Nitro Muriatic acid is a mere mixture of Nitric & Muriatic acid owes its peculiar properties to a mutual the decomposition of the Nitric & Muriatic acid ; & that water chlorine & Nitrous acid gas are the results. & that the attractions which lead produce these results appear to be the attraction of Oxygene for Hydrogene to form water & that of Nitrous acid gas for water; - It is easy to calculate the quantities in which these products must be evolved according to the doctrine of definite 5 211 The correctness of these conclusions are still further proved by the circumstance that though nitrous gas & chlorine have no action upon each other when perfectly dry yet if water is present there is an immediate decomposition & nitrous acid gas & Muriatic acid are formed .- - It is easy to calculate the proportions quantity in which of chlorine is produced in Nitromuriatic acid are by the doctrine of definite proportions. - For for every 101 p ts in weight of Nitric Acid or for every equivalent to 118 p ts in weight of hydronitric acid decomposed 67 p ts of chlorine must be produced. - 6 212 -.

Observations on the two preceding papers & on some phaenomena in volcanic countries by Sir H Davy. VPRI FRS The Duchess of Montrose was so good as to send me the caustic lime which is the subject of the preceding analysis was sent to me by her Grace the which her Grace Duchess of Montrose who received it immediately from Tuscany .- It was in a bottle carefully sealed & full of water. Some of the exterior portions had become combined with Carbonic Acid & from before they were collected &:2 from 226 the colour it appeared that there were different portions of protoxide of iron in different parts of the substance. On examining the water it was found to be a saturated solution contain a quantity of Lime and it contained of fixed alkali a very similar xxxx fixed alkali but in quantities so minute that after the Lime was separated it could only be made evident only by coloured tests. It is evident appears from M r 3 227 Faraday 's analysis; that the water menstruum which deposits the solid substance must be a solution of silica in limewater & heat is evidently the agent by which the large quantity of Lime deposited is made soluble & is enabled to act on silica & the fact offers a new point of analogy between the alkalies & the alkaline earths. - Vestiges of extinct volcanoes exist in all the low countries on the western side of the Appenines 4 228 & the number of warm springs in the Tuscan Roman & Neapolitan states prove that a source of subterraneous heat is still in activity beneath the su beneath a great part of the surface in these districts. Carbonic Acid is disengaged in considerable quantities in several of the springs at the foot of the Appenines & some of the waters that deposit calcareous matter are saturated solutions of this 5 229 substance; Calcareous tufas of recent formation are to be found in every part of Italy ; the well know travertine marble Marmor Tiburtinum is a production of this kind; & the Lago di Solfaterra near Tivoli of which I shall give a particular account On a future number occasion of this journal annually deposits masses of this stone of several 6 230 inches in thickness .- -. It is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that the Carbonic acid which by its geological operation so modified the surface of Italy is disengaged fr in consequence of the action of volcanic fires on the Limestone of which the appenines are principally composed & liberated at their feet where the pressure is comparatively small; but - The action of these fires 7 231 Is must be generally below the surface at which the waters collected in the mountains find their way towards to the sea; - but in the instance of this water saturated with caustic lime it appears probable that the operation of the heat is operating or has been at operated above this surface. the Tuscan laguna offers the only instance in 8 232 which the action of these fires extends or has extended to the surface at which the water collected in the mountains finds its way to the sea; so as to enable it to dissolve caustic calcareous matter. 233 234 235 [blank page] 236 [blank page] 237 [blank page] 238 [blank page] 239 [blank page] 240 [blank page] lantern[/deletion] in which a very small bellows supplies air to a close lamp connected with the atmos phere by a tube containing a column of fluid.

I have already published an account of the researches which led me to discover that explosions & flame are incapable of passing through metallic tissues which are nevertheless very permeable to both light & air & I have described several contrivances for lighting coal mines in which inflammable Air is disengaged found all founded upon the same principle of security. - . The lamp which has been found most convenient for the miners is that xxxx xxxxx xxx composed of a cylinder 178 of xxxx strong wire gauze fastened round the flame by a screw & in which the wick is trimmed by a wire passing through a safe aperture .- The Lamps of this construction have been commonly used in some of the most dangerous mines in England for nearly five months during which time no accident has happened & no inconvince occurred as will appears from the testimonies of enlightened practical men attached to this paper -. Since I first published the account of the wire gauze safe lamp I have made a number of exp ts upon flame which have led to some new philosophical 2 179 views of this curious & important subject but I am able to add very little to what I have already done respecting the accounts of the lamp & which enable me to add some additional practical observations on in the absolute security of the use of safe lamps; In these pages I shall confine myself entirely to considerations which are of a practical kind. - but these I shall not & to some practical results which I hope will at present discuss & shall limit will be useful to the miner; these last myself to some practical observations will form the subject of the following sentences which connected with them. - I find that as the use of double cylinders of wire gauze so fitted arranged that the wires are parallel to each other occasion very little loss diminuation of light; & very much diminish the heat when 180 the fire damp alone is burning within the cylinder so that with double cylinders I have never observed the wire gauze to become red hot. - The double cylinder lamp therefore is preferable to the single one whenever it necessary to preserve a light for a long time in an highly explosive atmosphere; & it has likewise double twice the strength of the single cylinder lamp. If objections which have been made probably by persons who have never seen the lamps, against the weakness of the wire had really been valid it would have been be easy to have double the thickness of it; or to have treble or 3 181 even quadruple folds of wire with por bars perfectly parallel; xxxx Layers of Wire gauze for instance of 25, 26 & 27 apertures to the square inch in the cylinder of the common size when arranged with a little care intercept very little more light than a single layer. -. I have had two lamps made of perforated plates cylinders of copper perforated with numerous such apertures; but they are more expensive cylinders made of copper than wire gauze than cylinders made of copper wire gauze & not stronger when they are perforated so as to give the same quantity of light.- -..- I have had a lamp made of double wire gauze & with a copper chimney which can be raised or lowered so as burn larger 182 or smaller quantities of fire damp:- This lamp I find in an highly explosive atomphere may be made to burn in an highly explosive atmosphere without producing any considerable heat producing any considerable heat for any length of time & offers & it offers a convenient from form of a lamp for consuming the firedamp. - It does not appear from M r .

Observations on the two preceding papers & on some phaenomena in volcanic countries by Sir H Davy. VPRI FRS The Duchess of Montrose was so good as to send me the caustic lime which is the subject of the preceding analysis was sent to me by her Grace the which her Grace Duchess of Montrose who received it immediately from Tuscany .- It was in a bottle carefully sealed & full of water. Some of the exterior portions had become combined with Carbonic Acid & from before they were collected &:2 from 226 the colour it appeared that there were different portions of protoxide of iron in different parts of the substance. On examining the water it was found to be a saturated solution contain a quantity of Lime and it contained of fixed alkali a very similar xxxx fixed alkali but in quantities so minute that after the Lime was separated it could only be made evident only by coloured tests. It is evident appears from M r 3 227 Faraday 's analysis; that the water menstruum which deposits the solid substance must be a solution of silica in limewater & heat is evidently the agent by which the large quantity of Lime deposited is made soluble & is enabled to act on silica & the fact offers a new point of analogy between the alkalies & the alkaline earths. - Vestiges of extinct volcanoes exist in all the low countries on the western side of the Appenines 4 228 & the number of warm springs in the Tuscan Roman & Neapolitan states prove that a source of subterraneous heat is still in activity beneath the su beneath a great part of the surface in these districts. Carbonic Acid is disengaged in considerable quantities in several of the springs at the foot of the Appenines & some of the waters that deposit calcareous matter are saturated solutions of this 5 229 substance; Calcareous tufas of recent formation are to be found in every part of Italy ; the well know travertine marble Marmor Tiburtinum is a production of this kind; & the Lago di Solfaterra near Tivoli of which I shall give a particular account On a future number occasion of this journal annually deposits masses of this stone of several 6 230 inches in thickness .- -. It is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that the Carbonic acid which by its geological operation so modified the surface of Italy is disengaged fr in consequence of the action of volcanic fires on the Limestone of which the appenines are principally composed & liberated at their feet where the pressure is comparatively small; but - The action of these fires 7 231 Is must be generally below the surface at which the waters collected in the mountains find their way towards to the sea; - but in the instance of this water saturated with caustic lime it appears probable that the operation of the heat is operating or has been at operated above this surface. the Tuscan laguna offers the only instance in 8 232 which the action of these fires extends or has extended to the surface at which the water collected in the mountains finds its way to the sea; so as to enable it to dissolve caustic calcareous matter. 233 234 235 [blank page] 236 [blank page] 237 [blank page] 238 [blank page] 239 [blank page] 240 [blank page] it becomes hot & even should the wires become red hot they have no power of communicating explosion. - : I have exposed lamps to much more severe trials than they can ever experience in collieries passing through them currents of the most explosive mixtures of coal gas coal gas from the distillation of coal which is much",

I have already published an account of the researches which led me to discover that explosions & flame are incapable of passing through metallic tissues which are nevertheless very permeable to both light & air & I have described several contrivances for lighting coal mines in which inflammable Air is disengaged found all founded upon the same principle of security. - . The lamp which has been found most convenient for the miners is that xxxx xxxxx xxx composed of a cylinder 178 of xxxx strong wire gauze fastened round the flame by a screw & in which the wick is trimmed by a wire passing through a safe aperture .- The Lamps of this construction have been commonly used in some of the most dangerous mines in England for nearly five months during which time no accident has happened & no inconvince occurred as will appears from the testimonies of enlightened practical men attached to this paper -. Since I first published the account of the wire gauze safe lamp I have made a number of exp ts upon flame which have led to some new philosophical 2 179 views of this curious & important subject but I am able to add very little to what I have already done respecting the accounts of the lamp & which enable me to add some additional practical observations on in the absolute security of the use of safe lamps; In these pages I shall confine myself entirely to considerations which are of a practical kind. - but these I shall not & to some practical results which I hope will at present discuss & shall limit will be useful to the miner; these last myself to some practical observations will form the subject of the following sentences which connected with them. - I find that as the use of double cylinders of wire gauze so fitted arranged that the wires are parallel to each other occasion very little loss diminuation of light; & very much diminish the heat when 180 the fire damp alone is burning within the cylinder so that with double cylinders I have never observed the wire gauze to become red hot. - The double cylinder lamp therefore is preferable to the single one whenever it necessary to preserve a light for a long time in an highly explosive atmosphere; & it has likewise double twice the strength of the single cylinder lamp. If objections which have been made probably by persons who have never seen the lamps, against the weakness of the wire had really been valid it would have been be easy to have double the thickness of it; or to have treble or 3 181 even quadruple folds of wire with por bars perfectly parallel; xxxx Layers of Wire gauze for instance of 25, 26 & 27 apertures to the square inch in the cylinder of the common size when arranged with a little care intercept very little more light than a single layer. -. I have had two lamps made of perforated plates cylinders of copper perforated with numerous such apertures; but they are more expensive cylinders made of copper than wire gauze than cylinders made of copper wire gauze & not stronger when they are perforated so as to give the same quantity of light.- -..- I have had a lamp made of double wire gauze & with a copper chimney which can be raised or lowered so as burn larger 182 or smaller quantities of fire damp:- This lamp I find in an highly explosive atomphere may be made to burn in an highly explosive atmosphere without producing any considerable heat producing any considerable heat for any length of time & offers & it offers a convenient from form of a lamp for consuming the firedamp. - It does not appear from M r . Buddle's communications that the iron wire rusts in common use; had should this be found to be this been the case in certain mines copper wire might be foun may need, & in the double cylinder this material is only 1s is trifling & lamp its cost In the double even thinly plated wire plated with silver would not be so costly as to be an object in 4 183 a great object of expense In the double cy the price of the lamp. In the double cyli cylinder lamp the copper wire will never become red hot; & perhaps & I have had lamps made in which the gauze the best construction will be to were the inner cylinder was of iron wire & the outer one of copper or wire less wire.
