Few were my days of sunshine cried the sage Tumultuous pass the thoughts of former years Across my soul & sweet it is to think Of dangers past & sweeter still to see The closing day of life in sunshine clad. And fair with Thou ocean dark & terrible in storms My eye is closed upon thee, & I view The light of other days, the sunbeams dance Upon thy waves: the purple clouds of morn Hang on thy rocks resplendent.

To day for the first time in my life I have had a xxxxxx distinct sympathy with nature I was lying on the top of a rock in leeward, the wind was high & every thing in motion, the branches of an oak above were waving & murmuring to the breeze, yellow clouds deepened by grey at the base were rapidly floating over the western hills the whole sky was in motion, the yellow stream Agitated by the breeze below me was likewise flowing is this analogy? – Every",

For a moment my former ambition was awakened & the flush of rapture warmed my cheek on the thoughts of that people who had crowned my brows with the laurels of science & who had listened to the wild & simple harp of a son of the mountains – But this feeling was transient love domestic tenderness & the long train of ideas connected with hopes laxxxted to one spot resumed the empire of the mind. – I parted from aithe with sorrow I had none of those presentiments which the vulgar upon reflecting on the state of their minds before an event & after imagine they",
  "13": "have perceived when they modify & mingle their feelings. – The voyage was like most of my voyages uninteresting, bodily & mental pain coexisted. & I made no reflections of sufficient importance to produce effects upon individuals in general. I recollect that time appeared to me longer than usually doubtless because I connected a greater number of terms with expressing time with the passing ideas / though afterwards it appeared to me shorter than before because it was connected with no strong feelings",

M.B. cannot have any Knowledge of his imaterial principle & you both allow that matter is likewise an unknown thing, the question then is this whether thinking arises from the action of many unknown things upon each other or of one unknown thing upon many unknown things.
