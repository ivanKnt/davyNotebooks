The action of the irritable fibre and of course the effect produc'd upon it, is in a ratio compounded of the quantity of its irritability & the force of the stimulus. the same stimulus will produce greater contraction, on a fibre more irritable than on one less irritable & the irritability of the fibre being the same the action of the fibre will be greater upon the application",

The state of health or the tone of the fibre consists in a certain quantity of the irritable principle necessary to its preservation, to maintain this state, the action of the stimulus must be sufficiently powerful, to carry of from the fibre the surplus of this irritable principle which the blood is continually supplying - for this a certain equilibrium is necessary between the stimuli applied & the irritability of the fibre or b = c 2 d When the sum of the stimuli acting upon the fibre is not sufficient to carry of its surplus of Irritability, the irritable principle accumulates in the fibre, then is the irritability in the state of e xxxxxx Accumulation The irritability is augmented & the stimuli produce much stronger contractions, than in the state of health. -",
