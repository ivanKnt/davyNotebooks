There I had found the spirit of my early vision. I was desirous therefore of again passing some time in these scenes in the hope of reestablishing a broken constitution & tho' this hope was a feeble one yet at least I expected to spend a few of the last days of life more tranquilly & more agreeably than in the Metropolis of my own country Nature never deceives us, the rocks, the mountains, the streams, always speak the same language;",

He had passed the meridian of life & his health was weak like my own, so that we were well suited as travelling companions, moving always slowly from place to place without having a fatigue.

If I were disposed to indulge in minute picturesque descriptions I might occupy hours with details of the various characters of the enchanting scenery in this neighbourhood.

The fall of the traun fall of the traun fall of the traun about ten miles below Gmunden was one of our favourite haunts It is a cataract, which when the river is full, may be almost compared to that of Schaffhausen in magnitude; & possess the same peculiar character of grandeur in the precipitous rush of it's awful & overpowering waters & of beauty in the tint of its streams & foam & in the forms of the rocks",

Eubathes who was very fond of fly-fishing was amusing himself by catching graylings for our dinner in the stream above the fall. I took one of the boats which are used for descending the canal or lock artificially cut in the rock by the side of the fall, on which salt & wood are usually transported from Upper Austria to the Danube , & I desired two of the peasants to assist my servant in permitting the boat to descend by a rope",

In some moments the boat glided gently along the smooth current & I enjoyed the beauty of the moving scene around me & had my eye fixed upon the bright rain- bow seen upon the spray of the cataract above my head when I was suddenly aroused by a shout of alarm from my servant & looking round I saw that the piece of wood to which the rope had been attached had given way & the boat was floating down the river at the mercy of the stream. I was not at first alarmed, for I saw that my assistants were procuring long poles with which it appeared",
  "32": "easy to arrest the boat before it entered the rapidly descending water of the sluice; & I called out to them to use their united force to reach the longest pole accross the water that I might be stable to catch the end of it in my hand, & at this moment I felt perfect security but a breeze of wind suddenly came over the valley & blew from the nearest bank, the boat was turned by it out of the side current & thrown nearer to the middle of the river & I soon saw that I was likely to be precipitated over the cataract. My servant & the boatman rushed into the water; but it was too deep to enable them to reach the boat. I was soon in the white water of the descending stream & my danger was inevitable",
  "33": "31 I had presence of mind maybe to consider whether my chance of safety would be greater by throwing myself out of the boat or by remaining in it & I preferred the latter ex- pedient. I looked upon from the rainbow upon the bright sun above my head as if taking leave for ever of that glorious luminary. I raised one pious aspiration to the divine power of light & life, I was im- mediately stunned by the thunder of the fall & my eyes were closed in darkness. How long I remained insensible I know not. My first recollections after this accident were of a bright light shining above me of warmth & pressure in different parts of my body & of the noise of the rushing",

From this second sleep I was awakened by a voice which seemed not altogether unknown to me, & looking upwards I saw the bright eye & noble countenance of the unknown stranger whom I had met at Paestum . I faintly articulated \"I am in another world\" - No, said the stranger, you are safe in this. You are a little bruised by your fall, but you will soon be well.

Euthabes whom I saw now with an expression of joy & of warmth unusual to him, gave a hearty shake to the other hand & they both said \"you must repose a few hours longer\" after a sound sleep till the evening I was able to take some refreshment & found little inconvenience from the accident except some bruises in the lower part of the body & a slight swimming in the head. The next day I was able to return",

The Unknown The Unknown The Unknown The Unknown - Certainly not In dry seasons, they are seldom found here; but after great rains they are often abundant & I think it cannot be doubted that their natural residence is in an extensive deep sub- terranean lake from which in great floods they sometimes are forced thro' the crevices of the rocks into this place where they are found; - & it",

This animal I dare say is much larger than we now see it, when mature in it's native place; but it's comparative anatomy is exceedingly hostile to the idea, that it is an animal in a state of transition. It has been found of various sizes from that of the thickness of a quill to that of the thumb; but it's form of organs has been always the same.

This fact of their appearance during the night seemed to me so extraordinary that I could hardly avoid the fancy that they were new creations.

It was said at this time that no generative organs had been discovered in any of the specimens examined by physiologists & this lent a weight to my opinion of the possibility of their being actually new creations; which I suppose you will condemn as wholly visionary & unphilosophical Euthabes. - From the tone in which you make your statement I think you yourself consider them",

The waste of the body produced in muscular action, perspiration & various sensations, is made up for by the constant supply of nutritious matter to the blood by the absorbents; And, by the action of the heart the blood is preserved in perpetual motion through every part of the body. In the lungs or bronchia the venous blood is exposed to the influence of air & undergoes a remarkable change, being converted into arterial blood. The obvious chemical alteration",

The volumes of elastic fluid elastic fluid elastic fluid inspired & expired (making allowance for change of temperature) are the same & if ponderable agents only were to be regarded it would appear as if the only use of respiration were to force the blood from a certain quantity of carbonaceous matter; but it is probable that this is only a secondary object & that the change produced by respiration upon the blood is of a much more important kind - oxygen in its elastic state has properties which are very characteristic; it gives out",

My idea is that the common air common air common air inspired enters into the venous blood entire in a state of dissolution carrying with it it's subtile or etherial part,",
  "62": "which in ordinary cases of chemical change is given off; that it expels from the blood carbonic acid gas & Azote ; & that in the course of the circulation its chemical part & it's ponderable part undergo changes which belong to laws that can not be considered as chemical; the etherial part probably producing animal heat & other effects; & the ponderable part contributing to form carbonic acid & other products. The arterial blood is necessary to all the functions of life; & it is the less connected with the irritability of the muscles & the sensibility of the nerves than with the performance of all the secretions. - Eubathes .

I wish merely to induce you to pause & to hear my reasons: They may appear insufficient to you, but I am anxious to ex- plain them. First, then, in all known chemical changes in which oxygen gas is absorbed & carbonic acid gas formed, heat is produced I could mention a thousand instances from the contribution of wood, or spirits of wine, to the fermentation of fruit, or the putrefaction of animal matter: This general fact which may be almost called a law, is in favour of the view of D r Black D r Black D r Black . Another circumstance in favour of it, is, that those animals which possess the highest temperature",
  "64": "consume the greatest quantity of air: and, under different cir- cumstances of action or repose the heat is in great measure pro- portional to the quantity of oxygen consumed. - Then those animals which absorb the smallest quantity of air are cold blooded.

The Unknown. The Unknown. The Unknown. The Unknown. With the highest respect for the memory of D r. Black & for the opinion of his 'disciple, I shall answer the argument I have just heard.

Besides a distinguis hed physiologist has rendered it probable, that the animal heat depends more upon the functions of the nerves, than upon any result of respiration. The argument derived from the change of colour, is perfectly delusive. It would not follow if Carbon were liberated from the blood that it must necessarily",

No change in sensible qualities can ever indicate with precision the nature of a chemical change. I shall resume my view, which I cannot be said to have fully developed. When I stated that Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid was formed in the venous blood in the process of life, I meant mainly to say, that this blood in consequence of certain changes become capable of giving off Carbon & oxygen in union with each other; - for the moment inorganic matter enters into the composition living organs it obeys new laws.

Respiration is no more a chemical process than the absorption of Chyle : & the changes that take place in the lungs tho' they appear so simple, may be very complicated. It is as little philosophical to consider them as a mere com- bustion of Carbon , as to consider the formation of muscle from the arterial blood as crystallization There can be no doubt that all the power & agencies, of matter are employed in the purposes of organization; but the phenomena of organization can, no more be referred to chemistry than those of chemistry to mechanicks.

Those like all other notions of the same kind, appear to me very little refined.
