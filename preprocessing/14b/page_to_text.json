The Unknown Philo I shall willingly enter upon this subject. I cannot demonstrate to you what are the true elements of things; but I can exhibit to you those substances, which as we cannot decompose them, are elementary for us: mathematically considered, it appears possible to prove the infinite divisibility of matter; but our mechanical means of division are extremely limited. There is every reason to believe that our powers of chemical",

The test of a body being indecomposable is, that in all chemical changes it increases in weight, or its changes result from its combining with new matter. Thus when Mercury is converted into a red powder by being heated in the air, it gains in weight.",
  "12": "The test of a body being compound is, that in assuming new forms it loses weight; thus when the olive coloured substance called oxide of silver oxide of silver oxide of silver is converted into silver by heat, it weighs less than before but in all cases either of gain or loss of weight, the circumstance depends either upon matter absorbed, or matter emitted which is either solid, fluid, or aeriform and which can be always collected and weighted the metals, Sulphur , Phosphorous , Carbon , Silenium, iodine , Brome, & certain elastic fluids are the only substances which as far as our knowledge extends which can be neither produced from other forms of matter, nor be converted into them.

At some time possibly we may be able to solve them by an hypothesis which will satisfactorily explain the chemical phenomena; but as we can never see the elementary particles of bodies, our reasoning upon them must be founded upon analogies derived from mechanics, & the idea that small indivisible particles follow the same laws of motion as the masses which they compose.

A person in touching a shell fish observes that it emits a purple liquid, & applies this purple liquid as a dye. Hence the Tyrian purple.

It suits the indolence of those minds which never attempt any thing & which probably if they did attempt any thing, would not succeed to refer to accident that which belong to genius. It is sometimes said by such persons that the discovery of the law of gravitation, was owing to accident, & a ridiculous story is told of the falling of an apple as the cause of this discovery.",

Clays which are yellow are known to turn red; calcareous earth renders Flint fusible.

There is therefore every reason to believe that it was not the result of accidental combination, but of experiments made for improving or producing colours Amongst the ancient philosophers many discoveries are attributed to Democritus & Anaxagoras ; & connected with the chemical arts, the narration of the inventions of Archimedes alone, by Plutarch would serve to show how great is the",

Look to the progress of the arts since they have been enlightened by a system of science system of science , & observe with what rapidity they have advanced.

Adam Smith well observes that manufacturers are always more ingenious than Husbandmen; & manufacturers that use machinery, will probably always be found always more ingenious than handicraft manufacturers.

This doctrine which in its application to Chemistry has been called the atomic doctrine atomic doctrine , or theory, has been embraced by several modern Chemists; but the development of it is owing to M r Dalton M r Dalton M r Dalton , who seems to have been the first person to generalize the facts of Chemistry relating to definite proportions & to draw this inference from them.",
