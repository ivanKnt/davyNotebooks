The same friends Ambrosio and Onuphrio who were my companions at Rome in the winter accompanied me in the spring to Naples . Many conversations occurred in the course of our journey which were often to me peculiarly instructive and from the difference of their opinions generally animated and often entertaining. I shall detail one of those conversations which took place in the evening on the summit of Vesuvius, & the remembrance of the remembrance of which from its connection with my vision in the Colasaeum the Colasaeum the Colasaeum the Colasaeum",

I shall give the conversation in the words of the person- -ages of the drama. Philalethes . It is difficult to say whether there is more of sublimity or beauty in the scene before us. Nature appears at once smiling & frowning, in ac- -tivity & in repose, how tre- -mendous is the volcano, how magnificent this great laboratory of nature in its unceasing fire, its subterra- -neous lightnings & thunder, its volumes of smoke, its showers of stones and its rivers of ignited lava;",
  "7": "5 how contrasted the darkness of the Scoria the ruins and the desolation round the crater with the scene below, there we see the rich field covered with flax or maize or millet and intersected by rows of trees which support the green and graceful festoons of the vine; the orange & lemon tree co- -vered with golden fruit ap- -pear in the sheltered glens, the olive trees cover the lower hills, islands purple in the beams of the setting sun are scattered over the sea in the west & the sky is tinted with red softening into the brightest & purest azure; the distant mountains still retain a part of the snows of winter but they are ra- -pidly melting & they abso- -lutely seem to melt reflecting the beams of the setting sun, glowing as if on fire: and man appears emulous",
  "8": "of nature for the city below is full of activity, the near- -est part of the bay is covered with boats, busy multitudes crowd the strand, and at the same time may be seen a number of the arts be- longing to civilised society in operation, house building ship building, rope making the manipulations of the smith & of the agriculturist & not only the useful arts but even the amusements & luxuries of a great metro- -polis may be seen witnessed from the spot on which we stand, that motley crowd is collect -ed round policninello & those smaller groups that surround that surround round the stalls are employed in enjoying the favourite food & drink of the Lazaroni.

As we passed through Portici on the road to the base of Vesuvius it appeared to me that I saw a stone from which had an ancient ro- -man inscription upon it and which occupied the place of a portal in the modern palace of the Bourbons. Philalethes . This is not an uncom-",
  "12": "-mon circumstance most of the stones used in the modern buildings palaces of Portici had been employed & more than 2000 years before in buildings structures raised by the ancient romans or greek colonists & is not a little remakable that the buildings of Herculaneum a town covered with ashes, tuffa, & lava from the first recorded eruption of Vesuvius more than 1700 years ago should have been constructed of volcanic materials produced in some an in some an by some antecdent igneous action of the mountain in times beyong the reach of history; & that men should have gone on for so many ages making erections in spots where their works have been so often destroyed in- -attentive to the voice of time of the warnings of nature. Onuphrio . This last fact recalls to my recollection an idea which Philathetes started in the remarkable dream which",
  "13": "11 he would have us believe occur -red to him in the Colosaeum . namely that no important fact to which to which can be useful to society is ever lost and that like these stones which like these stones which tho covered with ashes or hidden by ruins it is sure to be brought forward again and made use of in some new form Ambrosio . I do not see the justness of the justness of the analogy to which Onuphrio refers: but there are many parts of that vision on which I should wish to hear the explanations of Philathetes. I con -sider it in fact as a sort of poeti- -cal epitome of his philosophical opinions & consider that consider that regard the vision or dream as a mere web of im his imagination in which he intended to catch us his summer flies and travelling companions. - Philathetes . Here Ambrosio you do me wrong, I will acknowledge if you please that the vision in the Colosaeum is a fiction but the most impor- -tant parts of it really occured to me in sleep particularly that in which I seemed to leave the earth & launch into the infinite of space under the guidance of a tutelary genius. And the origin and progress of civil sociey",

Of course we may consider them as an accurate representation of your waking thoughts. Philathetes. I do not say that they strictly are so for I am not quite convinced that dreams are always representations of the state of the mind modified by organic diseases or by associa- -tions. There are certainly no absolutely new ideas produced in sleep yet I have had more than one instance in the course of my life of most extraordinary combinations produced occuring in this state which have had considerable in- -fluence on my feelings, my form likewise parts of another",

Why Philalethes you are be- -coming a visionary a dreamer of dreams we should perhaps set you down by the side of Jacob Behman Jacob Behman Jacob Behman or Emmanuel Swedenbourg or Emmanuel Swedenbourg and in another age you might have been a prophet of have ranked even with Mahomet ; but pray give us one of those instances in which such a mar- -vellous effect was produced on your imagination or your health by a dream, that we may form some judgement of the nature of your second sight or inspirations and whether they have any foundation or whether they are not as I believe really unfounded creations of the fancy, dreams respecting dreams unfounded creations of the fancy, dreams respecting dreams visionary Philalelthes . I anticipate unbelief and I expose myself to your ridicule in the statement I am about to make yet I shall mention nothing but a simple fact. Almost a quarter of a century ago as you know I contrac- -ted that terrible form of typhus fever know by the name at jail fever, I may say not from any unprudence of my own but whilst engaged in put- -ting in execution a plan for ventilating one of the great prisons of the metro- polis, My illness was severe and",
  "16": "dangerous, as long as the fever con- -tinued my dreams or deliriums were most painful and oppressive but when the weakness consequent to the exhaustion came on, & when the probability of death seemed to my physicians greater than that of life there was an entire change in all my ideal combinations I remained in an apparently senseless or lethargic state but in fact my mind was pe- -culiarly active, there was always before me the form of a beautiful woman with whom I was engaged in the most interesting and intellectual conversation. Ambrosio . The figure of a lady with whom you were in love. Philalethes . No such thing I was pas- -sionately in love at the time but the object of my affection was a lady with black hair dark eyes & pale complexion: this spirit of my vision on the contrary had brown hair, blue eyes & a bright rosy complexion, & was as far as I can recollect un- =like any of the amatory forms which in early youth had so often haunted my imagination.",
  "17": "15 Her figure for many days was so dis- tinct in my mind as to form almost a visual image: as I gained strength the visits of my good angel for so I called it & became less frequent & when I was restored to health they were alltogether discontinued. - Onuphrio . I see nothing very strange in this a mere reaction of the mind after severe pain & to a young man of 25 there are few more pleasurable images than that of a beautiful and blooming maiden with blue eyes blooming cheeks & long nut brown tresses - Philalethes . But all my feelings and all my conversations with this vision -ary maiden were pure and of an intellectual & refined nature. Onuphrio . Yes I suppose as long as you were very weak. Philalethes . I will not allow you to treat me with ridicule upon this point till you have heard the second part of the story. Nine Fifteen 15 years after that recovery from this fever and when I had almost lost the recollections of the vision it was recalled to my memory by a very blooming and graceful maiden of",

Now comes the extraordinary part of the narration of the narration Ten 8 years after 24 years after my first illness at a time when I was exceedingly weak from a severe and dangerous malady which for many weeks threatened my life, and when my mind was almost in a desponding state being in a course of travels ordered by my medical advisers I again met the person who had appeared as the representative my visionary female and to her kindness and care & to the hopes & feelings created by the interest such a person seemed to take in my welfare I belive I owe what remains to me what remains to me my of life: my despondency gradually disappeared and tho my health still continued weak life began",
  "19": "17 to possess charms for me which I had thought were forever gone & I could not help identifying this living angel with the vision which appeared as my guardian genius during the illness of my youth. Onuphrio . I really see nothing at all in this fact whether the first or the first or I regard the first or the second part of the story beyond the influence of an imagination excited by disease. From youth even to age women are our guardian angels our comforters & I dare say any other handsome young female who had been your nurse in your last illness would have coinci- -ded with your rememberance of the vision even tho her eyes had been hazle & her hair flaxen. Nothing can be more loose than the images represented in dreams following a fever & with the nervous susceptibility produced by your last illness allmost any agreable form would have become the representative of your imaginary guardian genius. Thus it is that by the power of fancy material forms are clothes in divine supernatural attributes",
  "20": "and in the same manner imaginary divinities are clothed in supernatural are clothed in supernatural attributes have all the forms of mor- -tality bestowed upon them. The Gods of the pagan mythology are were in all their characters forms and attributes exalted human beings. - The demon of the coward & the angelic form that appeared form that appeared shape that to shape that to in the dreams in the dreams the fear xxx & dreaming eye the fear xxx & dreaming eye of some maid smitten by devotion & who having lost her earthly lover fixes her thoughts on heaven are clothed in the character and vestments of humanity changed by the dreaminess of passion - Ambrosio . With such a tendency Phil- -alethes as you have shown to believe in something like a supernatural, or divine influence on the human mind I am astonished that there should be so much scepticism belonging to your vision in the Colosaeum : And & your view of the early state of man, after his first creation is not only incompatible with revelation but likewise with reason & of every thing that we know respecting the history or traditions of the early nations of antiquity. Philalethes . Be more distinct and detailed in your statements Ambrosio that I may be able to reply to them.",
  "21": "19 Ambrosio . You make man in his early or first created state as savage like those that now inhabit New- Holland New- Holland New- Holland or New Zealand New Zealand New Zealand acquiring by the little use that they make of a feeble reason the power of supporting & extending life, now I contend that if man had been so created he must inevitably have been destroyed by the elements or de- --voured by savage beasts who were are so infinetely his superiors in physical force, he must therefore have been created formed with various instinctive faculties & propensities with a per- -fection of form and a use of organs fitting him to become the master of the earth: and it appears to me that the account given in genesis of the first parents of mankind having been placed in a garden filled with every thing necessary for their exis- -tence & enjoyment & ordered to increase & multiply there, is strictly in harmony with reason & accordant with all just metaphysical views of the na- ture of the human mind.

His reason is only acquired gradually & when in its highest perfection is often un- -certain in its results; he must therefore have been created with in- -stincts that for a long while sup- -plied the want of reason & which enabled him from the first moments of his existence to supply provide for provide for his wants to gratify his desires & enjoy the power & the activity of life.
