It is now almost the time when we should perceive the dawning of the eastern light, but from those heavy clouds, which obscure the whole of our horizon & from the long continued & dead stillness of the mountain I suspect that we are on the eve of some great change and a storm, if not an eruption is approaching so that I think it will be prudent for us to return to Naples .

P: It would be still more magnificent in the night when its high temperature would be more apparent, & when the dense white smoke rising from it would appear like flame from the reflected light. The appearance of the lava does not correspond to what I had expected to see, it appears liquid only at its exit from the mountain, and tho continually moving on it soon loses its charac- ter of a river of fire, & appears only a shape -less heap of enormous slags covered with ashes, & destroying everything that it meets in its course.

In the last conversation we had on Chemistry you explained to us the principles & laws of one of the most importnat of the active powers of matter, chemical attraction; in the scene now before us & those which we have lately witnessed, the antagonists to this power have been active; The principles of change, of repulsion & of projection in opposition to the principle of repose & fixity: the agents which in the persian mythology are considered as the destruction machines of Arimanes con -trasted with the creative & productive powers of Ormutz : it is now a good time for you Archteus to give us those scientific elucidations of the subject which we expect from you. As I must not allow your illustration of the re- pulsive powers as belonging to Arimanes as contras ted with the attractive or creative powers typical in Ormutz to pass without comment: you might with almost as much propriety have taken an opposite view of the subject: without change their is no life, without death there is no regeneration & heaped Heat, Light & those powers which depend upon repulsive energies are no less essential than attractions or gravitation in producing beauty and order of the system of the universe,",
  "9": "and in creating these living forms, which are perpetually renovated in nature. P. In what we see of fire we witness only its consuming & destructive agency. A. This I deny: and I might as well say that what we see of attraction on the side of a Glacier we witness only the principle of torpidity & death but the same kind of heat which sends forth the lava & spreads showers of ashes over the soils in its milder energy causes the river to irrigate the meadow, and sensds the vernal shower to fertilize the soils. P. What is this heat, and by what laws is it go- verned? A. You have proposed to me in the first place one of the most abstruse questions in modern science: there are great differences of opinion with respect to the causes of heat, but the laws of it or the series of phaenomena which it produces are tolerably well understood & have been scientifically arranged: there are two schools which have adop- ted each a different hypothesis respecting the cause of heat by one, which may be regarded as the School of Bacon, Boyle , Hooke , & Newton heat is regarded as a quality or property of which every species of matter is susceptible,",

By the other school which may be considered rather as belonging to continental philosophers, Leibnitz , Boerhaave , Stahl , Lavoisier , heat is considered as a peculiar species of very subtle matter, capable of entering into the pores of bodies & of separating them from each other & of likewise combining chemically with them altering their nature & their forms, whichever of these hypo- theses be adapted the phaenomena are capa- -ble of the same arrangement, for whether matter or motion be considered as communi. .cated theresults may be reasoned upon in the same manner. P. I find it almost impossible to avoid the con- -viction that heat is matter, the analogy between the particles thrown off by an odorous",

A. Nay my friend, I think you are reasoning too hastily: without motion as Lavoisier long ago expressed their can be no sensation, & a strong analogy from the senses might be brought forward against the opinion, which you adopt in so un. -qualified a manner: sound, we know, is produced by vibrations or undulations in the air and the laws of its communication & reflexion are much more analogous to those of the reflexion & communication of heat than any of the circum- -stances connected with the phaenomena of smell, besides Count Rumford excited by friction heat in a continuous manner for a great length of time & this constant exitation of Caloric if you please to call it so by mechanical means certainly throws some doubt over the hypothesiswhic you are so desirous of adopting Let me advise you therefore to suspend your opinion at least till you have attended a little more to the phaenomena of this agent. I shall just say a few words as to the laws",
  "12": "of heat in communication and afterwars I shall endeavour to describe the phaenomena presented by its radiation Heat is communicated from body to body but with very different degrees of velocity; those that transmit it with the greatest quickness are called good conductors of heat, metals are amongst the best conductors, metal -lic oxyds, Vitreous & strong substances, & vegetable and animal matter are worse conductors, & fluids in general conducts heat so ill that it has been even asserted by Count Rumford that they were nonconductors what is not correct: the effects of heat on bodies are all of the same kind, the first effect is that of expansion, an increase of the body in all its di- -menions, it is on this property that the thermometer is founded; a certain quantity of Mercury of which 100,000 parts at the freezing point of water become 101,832 parts at the boiling point is introduced into a narrow glass tube furnished with a bulb & a graduated scale which on Fahrenheits plan is de- -vided before the freezing & the boiling point into 180 degrees, in that of Celcius or the Centigrade into one hundred degrees & that of Reaumur into 80. by By a certain increase of heat solids become fluids, & fluids gases & by a diminuation of heat on the contrary gases are rendered fluids & fluids, solids; this law appears to be general",

Camphor a body naturally solid is easily rendered fluid by a low degree of heat & by increase of temperature becomes an elastic fluid elastic fluid elastic fluid & on the facility with which it undergoes this last change its odorous qualities depend; many of the metals are readily enough rendered gaseous by heat, Such as zink . antimony , Tellurium , Arsenic ; others on the contrary as Iron & Platinum do not assume this state at any of the temperatures we can command; some of the gases are easily rendered fluid by a certain degree of cold such as sul- -phereous acid gas sul- -phereous acid gas sul- -phereous acid gas & prussic gas prussic gas prussic gas , others require much lower degrees for this effect such as Carbonic acid Carbonic acid Carbonic acid & muriatic acid gas muriatic acid gas muriatic acid gas ; and there are elastic fluids which have resisted all the means of diminished temperature which have been applied to them even when assisted by pressure Bodies as I said before communicate heat with very different velocity, & they are like -wise affected by it in very different manners; the body in communicating the same quantity",
  "14": "of heat, as shown by its own diminution of temperature, to different bodies, affects them in very different manners & increases their heat to very different degrees, this is said to depend upon a quality called their capacities for heat, or their re- -lations to specific caloric, and a body is said to have a greater or less capacity in proportion as its tem- -perature is more or less raised by the addition or dimished by the subtraction of equal quantities of heat: In general the capacities of bodies for heat are greatest in the gaseous state, less in the fluid & least of all in the solid: you remember that I mentioned in a former conversation the atomic hypothesis, that all the chemical elements might be considered as composed of ultimate particles having a weight capable of being expressedly a number. M r Petit M r Petit M r Petit & M r Dulong M r Dulong M r Dulong have endeavoured to prove that the atoms of all simple substances have the same capacity for heat, or that the number representing their specific caloric being divided by the number representing the weight of their atom, gives nearly the same product.

P. I suppose the various mixtures & processes which I have seen for producing artificial cold must depend upon this same principle of change of capacity. A. Precisely so, when two amalgams which are solid become fluid by mixture cold is always produced & salt & snow, Muriate of Lime Muriate of Lime Muriate of Lime & snow acid & snow, all produce intense cold from this cause. From the same cause intense cold is produced when fluids such as ether, & alcohol of Sulphur become gases: by the evaporation of the alcohol of Sulphur the late D r Marcet D r Marcet D r Marcet suceeded in freezing Mercury",

Ancient Greece & Rome we view in the few miserable remains of their monuments: & the time will arrive when modern Rome will be what ancient Rome now is & ancient Rome or Athens will be what Tyre or Niniveh now Carthage are, known only by coloured dust in the desert or coloured sand, containing the fragments of bri c ks bri c ks bricks or glass, washed up by the wave of a stormy sea: I could can pursue these thoughts still further & show that the wood of the cross or the bronze of the statue decay almost as quickly as if they had not been sanctified & I think I could shew that their influence is owing to the ima -gination which when time is considered or the",

I have not the same exalted views on the subject which our friend A. has so eloquently expressed, some little of the perfect state in which these ruins exist may have been owing to the causes which he has described, but these causes have only lately began to operate & the mischief was done before Christianity was established at Rome Feeling differently on these subjects, I admire d this venerable ruin rather as a record of the destruction of a power of the greatest people that ever existed tha t n as a proof of the triumph of Christianity, & I am carried forward in melancholy antici- -pation to the period when even the magnificent dome of S t Peters S t Peters S t Peters will be in a similar state to that in which the Col isseum osceum now is & when its relics perhaps may be preserved by the sanctifying influence of some new & now unknown faith, when perhaps the statue of Jupiter which nows recieves the kiss as the as the of the devotee as the visage of S t Peter S t Peter S t Peter may recieve be applied to be applied to another holy use as the per =sonification of a future saint or divinity, & when the monuments of the papal mag- =nificence shall be mixed with the same dust as that which now covers the tombs of",

The size of the masses of travertin of which it is composed is in harmony with the immense mag- -nitude of the building. It is hardly to be wondered at that a people which constructed such works for their daily sports for their usual amusements should have possessed strength, enduring energy & perseverance sufficient to enable them to conquer the world: their They appear always to have formed their plans & made their combinations as if their power were beyond the reach of chance independent of the influence of time & founded for unlimited duration - for eternity! A. took up the discourse of O. & said. & \"The aspect of this wonderful heap of ruins is so picturesque that it is impossible to regret its decay & at this season of the year the colours of the vegetation are in harmony with those of the falling building & how perfectly the whole landscape is in Tone!

The society was as is usual in that metropolis of the old christian world numerous & diversified; In it there were found many intellectual foreigners, & amongst them many some distinguished Britons who had a higher object in making this city their residence than mere idleness or vague curiosity. Amongst these my countrymen there were two gentlemen with whom I formed a particular intimacy & who were my frequent companions in the visits that I made to the monu- -ments of the ancient grandeur of the old Romans & to the masterpieces of ancient & of modern art.
