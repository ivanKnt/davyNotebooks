These motions by association are made",

Walsh you know was considered as having proved the phenomenon to be purely electrical & M r Cavendish M r Cavendish M r Cavendish compared the organ of the Torpedo to a large surface very weakly charged & considered the effects as depending upon elec- -tricity in very large quantity but of very low intensity.
