  "4": "The Planet that we inhabit may be considered in its connection with the general system of the universe, as acted upon gravitation and revolving round the sun - It may be examined in the abode of organization and life covered with vegetables and peopled with animals, - or it may be studied as composed of different inorganic parts variously arranged and subservient to different uses.- It is under this last point of view that it is the subject of Geology - The Word is derived from the Greek language the Greek language it signifies the Science of the Earth Science of the Earth , but its acceptation is limited and it is only app applied to the branch of Knowledge branch of Knowledge relating to",
  "5": "The nature position and changes of the bodies that compose the known part known part of the surface of the Globe. The facts belonging to Geology are numerous The objects of the study are as many as the substances found in our soils our Rocks and our Mountains in the Sea and in the Atmosphere And the alterations that those great parts of our system are continually undergoin can only be explained on the principles of this department of Philosophy.- The information to be derived from Geology is applicable to many purposes - In a number of instances it may be made subservient to the wants of life And all the theoretical views belonging to it when accurately pursued lead to beautiful truths .- substances found in our vain our Rocks and",
  "6": "Fixed on the earth on the earth and dependent for our existance upon the various objects surrounding us Many of our necessities are supplied and some of our comforts produced by applications of the inorganic substances presented to us in Nature.- The soils from which we raise our vegetative nourishment the stones of which our habitations are formed are formed the fuel we employ for so many purposes and the metals absolutely essential absolutely essential to civilized Man to civilized Man are all subjects for the application of Geology of Geology And it is not merely their nature their nature which is indicated by this science but methods of discovering them and their extensive relations extensive relations",
  "7": "The rocks and stoney substances which are found beneath the soil, or which compose the foundations of our Hills though so various in their appearances yet contain many common substances.- The same bodies are found in very distant Countries There is an order in their position and the general nature of the mineral bodies belonging to a particular district, is in most cases indicated by the examination of a few specimens - In a mountainous country for instance if a stone of this nature occurs which is Granite there is great reason to suppose that this substance will be likewise found",
  "8": "found at no great distance but in such a position it would be vain to search for Shell Limestone Shell Limestone Shell Limestone or for Coal for Coal A gain (when Shell Limestone Shell Limestone Shell Limestone is found there is a strong presumption that soft-black slate or loose Sandstone will likewise occur in some contiguous spot and in such a country there can be little doubt that at some depth or in some direction Pit coal Pit coal Pit coal Pit coal would exist.- These circumstances which are fundamental facts of the science prove in a strong manner that considerable discoveries may often result from Geological",

But should He find sandstone a substance which to an uninstructed eye appears much of the same nature as Granite , it affords him immediate encouragement to proceed in his researches -",
  "10": "And a yellow of red sandstone on a soft slate bearing the impression of Vegetable leaves would offer indications almost certain of the substances sought for. For these Rocks are generally immediately incumbent on Coal.- Similar reasoning may be applied to metallic veins . The metals seldom or never occur in rocks of serpentine or Sienite or in soft coaly Shist nor in Sandstone nor in Basalt but they may be looked for in soft Granite in hard Shist in hard Shell Limestone Shell Limestone Shell Limestone . And if in Granite or Shist a vein of white stone is found remaining in",

And if veins of spar of spar occur in Rocks partly hollow and partly filled with a yellow substance of this kind which in Cornwall is called Gossan it may be always concluded that these veins will be productive and the larger the quantity of Gossan the better the indication. A number of Instances of the same kind might be adduced the study of the science is not useful merely useful merely to the Miner for as it explains the general Direction of Strata and the substances they contain",
  "12": "it offers it offers applications to many more of the Arts of the Arts of life. It ought to be studied by the engineer who is employed in the construction of Canals; as certain strata exceedingly hard are often with others very soft and easily cut through.- The drainer in order to make his operations successful ought to be minutely acquainted with the arrangement of the rocks in the district from which the springs arise springs arise that it is it is his business to divert - And the improver of land may often derive from Geology very useful instructions with regard to limestone , marble, Clayes their application and the nearest places whence they may be procured may be procured .",
  "13": "It is according to these veiws views that the study may be of National as well as of particul ar advantage - Such reasons shew that it is highly worthy of being pursued - and there are other reasons of no less importance though less obvious and more refined obvious and more refined which ought not to be slighted to be slighted in treating of its relations of its relations and general influence. These reasons These reasons will appear indeed perhaps more precisely more precisely to general Enquiries after inform to general Enquiries after inform ation for they depend upon circumstances which can scarcely fail scarcely fail to be equally interesting to every refined understanding -",

  "16": "The study of the constitution of the Globe of the manner in which its changes are produced and of the laws by which dead and inorganic matter are rendered subservient to the purposes of living beings affords some of the most sublime objects which can ever occupy our contemplation.

  "18": "The attainment of the Knowledge belonging to these highly interesting subjects is found subjects is found almost wholly upon observation ; for in a few cases only can instruments of experiment be applied be applied . And the acquaintance with mineral bodies which constitutes one of the most labourious and most interesting of the study the study may in almost every case be derived from an examination of their external characters. external characters. Geology perhaps more than any other departm of Natural Philosophy is a science of contemplation.-",
  "19": "It requires no experience or complicated apparatus no minute processes upon the unknown properties of matter; It demands only an enquiring mind ; and senses alive to the facts almost every where presented in Nature ; And as it may be acquired without much difficulty so it may be improved without much painful much painful exertion - The person who is devoted to Geological enquiries can scarcely ever want objects of employment and of interest. The ground on which He treads, the Country that surround Him surround Him and even the Rocks and stones removed from their natural",

In travelling He is attracted to a pursuit which must constantly preserve his mind awake to the scenes presented to it.- And the beauty the Majesty and sublimity of the great forms of Nature have their effect in the imagination rather increased.",
  "21": "Than diminished by beings connected with the views of Philosophy - The imagery of a Mountain Country which is the very theatre of the science is in almost all cass highly impressive and delightful but a new and a higher species of enjoyment arises in the mind when the arrangement in it, their harmony and its subserviency to the purposes of life are considered of life are considered . To the Geological enquirer every mountain chain offers striking Monuments of the great alterations that the Globe has undergone.",
  "22": "The most sublime speculations are awakened, the present is disregarded past ages crowd upon the fancy and the mind is lost in admiration of the designs of that great power who has established order in which at first view appears as confusion - It will not I trust be necessary to preserve these views to any greater extent. For sufficient I hope has been said to prove that the study is adapted to almost every mind and that any labour which may be bestowed upon it can scarcely be considered as vain.-",
  "23": "A very few words will be sufficient to explain the plan which is my intention to adopt in develloping the principles develloping the principles of the Science of the Science , and in rendering them plain and intelligible.- As it may be supposed that some of my hearers are unacquainted with many of the terms belonging to Geology and as most of these terms will appear Barbarous and are really difficult to be rememberd, I shall introduce them as gradually as possible beginning with the History of the Science",
  "24": "In this History the early opinions of the ancients concerning the elements of the Globe and their changes will first be discussed; and the more refined Theories of the Moderns which involve the outline of the science will be afterwards considered , and in the general details the opinions that are complicated will follow those that are simple and distinct. After the History of the Science the general order of the facts belonging to it will be explained will be explained the Nature of Rocks ans stones; and the relations of the different strata; and the changes that they are at present undergoing -",
  "25": "This part of the subject I shall illustrate as much as possible by large specimens by drawing and by picturesque sketches of the position of Rocks. From this last method much useful information it is my hope, may be derived may be derived . This painting will show the nature of the plan to be adopted. From the liberality of the Managers I shall be able to exhibit a number of the same kind and on the same scale and most of them will contain accurate portraits which will be the more interesting as belonging to the Island we inhabit.- After having examined the existing state of the Globe the Globe The last subject of the course will be the description discussion of the Theories",
  "26": "that have been formed to explain to explain the Nature and position of its parts its parts . The laws of their formation and the changes that they have undergone in the lapse of ages; and the principles and order by which the whole is continually preserved. It is this department of the science which will perhaps be the most interesting the most interesting . It is the one that offers the greatest objects of contemplation - It has most employed human ingenuity human ingenuity : and many of the Theories and speculations upon it exhibit brilliant examples of the most powerful gen efforts of Genius -",
  "27": "The task which I have preposed to my self in explaining all those various objects is one which in this Country I beleive has never been before undertaken and it is one connected with much labour and with many difficulties - As yet no elementary treatise has been published on Geology I have been obliged to form any part of the arrangement and to collect the different facts from very distant and very scattered sources - It is a subject in which very few only of its parts will admit of the arrangement of language of language of beauty of description of elegance of expression. I shall spare no exertions to make it useful and intelligible :",
  "28": "And in mentioning these circumstances I mean to apologise only for imperfections that cannot be avoided - The History of Geology History of Geology is a subject that necessarily leads us to consider the state of the human mind even in the elder periods of time. Man in his most savvage savage must have been strongly impressed with the forms, appearances and changes of the Earth and its diversified Earth and its diversified objects - And some of his earliest reasonings directed from effects to causes must have been connected with speculations on unknown times or xxxxxx alterations of matter and on the wonders of Nature wonders of Nature creation",
  "29": "In all the earliest systems of religions of the heathen Nations that have come down to the present times either by history or tradition certain doctrines are uniformly found relating to the formation of the Earth and its early Earth and its early changes - And most of these doctrines appear to have been in some manner derived from the grand account of the creation and of the deluge delivered in the sacred writings - The cosmogony of the Hindoes offers a remarkable instance and is quoted as such by Sir W m Jones from the account of the formation of the universe supposed to be given by Manu the Son of Brama Manu the Son of Brama Manu the Son of Brama to the Indian Sages.-",

  "31": "To an unprejudiced enquirer this passage must appear as a paraphase of the more simple and more sublime detail of the inspired writer - In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and light was.- The Early Egyptian Cosmogony according to a late ingenious writer Cap t Wilford Cap t Wilford Cap t Wilford is very similar to that of the Hindous and is probably derived from the same source; though the account of it is less distinct -",

  "33": "And new reasonings concerning the universe its productions the elements of matter and the causes of things must have been constantly awakened in the mind.- To common understandings alive to the impressions of superstition it is easy to conceive that all natural objects connected with strong feeling would readily be referred to some unknown divine power and hence the different parts of Nature represented Nature represented in an extensive mythology - And facts prove that prove that in nations the most distant this nr has actually taken place and in a similar manner;-",

  "52": "He developed, if one may believe Plutarch , what is now known to be the true causes of the winds that is to say a motion and change of place in the Air produced in consequence of the rarefaction of its lower parts by the solar Heat - Some of the opinions of Anaximander concerning the great bodies of the universe are exceedingly curious He is said to have advanced that the Sun is 28 times big as great as the earth In his age such an opinion was exceedingly",
  "53": "extraordinary but we should give him more credit for it if He had not said that the moon was 29 times as large as large - He conceived that the sun it self was not luminous but that its light proceeded from a hollow circle surrounding it - This idea might at first view be conceived to be very similar to that of a celebrated modern Philosopher . but the similarity will disappear will disappear when it is stated that the Greek considered the Elip Eclipses of the Sun as owing to the closing up of the orifices in the circle necessary for emitting light -",
  "54": "The doctrines of Anaxemander were taught after his death by his scholar Anaximenes , who made many additions and ventured to contradict generally the principles of Thales and to assert that Air and not water not water is the chief material element and that water is capable of being composed from Air adducing as a proof that by the condensation of Air rain is produced which when congealed becomes snow or hail appearing then as it were a species of species of Earth - But the greatest of the Philosophers of the early school was Anaxagorus who flourished in about 450 years before Christ",

He soon removed to Athens where He taught Philosophy for thirty years till He was banished from this celebrated City from the mere circumstance of his asserting that the sun was material was material and a mass of ignited substance.- Anaxagorous taught that one supreme intelligence was the creator and governour of the world. And Hence he was honoured with the title of Noss or the Mind and thus Timon speaks of him in verses quoted by Laertius which I have thus translated.- He spoke of one eternal living mind That all this glorious universe designed And from compassion made it rise and shine In order and in harmony divine.-",
  "56": "One of the most novel and the most remarkable of the doctrines of Anaxagorus was that He considered all bodies as composed of similar parts or essences; and that if the ultimate figure of particles could be obtained they would be found precisely similar precisely similar to the original body which they composed - This philosopher supported the Idea of three Elements Earth water and Heat - few are worth quoting are worth quoting The most remarkable of them perhaps is his speculations concerning the Nature of the heavenly bodies all of which He recorded as composed of Materials similar to those of the Earth and he endeavoured to prove",

Aristotle ridicules the notion for in those days as well as in the present times there were sceptics concerning the bodies beleived to have fallen from above - But Plutarch positively asserts on the authority of Damachus that in the second year of the 78 olympiad a large body of fire which emitted many flashes like shooting stars was seen to fall near the river Egos river Egos river Egos in Thrace and that it left in its place a large and dark coloured stone coloured stone and that such one an event and that other events",
  "58": "of the same kind would happen was foretold by Anaxagorus - The few facts that we are in possession of with regard to the first school of Philosophy in Greece proves that as far as their means extended means extended accurate observation was a guide to their researches; but their views were necessarily limited They were unassisted by experiment and instead of being rewarded for their most enlightened opinions they were constantly in danger of persecution The people of that period were wholly unprepared to receive the truths",
  "59": "of natural philosophy which opposed which opposed received superstitions - And in consequence as will be shewn in the next lecture the infant game of the science of observation soon faded and perished and then as if dazzled by the light afforded them by Nature soon closed their Eyes and found it more expedient more profitable and more conformable to the taste of the Age to amuse themselves with the visions of their own Creation -"
