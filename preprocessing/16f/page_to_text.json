Kind is red the Red Porphyry of this there is a large pillar in the British Museum The aspect presented by the porphyry in some measures resembles that of Granite ; but the blocks are smaller and the surface is almost always smooth. The masses of Porphyry are rarely large and hence insulated Rocks or cliffs of it seldom present much Majesty of form or variety of appearance but; when blended with wood and river scenery As it is in several vallies near Ben Nevis in Scotland the appearance is exceedingly beautiful and its high tints increase the effects of green of vegetation and The full light of the water .- Another primitive Rock which occurs almost as frequently as Granite and much more frequently than either porphyry or Sientite is micaceous shist - It consists principally of Mica whence its name but is likewise contains Quartz In its appearance it is one of the most splendid of Rocks. It occurs generally in irregular layers the effects of the green of vegetation and It occurs generally in irregular layers which have the appearance of leaves Instance There are two other species of primitive Shist for the name has been applied to several stones arranged in layers - These are Rocks of a simple constitution They are both opaque and similar as to aspect; but the one is so hard as not to be cut with a knife and the other is exceedingly soft . Instance The hard is named primitive silicious Shist and the other argillaceous Shist . All the primitive Shists in the exterior of their forms present considerable irregularities and their layers break in points in consequence of which when the Masses are large their outline is often very bold and impressive Serpentine is one of the primitive Rocks which occurs least frequently in Nature - It is simple in its constitution and is one of the most singular of mineral productions.- It is smooth to the touch is scarcely scratched with the knife and has a peculiar lustre Its colors are generally mixed and principally red and green which are diffused in streaks similar to those on the skin of the serpent whence its name It is simple in its constitution and Diffused into streaks similar to those on By the ancient it was called Ophite and was much used in ornamental works pliny who has given a detailed account of this stone attributes to it many wonderful virtues - Such as that of healing the bites of serpents and He recomended a piece of it worn suspended from the neck as an effectual guard against every species of enchantment - |_Serpentine at a considerable distance is easily distinguished by its aspect from all other Rocks - It occurs in masses which generally approach to the square figure and often present a number of small and irregular chasms - This sketch - The attempt has been made to delineate the aspect of serpentine in this group of Rocks N o 5 - Instance Serpentine is one of the primitive Rocks which contains the greatest number of perforations and of orifices caves And when it occurs upon a great scale its appearances are in the highest degree picturesque In the large masses of serpentine which as they exist in Nature form the cliffs of Cape Lizard in Cornwall nothing can exceed the variety of the colours and the smoothness and polish of the surface Red dark green brown and yellow all appear sometimes distinct & sometimes softening into each other - The white foam of the wave becomes a cause of contrast: And if Granite is the most sublime of the primitive Rocks in its form Serpentine may be with propriety be said to possess the highest character of Beauty . Quartz Rock forming immense masses occurs in some primitive districts - It is granular in its fracture and sometimes mixed with small quantities of Mica . In its aspect it appears in layers or in imperfect blocks having a four sided form.- Instance This Quartz mountain is of a pure white and when it is first considered at a distance it appears amongst the other mountains as if cloathed in perpetual snows - The curved lines of the strata that compose it are very beautiful and when illuminated by the sun the white light from it produces the highest effect of brilliancy and splendour It was once doubted whether any Limestone existed free from shells - but the most accurate researches have lately demonstrated that there are undoubted primitive Rocks of this substance found contiguous to the other primitive Rocks , Primitive marble differs from common marble not only in being free from organic remains but likewise in its fracture : which is soft and grained or like that of loaf sugar - & it is composed of minute chrystals of Calcareous Spar - Cal: Spar - Its colours are various it is so soft as to be scratched with a knife and it effervesces Copiously when thrown into Vinegar Instance The statuary marble of the ancients is primitive Limestone The aspect of white primitive Limestone is somewhat similar to that of Quartz Rock but its lustre is less considerable Instance It is almost always arranged in strata it seldom presents a rough outline Its forms are curved and its declivities gentle.- These are the principal Rocks that form the solid foundations of the surface at the Earth there are many varieties of them: and there are some other stoney substances that occur mixed with them; but I have thought it necessary in this lecture to attend only to the nature of the great principal Masses and to endeavour to fix your attention upon their decided characters On a future occasion I shall fully examine the other primitive substances the stones that exist blended with the primitive Rocks either in beds or veins the metalic ores that they contain and their indications The primitive Rocks in their position with regard to each other seldom occur precisely in the same arrangement Granite is the Rock usually found at the greatest depth and it is generally connected with micaceous shist with Sienite or with Quartz Serpentine Shist and granular Limestone often accompany each other: but Serpentine and granular Limestone seldom occur either incumbent upon or alternating with Granite .- Thus in Cornwall which is most distinctly a primitive Country The Granite and micaceous and silicious Shist meet and form the principal Rocky basis of the land - The Limestone occurs only in alternation with or upon the Shist and the Serpentine district is bounded on one side by micaceous Shists and on the other side by Sientite - Instance In Scotland in the great mountain chain of the western Isles as Highlands of which a part is represented in the back ground of this picture The Highest mountain in the island Ben Nevis and which rises 4500 feet is micaceous shist the next marked 2 is Quartz Rocks and Granite and Porphyry forms the other mountain - and the serpentine and marble in Scotland are usually found low and at the bottom of Hills of micaceous shist or Sienite - There is a similar arrangement in other great mountain chains - Thus in the highest eminence of the Alps which is represented in this sketch - The principle Rocks are Sienite Granite and micaceous shist - and Granite forms the great basis of Mont Blanc - A number of Geological descriptions which demonstrate the same facts may be found in writings of M r de Luc and of De Saussure but it will be unnecessary for me to multiply the instances as they are in most cases analagous - All the details of M. de Saussure upon the Alps are however in the highest degree worthy of being perused on account of their relation to the structure of the Globe.- This excellent man constantly studied Nature with the views of a true Philosopher .- He seldom indulged in speculation - His Theories are few and founded wholly upon his own observations. And his narratives are composed with a simple and unaffected eloquence which proves that he taught sought rather to communicate knowledge than to excite admiration.- The different primitive Rocks have very different modes of junction and of transition into each other.- In some cases the parts of their union one in right lines a circumstance which often occurs in the meeting of silicious Shist and Granite and porphyry - Instance Serpentine Sientite and micaceous shist sometimes pass into each other by very gentle gradations And where granular Limestone is placed upon micaceous shist near the point of junction it uniformly contains larger or smaller proportions of Mica - Granite and micaceous shist sometimes have their parts mixed at the point of junction and in other cases they inosculate sending forth distinct ramifications of Veins. Instance This fact occurs on a considerable scale at St Michaels Mount in Cornwall ;- The great body of the mountain is of Granite ; but at its base a stratum of the Shist occurs : and this layer of Granite may be traced to a considerable extent running into the Shist . whilst. ramifications of the Shist in many places penetrate into the Granite Those in oscu lations of Granite and Shist which occur abundantly in different parts of the world have been subjects of great disputes great disputes amongst the various Theorists Werner and most of his disciples considering them as veins of Granite attempts to show that they are Granite of a different kind from that which forms the first of the Rocks deposited by chrystalization and that they are of secondary order and formed by a much later infiltration of Water To the Huttonians they offer a strong argument in favour of the formation of Granite by ingenous fusion .- The Rock in which a Vein is found says D r Hutton must have been prior in existence to the vein itself therefore the Granite must have been formed after the Shist ,- And as the chasm in the Shist has been completely filled by the Granite this substance must have been fluid And their exist no agent but fire adequate to its fusion and to its projection into the Shist Neither the reasonings adopted in the one theory or in the other will I conceive carry conviction to the cool observer and unprejudiced observer . The Granite veins (if they be allowed the name) are almost always similar in their appearance to the Granite Rock with which they are connected : and this cannot even by the Wernerians be called with any plausibility a secondary Rock : With regard to D r Huttons oppinion It is true that where single and extensive veins inculated veins occur in large Rocks : the Rock must be considered as primary in its formation when compared with the vein : But in a case when two Rocks composed of very similar materials merely blend by ramification it is not necessary to suppose them of different periods of formation .- For there are many cases of Chystaliza- -tion in which different salts that solidify at the same time form their solution inosculate with each other and produce effects not dissimilar to those observed in the mixture of the primitive Rocks - On the extensive ground of opinion I confess that the general structure and appearances of the primitive Rocks offer very few facts favourable to either Hypothesis .- For as I have already said their principal materials are neither fusible by fire nor soluble in water - As yet no particle of pure Quartz has been rendered fluid by the strongest Heat of our furnaces assisted by the most powerful effects of Air : And it is therefore scarcely possible to believe that mountains of this stone more than a mile in perpendicular height and many miles in circumference can have been rendered fluid by subterraneous Heat excited without the access of Air and supposed to act even immediately beneath the water of the Ocean . There is indeed another strong argumen against the primitive Rocks having been formed by fire from the remains of former Continents and islands . Coal or carbonaceous matter is one of the substances very abundant upon the surface and in its pure form it is an element incapable of being produced and not in the slightest degree volatile by Heat And it ought therefore (assuming the probability of the theory of D r Hutton ) to be found in or amongst the groupes of primitive substances , with Granite with micaceous shist and with the serpentine and granular Limestone but this in fact is not the case , And in almost all the mountain chains scarcely any vestiges of Coaly matter occurs And in no part do they exhibit any marks of having been produced from the rivers of a former system containing organized beings and fitted for the purposes of life.- If the Huttonian or Platonic Theory of the formation of primitive Rocks be founded And they make the same agent at once the dissolving menstruum and the chrystalizing power.- Wherever natural causes can be fairly investigated it is the business of Philosophy to endeavour to trace them : And where we can perceive no certain indications of a prior arrangement there it is reasonable for us to rest there it is reasonable for us to fix the foundations of our Science . When Newton applied his powerful genius to the development of the laws of the planetary system; He did not begin his researches by endeavouring to develop how they received their present forms or how they were endowed with powers of motion with true sagacity He left those questions untouched and instead of indulging in conjectures and of expressing himself to the censure of being a Vague Theorist - He was contented with the arrangement of known phenomena and the explanation of nature by analogy compared with facts And in consequence He had the Glory of having discovered some of the most extensive and most sublime of physical truths - Such an example may be successfully imitated in all researches In the study of the chemical History of the Earth xx the first object of enquiry ought to be the present-state of things When this is accurately understood just deductions of reason will necessarily arise with regard to the past and the future If D r Hutton and M r Werner had contented themselves with explaining those operations by which our Globe is constantly preserved as a habitable World in the series of events at present taking place , they would have deserved a much higher praise than that of having been the founders of ingenious Hypotheses But when in attempting to explain appearances they attribute to agents powers which they have never been observed to exert, or refer to effects to causes the operation of which they are ignorant of their suppositions so not merit the name of Science: - Such speculations however brilliant will pass away and be forgotten ; Whilst the facts that have been connected with them will remain and become the parts of the more permanent Theory and of one more conformable to the true order of Nature .- In the present state of our knowledge we are wholly unable to explain the origin of primitive Rocks - But many interesting and attainable objects are presented to us in the study of their composition of the agencies to which their present state is owing and of their general uses in the Oeconomy of Nature .- The appearance of primitive Rocks are almost infinitely diversified and yet their constituent parts are comparatively few.- By the refined methods of Chemistry even the hardest stones are capable of being brought into solution and their elements separated from each other.- This fluid contains the matter of Quartz Rock dissolved in an alkaline lixivum And by means of an acid the earth that it contains may be seperated in a finely divided state - By other analogous methods which were exhibited in the Autumnal course of Lectures on chemical analysis ; may the constituent principles of other Rocks be separated from each other and obtained in a form of purity And by such experimental processes it is demonstrated that almost the varieties of the primitive Rocks that have been described consist chiefly of different combinations of four elementary earths, called Silex alumine Lime and Magnesia and a small quantity of Iron combined with Oxygene or pure Air .- alumine in its pure state and chrystalized form exists in the Sapphire - silicious earth in Rock chrystal - And caustic Magnesia and Lime as they are usually offered to our attention are the undecompounded substances known by chemists under these denominations.- In feld spar the silicious earth is combine d with small quantities of the other primitive earths and when coloured it owes its tint to the combined Oxide of Iron - Mica principally contains silicious earth and aluminous earth with a little Magnesia and Oxide of Iron is its colouring nature In Hornblende and shoerl the quantity of iron is greater In serpentine there is a considerable proportion of Magnesia united to the other earths - But white Limestone consists of pure Lime united to an elastic fluid called Carbonic Acid or fixed air whence its effervescence when acted on by an acid and the coloured Limestone owe their tints to Oxide of Iron The elementary earths that form the constituent parts of Rocks not only differ from each other in their general properties but likewise in their chemical attractions by which they are united.- And hence indications of the composition of Stone may in most cases be gained from their external properties - Thus the chrystalized stones that principaly contain alumine and Silex substances that have a very strong affinity for each other are always very hard and difficult to be broken And the greater their hardness the greater the proportion of alumine - The stones that contain Magnesia with alumine and Silex on the contrary are usually soft - And Magnesia has no attraction for Silex and only a slight one for alumine - And limestone which is soft the softest of all the primitive Rocks contains Lime united by a weak power of combination to an elastic fluid - At this time I can only mention these objects information concerning them may be found in most of the elementary books of chemistry - They are connected with Geology but are not proper subjects for extensive discussion in a Geological course The powers of decomposition in the possession of chemistry are very extensive but those of composition are exceedingly limited As yet none of the arrangements of the primitive materials of the Globe have been united by human invention . We recognize the laws of attraction by which they exist but we are wholly incapable of explaining the manner in which their principles combine . And this part of the enquiry concerning their essence is as yet hidden under the same veil that conceals the minute facts concerning their origin.- The primitive Rocks and mountains the structure of which has been described often occurs in chasms which extend for many hundred miles;- And their Geographical position is of considerable importance in the general order of Natural events - The Heat of the air is derived from the agency of the rays of the Sun upon the surface of the earth and it diminishes in proportion to the height so that the Atmosphere at three or four miles high is intensely cold - Hence the temperature of mountains is always much lower than that of plains - And in all climates of the Globe when they are above 15 thousand feet high their tops are covered with perpetual Snow - And the height of the point of congelation diminishes in a regular progression from the equator towards the poles so that in our latitude it is about five thousand feet Ben Nevis being very little within the limits of constant ice - It is in consequence of this circumstance that mountain chains affect in a high degree the temperature of the climate in which they exist - In the summer currents of cold air are continually flowing down their sides which mitigate the burning heat of the season In winter they influence the course of the winds so as in many cases to protect the plains from their effects - In Britain for instance the principal mountains occur in the North and North East part of the Island . And our hottest winds in summer and our coldest winds in winter blow from those quarters so that their situation is well adapted to diminish the heat in the one case and to break the force of the cold blast in the other case - North America as is well know is much colder in winter and hotter in summer than the parts of Europe under the same parallels of Latitude And this seems in great measure to be owing to the inferiority of its mountains which are few in number and none of which can be compared in height to the Pyrenees or the Norwegian Alps and much less to the Alps of Switzerland In South America the great chain of the Andes though partly under the Equator considerably tends to diminish the temperature of the climate and to render it habitable : And upon a smaller scale it may be said that the most fertile of the trophical islands and those the most luxuriant in vegetation are such as present the most mountainous aspect.- The effects of Mountains upon the temperature of climates are extensive and they possess other agencies perhaps still more importa nt In consequence of their low temperature They are constantly precipitating moisture from the Air or arresting the Clouds in their progress or from the thawing of Snow upon them they are sources of springs and rivers - And the streams proceeding from them which at their origin flow only over bare Rocks and water only moss or the become in their progress the cause of the fertility of the rich Valleys and produce the verdure of the cultivated plain.- Even those strata which have no elevation and which are buried beneath the Surface act in preserving the consistency of the soil and they prevent water and the matter capable of being organiz organized from penetrating to too great a depth in the earth where they would be placed out of the reach of plants and deprived of the influence of the Atmosphere and of light - By the irregularities in the exterior of the Earth the whole quantity of surface is considerably increased . And those parts of it which are not covered with living beings are still in some measure subservient to their existence and to their enjoyment - Blank page Blank page an insulated body of nearly 40 feet in{/deletion] circumference and so exactly poised upon circumference and so exactly poised upon",

  "38": "Granite and micaceous shist micaceous shist micaceous shist sometimes have their parts mixed at the point of junction and in other cases they inosculate sending forth distinct ramifications of Veins. Instance This fact occurs on a considerable scale at St Michaels Mount Michaels Mount Michaels Mount in Cornwall ;- The great body of the mountain is of Granite of Granite ; but at its base a stratum of the Shist occurs : and this layer of Granite may be traced to a considerable extent running into the Shist . whilst. ramifications whilst. ramifications of the Shist in many places penetrate places penetrate into the Granite Those in oscu lations of Granite and Shist which occur abundantly in different parts of the world have been subjects of great disputes great disputes",
  "39": "great disputes amongst the various Theorists Werner and most of his disciples considering them as veins of Granite veins of Granite attempts to show that they are Granite of a different kind from that which forms the first of the Rocks deposited by chrystalization and that they are of secondary order and formed by a much later infiltration of Water To the Huttonians they offer a strong argument in favour of the formation of Granite by ingenous fusion ingenous fusion .- The Rock in which a Vein is found says D r Hutton D r Hutton D r Hutton must have been prior in existence to the vein itself therefore the Granite must have been formed after the Shist ,-",
  "40": "And as the chasm in the Shist has been completely filled by the Granite by the Granite this substance must have been fluid And their exist no agent but fire adequate to its fusion and to its projection into the Shist Neither the reasonings adopted in the one theory or in the other will I conceive carry conviction to the cool observer and unprejudiced observer and unprejudiced observer . The Granite veins (if they be allowed the name) are almost always similar in their appearance to the Granite Rock with which they are connected :",
  "41": "and this cannot even by the Wernerians be called with any plausibility a secondary called with any plausibility a secondary Rock : With regard to D r Huttons oppinion It is true that where single and extensive single and extensive veins inculated veins occur in large Rocks inculated veins occur in large Rocks : the Rock must be considered as primary in its formation when compared with the compared with the vein : But in a case when two Rocks composed of very similar materials merely blend by ramification it is not necessary to suppose them of different periods of formation .- For there are many cases of Chystaliza- -tion in which different salts that solidify",
  "42": "at the same time form their solution inosculate with each other and produce effects not dissimilar to those observed in the mixture of the primitive Rocks - On the extensive ground of opinion I confess that the general structure and appearances of the primitive Rocks offer very few facts favourable to either Hypothesis either Hypothesis .- For as I have already said already said their principal materials are neither fusible by fire nor soluble in water - As yet no particle of pure Quartz has been rendered fluid by the",
  "43": "strongest Heat of our furnaces assisted by the most powerful effects of Air effects of Air : And it is therefore scarcely possible to believe that mountains of this stone this stone more than a mile in perpendicular height and many miles in circumference can have been rendered fluid by subterraneous Heat excited without the access of Air access of Air and supposed to act even immediately beneath the water of the Ocean beneath the water of the Ocean . There is indeed another strong argumen against the primitive against the primitive Rocks having been formed by fire from the remains of former Continents and islands .",
  "44": "Coal or carbonaceous matter is one of the substances very abundant very abundant upon the surface and in its pure form it is an element incapable of being produced being produced and not in the slightest degree volatile by Heat by Heat And it ought therefore (assuming the probability of the theory of D r Hutton D r Hutton D r Hutton ) to be found in or amongst the groupes of primitive substances , with Granite with micaceous shist micaceous shist micaceous shist and with the serpentine and granular Limestone but this in fact is not the case is not the case , And in almost all the mountain chains scarcely any vestiges of Coaly matter occurs",
  "45": "And in no part do they exhibit any marks of having been produced from the rivers of a former system containing organized beings and fitted for the purposes of life.- If the Huttonian or Platonic Theory of the formation of primitive Rocks be founded",
  "46": "And they make the same agent at once at once the dissolving menstruum and the chrystalizing power.- Wherever natural causes can be fairly investigated it is the business of Philosophy to endeavour to trace them trace them :",
  "47": "And where we can perceive no certain indications of a prior arrangement there it is reasonable for us to rest there it is reasonable for us to fix the foundations of our Science our Science . When Newton applied his powerful genius to the development of the laws of the planetary system; He did not begin his researches by endeavouring to develop how they received their present forms or how they were endowed with powers of motion with true sagacity He left those questions untouched and instead of indulging in conjectures and of expressing himself to the censure of being a Vague Theorist -",
  "48": "He was contented with the arrangement of known phenomena and the explanation of nature by analogy compared with facts And in consequence He had the Glory of having discovered some of the most extensive and most sublime of physical truths - Such an example Such an example may be successfully imitated in all researches In the study of the chemical History of the Earth xx the first object of enquiry ought to be the present-state of things the present-state of things When this is accurately understood just deductions just deductions of reason will necessarily arise with regard to the",
  "49": "past and the future and the future If D r Hutton D r Hutton D r Hutton D r Hutton and M r Werner M r Werner M r Werner M r Werner had contented themselves with explaining those operations those operations by which our Globe is constantly preserved as a habitable World in the series of events at present taking place taking place , they would have deserved a much higher praise than that of having been the founders of ingenious Hypotheses But when in attempting to explain appearances they attribute to agents to agents powers which they have never been observed to exert, or refer to effects to causes the operation of which they are ignorant",
  "50": "of their suppositions so not merit the name of Science: - Such speculations however brilliant will pass away and be forgotten and be forgotten ; Whilst the facts that have been connected with them will remain and become the parts of the more permanent Theory and of one more conformable to the true order of Nature order of Nature .- In the present state of our knowledge we are wholly unable to explain the origin of primitive Rocks - But many interesting and attainable interesting and attainable objects are presented to us in the study of their composition their composition of the agencies",
  "51": "to which their present state is owing and of their general uses in the Oeconomy of Nature .- The appearance of primitive Rocks are almost infinitely diversified and yet their constituent parts are comparatively few.- By the refined methods of Chemistry even the hardest stones are capable of being brought being brought into solution into solution and their elements separated from each other.- This fluid contains the matter of Quartz Rock dissolved in an alkaline lixivum alkaline lixivum And by means of an acid the earth that it contains may be seperated in a finely divided state divided state -",
  "52": "By other analogous methods which were exhibited in the Autumnal course of Lectures the Autumnal course of Lectures on chemical analysis on chemical analysis ; may the constituent principles of other Rocks be separated from each other from each other and obtained in a form of purity of purity And by such experimental processes it is demonstrated that is demonstrated that almost the varieties of the primitive Rocks that have been described consist chiefly of different combinations of four elementary earths, called Silex alumine Lime and Magnesia Lime and Magnesia and a small quantity of Iron combined with Oxygene or pure Air or pure Air .-",
  "53": "alumine in its pure state and chrystalized form exists in the Sapphire - silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth in Rock chrystal Rock chrystal Rock chrystal - And caustic Magnesia and Lime as they are usually offered to our attention are the undecompounded substances known by chemists under these denominations.- In feld spar feld spar feld spar the silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth is combine d with small quantities of the other primitive earths and when coloured it owes its tint to the combined Oxide of Iron combined Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron - Mica principally contains silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth and aluminous earth with a little Magnesia and Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron is its colouring nature colouring nature",
  "54": "In Hornblende and shoerl Hornblende and shoerl the quantity of iron is greater iron is greater In serpentine there is a considerable proportion of Magnesia united to the other earths - But white Limestone consists of pure Lime pure Lime united to an elastic fluid elastic fluid elastic fluid called Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid or fixed air whence its effervescence when acted on by an acid and the coloured Limestone owe their tints to Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron The elementary earths elementary earths that form the constituent parts of Rocks not only differ from each other each other in their general properties but likewise in their chemical attractions chemical attractions by which they are united.-",
  "55": "And hence indications hence indications of the composition of Stone may in most cases be gained from their external properties - Thus the chrystalized stones that principaly contain alumine and Silex substances that have a very strong affinity for each other for each other are always very hard and difficult to be broken be broken And the greater their hardness the greater the proportion of alumine - The stones that contain Magnesia with alumine and Silex on the contrary are usually soft - And Magnesia has no attraction for Silex and only a slight one for alumine -",
  "56": "And limestone which is soft the softest of all the primitive Rocks contains Lime united by a weak power of combination to an elastic fluid elastic fluid elastic fluid - At this time I can only mention these objects information concerning them may be found be found in most of the elementary books of chemistry - They are connected with Geology but are not proper subjects for extensive discussion in a Geological course The powers of decomposition in the possession of chemistry are very are very extensive but those of composition are exceedingly limited exceedingly limited",
  "57": "As yet none of the arrangements of the primitive materials of the Globe have been united by human invention human invention . We recognize the laws of attraction by which they exist but we are wholly incapable of explaining the manner in which their principles combine principles combine . And this part of the enquiry concerning their essence is as yet hidden under the same veil that conceals the minute facts concerning their origin.- The primitive Rocks and mountains The primitive Rocks and mountains the structure of which has been described the structure of which has been described often occurs in chasms which extend for many hundred miles;-",
  "58": "And their Geographical position is of considerable importance in the general the general order of Natural events - The Heat of the air is derived from the agency of the rays of the Sun upon the surface of the earth and it diminishes in proportion to the height so that the Atmosphere at three or four miles high is intensely cold - Hence the temperature of mountains is always much lower than that of plains - And in all climates of the Globe when they are above 15 thousand feet",
  "59": "high their tops are covered with perpetual Snow - And the height of the point of congelation diminishes in a regular progression from the equator towards the poles towards the poles so that in our latitude it is about five thousand feet Ben Nevis Ben Nevis Ben Nevis Ben Nevis being very little within very little within the limits of constant ice - It is in consequence of this circumstance that mountain chains affect in a high degree the temperature of the climate in which they exist - In the summer currents of cold air are continually flowing down their sides their sides which mitigate the burning heat of the season",
  "60": "In winter they influence the course of the winds so as in many cases to protect the plains from their effects - In Britain for instance the principal mountains occur in the North and North East part of the Island of the Island . And our hottest winds in summer and our coldest winds in winter in winter blow from those quarters so that their situation is well adapted to diminish the heat in the one case and to break the force of the cold blast in the other case other case - North America as is well know is",
  "61": "much colder in winter and hotter in summer than the parts of Europe under the same parallels of Latitude And this seems in great measure to be owing to the inferiority of its mountains which are few in number and none of which can be compared in height to the Pyrenees or the Norwegian Alps and much less to the Alps of Switzerland Alps of Switzerland Alps of Switzerland In South America the great chain of great chain of the Andes the Andes though partly under partly under the Equator considerably tends to diminish the temperature of the climate and to render it habitable :",
  "62": "And upon And upon a smaller scale it may be said that the most fertile of the trophical islands and those the most luxuriant in vegetation in vegetation are such as present the most mountainous aspect.- The effects of Mountains upon the temperature of climates are extensive and they possess other agencies perhaps still more importa nt In consequence of their low temperature They are constantly precipitating moisture from the Air or arresting the Clouds in their progress or from the thawing of Snow upon them they are sources of springs and rivers -",
  "63": "And the streams proceeding from them which at their origin flow only over bare Rocks and water only moss or the become in their progress the cause of the fertility of the rich Valleys and produce the verdure of the cultivated plain.- Even those strata which have no elevation and which are buried beneath the Surface the Surface act in preserving the consistency of the soil and they prevent water and the matter capable of being organiz organized from penetrating to too great a depth in the earth the earth where they would be placed out of the",
  "64": "reach of plants and deprived of the influence of the Atmosphere and of light - By the irregularities in the exterior of the Earth the whole quantity of surface is considerably increased .
