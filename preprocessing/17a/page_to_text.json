I shall devote the remainder of the time allotted to this sitting to the description of some of the most important of the secondary strata and to the discussion of their general arrangement. I had an intention of entering upon the enquiry concerning their origin and the great revolution in Nature by which they were formed. -",
  "25": "but upon farther consideration I am inclined to beleive that this subject will be best examined after the general facts have been stated in detail - It is very comprehensive and important to be well understood it ought to be fully develloped and it will most properly form the subject of the next Lecture - The secondary strata differ in their arrangement and position in different countries but there is an analogy is an analogy in their composition and in their proportion",
  "26": "which demonstrates that they are in all cases congenerous cases congenerous of one family and produced by similar operations. Compact Limestone or shell marble is one of the most common of the secondary Rocks even when it is examined in the smalest masses its character appears perfectly distinct from those of primitive marble and though its composition is nearly the same its texture is wholly different. It presents either a smooth surface when broken or a fracture exhibiting a number of small plates and has",

Instance Secondary marble is of many kinds and though its principle constituent parts are uniformly Lime and Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid yet it often contains an other earthy matter particularly Magnesia particularly Magnesia The purest Limestone are those which most rapidly dissolve in acids and leave the smalest quantity of insoluble matter That Limestone that contains Magnesia contains Magnesia is very difficultly soluble.",

  "30": "Thus the shells found in the light grey and yellow strata of pure limestone are very different from those she in the Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone and the Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone containing organic substances very different from those found in Chalk Instance Most of these shells these shells and remains are in some measure to those of species at present existing but in no case I believe perfectly identical which proves either that there has been a great change in the generation of the beings that produced them.",
  "31": "In some instances some instances the form only of the organic substances remains and it is filled up with new stoney matter - In other instances other instances the yellow and glittering compound glittering compound of Sulphur and Iron and Iron called pyrites called pyrites is found to have taken the place of the original organic matter - and in some few instances the unaltered parts of the shells are found - The remains of the Nautilus exhibit this fact it retains its lusture and its beauty and its composition remains unaltered may be demonstrated by a very simple experiment -",
  "32": "Mr Hatchet has shewn has shewn that the shells of living Animals contain a gell gelatinous matter which when dissolved in water or an acid renders turbid the solution of galls - A portion of this shell has been dissolved in a little di diluted Muriatic acid Muriatic acid Muriatic acid merely sufficient to neutralize the Lime - when a solution of Galls solution of Galls solution of Galls is mixed with it a cloud will be distinct which could not have happened if the shell had merely been merely Lime and Carbonic acid Carbonic acid Carbonic acid for a solution containing an equal weight of this fossil which though fossil which though it",

Instance lumsden The Cliffs represented in this picture are nearly 300 feet high and in some places quite perpendicular their masses are large and their considerable and their outline is broken from decomposition. Sandstone is a secondary Rock very various in its texture and composition but it uniformly consists of particles of sand or gravel cemented together either by calcareous or silicious matter .",
  "38": "It is seldom very firm when calcareous it effervesces with acids and when silicious it scratches glass - Instance When pebbles are imbedded in stones of this kind they are called plumb pudden stones or breccy It is one of the substances most abundant in organic remains and often contains the impressions of entire fishes various shells and the parts of the land and of marine plants - Instance In some few instances the remains of Quadrupeds are found in this Rock .-",
  "39": "The entire skeleton of a crocodile was lately discovered in the calcareous Sandstone between Bristol and Bath. In this work published in 1726 there is an account of a skeleton found in a Sandstone Rock supposed to be a human skeleton The paper is entitled an account of the remains of a man who had witnessed the deluge but the examination of the pla te ce pla te ce will I believe induce every impartial enquirer to doubt if the bones were human. To me they seem to resemble much more the remains of a fish than of a man or at least it must be allowed that the Antediluvians if they had such skeletons",

Its basis is the same substance as charcoal but it is usually impregnated with Bitumen which is the part of the Coal that fuses and occasion coking and that emits the vapour which produces flame",

Coal generally occurs in thin layers or seams which seldom extend to any considerable depth - Its appearance in masses is too well known to need any elucidations any elucidations and it and it cannot be mistaken for any other secondary stratum - The last great class of the secondary masses that I shall notice in this lecture this lecture is Win or Basalt . or Basalt . These names are applied to very different substances ; but in their philosophical meaning they ought always to signify stones consisting principally of Hornblende and feldspar Hornblende and feldspar",

  "44": "Large masses of Basalt often occur containing no organic remains but in a few instances vegetable coal is found in it, and now and then the impressions of fishes . Basalt is distinguished from all other rocks by the variety of its aspect and by the singularity and beauty of its arrangement. It sometimes occurs in layers between the other secondary Rocks other secondary Rocks but in this case it is usually split perpendicularly so as to form distinct parts of irregular shapes - Instance",
  "45": "At other times it is arranged in columnar masses which are connected as series of regular pillars and this is the most interesting and impressive form in which it appears - the Island of Staffa on the western coast of Scotland presents one of the most magnificent views of this kind that has ever been observed in nature - The Coasts of Staffa are about three miles in circumference and all their upper parts are composed of ranges of basaltic pillars differing in their size and height but all in regular forms. regular forms.",

The Giant's Causeway Giant's Causeway Giant's Causeway Giant's Causeway on the coast of Antrim in Ireland is a basaltic arrangement almost as remarkable as that of Staffa many series of great columns occur one above the other and they are for most part articulated or composed of points. This is a print of the Giants Causeway the Giants Causeway Giants Causeway Giants Causeway It exhibits the great extent and general arrangements of the basaltic rocks which in this part of the Island form the principle Cliffs of the Coast - The Basalt of Antrim is similar in its texture and composition to that of Staffa",
