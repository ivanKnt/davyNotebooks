  "8": "And even the most sober and cool understanding is almost irresistably led to form ideas concerning the state of things existing at their origin and concerning the powerful material agents subservient to those great Natural events, the occurrences of which is demonstrated by their arrangement and wonderful appearances- The subject is one of high interest: but it ought to be pursued with considerable caution men possessing very brilliant talents have differed essentially upon it. Hypotheses",
  "9": "have been multiplied with regard to it and much ingenuity and labour have been employed upon the disscussion In accounting for the present order of things, we are enabled constantly to appeal to the to the senses to combine observation and experiment: but in attempting to explain the past change in Nature ; if we are in possession of no distinct History, analogy is our only guide. Inferences must be made from the known concerning the unknown facts. And the mind if unable to obtain certainty must rest satisfied with strong probability.-",
  "10": "None of the facts concerning the formation of the secondary rocks can be immediately Known All our reasoning upon them must be inductive. They must be founded upon the knowledge of the properties of the substances that compose the strata and of the agents by which these substances are capable of being modified And where causes can be plausibly develloped it must be from the examinati on of existing operations that produce appearances similar to those which are the objects of enquiry",
  "11": "Amongst the secondary Rocks, limestone is that which occupies the most important place: and it is the stratified substance stratified substance perhaps the most interesting in its relations to general theory. - All Shell Limestone All Shell Limestone Shell Limestone Shell Limestone when minutely examined exhibit a texture which proves that their constituent parts at the time they were deposited upon the organic remains were in a state of liquidity or liquidity or solution - This inference it is not possible to This inference it is not possible to doubt the interior doubt the interior",
  "12": "This inference it is not possible to doubt to doubt - The interior of the shells in marble are almost always filled with chrystals with chrystals likewise abound in various parts of the these stones as their formation must have been subsequent to that of the organic bodies they include and it implies a previous state of chemical division chemical division - This a principle fact admitted in all the Theories of Geology, but explained in different manners - The only two Agents which act upon a great scale in Nature in producing",
  "13": "fluidity or solution are Fire and Water and these being the only powers which could have operated in the production of the secondary strata at least to known to us are the only powers concerning the agencies of which we have a right to conjecture. - It has long been known that limestone carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime is soluble is soluble to a small extent in water. Almost all our common pumps and river water contain it and it is more soluble in water impregnated with Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid or f fixed Air than in pure water .",
  "14": "It has likewise been shown by some late experiments that this substance is capable of being fused by Heat. When Limestone is ignited in our fires the Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid which forms almost half of its weight flies off and the pure Lime is wholly infusible. But when Limestone Heated strongly in close vessels from which the elastic fluid elastic fluid elastic fluid cannot escape the compound is readily softened and becomes fluid at a white heat This is a beautiful discovery of Sir James Hall Sir James Hall Sir James Hall , I have had the pleasure of examining his specimens and of witnessing his",
  "15": "method and I have seen pieces of compact stone even containing chrystals which had been formed by heat under pressure from coarsely powdered from coarsely powdered chalk. - As both the great Agents great Agents of Nature are capable of rendering the constituent parts of carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime fluid we must be guided by the appearances in endeavouring to decide which was most probably concerned in the production of the secondary limestone - The shells contained in Limestone preserve their perfect forms and some have their texture unaltered. -",
  "16": "Now it is difficult to conceive that this could have happened if they had been surrounded by melted matter for they must themselves have been brought into fusion and consequently ought to be found of the same texture and compactness as the stone in which they are imbedded or at least they ought to have been in some measure altered in their form or composition.- The greater number of shell Limestone are disposed in alternate layers; and these have every",
  "17": "appearance of being produced by a deposition from water and the effect is very little compatable with the idea of igneous fusion igneous fusion of the materials of the strata.- The strongest argument that has been produced for the agency of fire agency of fire is derived from the fact of the curvature of some of the calcareous strata This it has been said almost proves that they were in a soft state soft state and that they were elevated at the time of their formation by some force acting from beneath -",
  "18": "Instance These are the sketches of the arched strata arched strata you saw them in the former lecture To me they seem unconnected with any effect of heat and they may easily be accounted for by supposing by supposing an arched form in the surface upon which the first layer was deposited There are analogous instances analogous instances which occur every day. This is a piece of carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime having all the properties of Limestone which was formed in the boiler of a steam a steam engine supplied with the water of the Thames -",
  "19": "When magnified it appears wholly composed of curved layers - And this sketch represents a section of it enlarged about five hundred times - The same general conclusions may be applied with regard to calcareous sand calcareous sand stone : which consists of particles that had not been in solution not been in solution cemented by carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime which had been in solution so as to assume a chrystaline form- On the subject of silicious sandstone a new order of facts must be brought forward.-",
  "20": "The constituent parts of this substance are infusible by any heat that has been as yet applied in our artificial processes; But silicious sand is soluble under certain circumstances . - Thus the boiling water which spouts from the Giezer in Iceland was found by Dr Black Dr Black Dr Black impregnated with silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth And silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth appears to be capable of being dissolved by the fluids of plants for I have detected it deposited in consider able quantities in the interior of various Grasses and in the rattan in the rattan -",
  "21": "And M r Macie M r Macie M r Macie found large nodules of silicious concretions within the points of the Bamboo. - That silicious Sandstone cannot owe its compactness or its chrystalized texture to the agency of fire even allowing it capable of being fused is I think evident from many appearances - Thus there are often found embeded in silicious sandstones silicious sandstones fragments of very fusible rocks not apparently altered & nor rounded in their forms this I have seen in several Instances;",
  "22": "I particularly recolect one in a quarry near Edinburgh near Edinburgh in which pieces of win of very different shapes occured in the rock and win is fusible at a heat which would scarcely affect the Sandstone . the Sandstone . As silicious Sandstone is found both above and below shell limestone it is scarcely possible to doubt but that some of the same causes must have operated in the production of both these classes of stones",
  "23": "And consequently the only probable agent to which we can refer the solution of the silicious matter is water either heated or under some peculiar circumstances of combination - The different species of shistous Rocks present no chrystalized texture, and some of them are capable of being fused and most of them are hardened by fire. Instance There is consequently very little reason to suppose that this agent was concerned in their production their production . And their origin may with a much higher degree of probability be referred",
  "24": "to a deposition of minute solid particles minute solid particles of argillaceous and silicious matter which had been mechanically suspended in water and of which the present adhesion is owing to Bitumenous matter or Oxide of Iron matter or Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Oxide of Iron Chalk which consists of particles of carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime merely in a state of mechanical adhesion must as there is every reason to believe beleive like Shist have been produced by the deposition of solid matter solid matter finely divided and suspended in a fluid suspended in a fluid -",
  "25": "With regard to the strata of Flint which generally alternate with chalk it is very difficult to assign any satisfactory cause for their formation their formation - That they could not have been produced by fusion is evident for if their constituent parts are at all capable of being rendered liquid by Heat it can only be by a degree much more intense than we are able to produce; and such a heat acting under pressure must have necessarily have likewise fused The calcareous matter surrounding them It very often happens that perfect impressions of the Echinces are found filled with Flint whilst the exterior is chrystalize d carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime",
  "26": "Instance Now it is scarcely possible to conceive that this could have taken place unless the silicious matter had been carried through the orifices of the shell and deposited in the cavity by a fluid and gradually acting menstruum - On the subject of the origin of Coal there have been various opinions various opinions But the vegetable and animal impressions that it contains as I mentioned in the last lecture ought to lead us without much minute discussion to the theory of its production -",
  "27": "Where wood has been buried in the Earth in late times |_ from the action of water and of air it always undergoes a change which brings it to a state similar to that of Pit Coal - At Bovey in Devonshire At Bovey in Devonshire a whole forest is found buried under different strata of clay and gravel and the trees though Carbonaceous and black have their ligneous form and contain a substance apparently intermediate between Bitumen and resin as has been shewn by M r Hatchet M r Hatchet M r Hatchet M r Hatchet",
  "28": "A similar species of Coal is found in Sussex and in Iceland where it is named Surtabrand and the pieces appear flattened probably from the pressure of the superincumbent mass during the time of the conversion of the wood into Coaly matter Coaly matter _| Vegetable and animal substance may however likewise be converted into a body resembling Pit Coal by Heat under pressure Sir James Hall Sir James Hall Sir James Hall has shewn This making use of the same means as those employed in his experiments upon limestone -",
  "29": "He has proved that by a strong heat applied to different animal matter and different species of wood in close vessels a substance is produced black and glossy and having properties different from those of common charcoal as it burns with a dense flame giving out volatile matter - Sir James has adduced his experiments as proof of the Huttonian Theory Huttonian Theory Huttonian Theory of the igneous origin of pit coal; his arguments are in the highest degree ingenious and if the insulated facts only were to be considered very forcible and convincing .-",
  "30": "But when the usual strata above and below coal are examined it is scarcely possible for the impartial observer to suppose that they had been subjected to heat to heat - They are principally loose Sandstone and loose Shist bearing every mark of having been deposited from a state of mechanical suspension in water suspension in water - Instance The agency of water and the natural process of decomposition to which all organized matter is liable this seems fully adequate to explain the appearances",
  "31": "of the coal strata. - |_ Vegetable matter in its first state of fermentation appears as heat appears as heat - In another and more advanced state it is the same substance as Bovey coal Bovey coal Bovey coal - and when the Bitumen is completely formed it is the true fossil the true fossil coal in which the ligneous texture is sometimes evident and sometimes destroyed - In a Quarry near Glasgow vegetable matter is found in almost all its different states of conversion - Near the surface it is but little decomposed and here it occurs in a very imperfect Sandstone apparently of late formation",
  "32": "In a lower stratum about ten feet below it has the appearance of wood slightly charred; and in the compact and white Sandstone which is used for building it occurs apparently converted into Bituminous Coal -_| Instance The last subject of particular theory which it will be necessary to discuss is perhaps the most difficult and the most connected with the operation of unknown powers. I mean the formation of basaltic Rocks basaltic Rocks . -",
  "33": "For a long while all Basalt was considered as a volcanic production; but since it has been found alternating with other rocks deposited in regular layers this generalization has been given up by a number of Philosophers and a more limited Theory adopted Basalt as was shewn in the course of the last lecture to be a chrystalized substance consisting of Hornblende and feld spar- Its elements are not soluble in common water but they are capable of being rendered fluid by Heat though after fusion they have never yet been",
  "34": "made to assume their original form - It is not possible therefore to account for the origin of the Rock satisfactorily from any certainly known facts .- And we must be contented with presumtive contented with presumtive evidence from the evidence from the particular appearances which it presents and the it presents and the circumstances under which it is found it is found - All the basaltic Rocks of great extent as yet examined yet examined have been discovered upon common secondary Rocks containing organic remains - And these layers of Basalt extending over many square miles often occur between",
  "35": "strata of Shist and of Sandstone Shist and of Sandstone of the common kind and having nothing peculiar in their aspect. - The same basaltic strata which occur in Teesdale and which are represented in this sketch extend into the north into Alstone more: and they have been traced more than thirty miles and they are uniform a ly found between the same shistous strata; and the Shist below them and incumbent upon them contains organic remains and is exceedingly soft though when acted upon by a Heat much below that necessary for fusing Basalt it becomes very hard Instance hard Instance",
  "36": "and at the white Heat it is itself capable of being rendered fluid. Instance So that it is impossible to suppose that this basaltic stratum was ever in igneous fusion - The same reasoning may be applied in accounting for the arrangement in the other layers of basaltic Rocks basaltic Rocks found in the same district. I have examined three of the lower strata and to me they have uniform a ly appeared to exhibit analagous facts. -",
  "37": "In the western Islands of Scotland and in the coast of Antrim all the great and Majestic arrangements of Basalt are uniformly incumbent upon Rocks which exhibit no marks of the agency of fire - At the Giants Causeway Giants Causeway Giants Causeway the Baslat the Basalt the Basalt is said to alternate with sandstone and at Staffa as appears from the sketch and as I mentioned in the last lecture it is placed upon a Breccia which contains, immediately below the pillars fragments of a stone equally fusible with Basalt -",
  "38": "Instance The basaltic Rocks in the neighbourhood of neighbourhood of Edinburgh are all almost fixed upon sand stone Schist or Limestone stone Schist or Limestone : but their arrangement is much more disturbed than in most other cases - In the basaltic mountains called Arthurs Seat several layers several layers of irregularly disposed columnar basalt columnar basalt columnar basalt are formed Alternating with sandstone . And at the point of junction the sandstone is of a different texture considerably harder and of a red colour. - This fact was adduced by D r Hutton D r Hutton D r Hutton as a demonstration of the igneous",
  "39": "origin of Basalt He supposed that the materials of it being projected in a fluid state amongst the strata of sandstone had hardened them at the point of contact point of contact and given them a new texture I have paid particular attention to this appearance I exhibited a specimen of the junction of the Basalt and Sandstone in the last lecture - This is a piece of the general layer of Sandstone layer of Sandstone in its softest state I have exposed a part of this layer to a Heat sufficient to fuse Basalt : but I do not find that it in any considerable degree considerable degree -",
  "40": "And in examining the hard mass in contact with the Basalt and in comparing it with the soft mass below it I find that their difference does not depend upon a different consolidation of the same matter; but upon a real difference of compaction of compaction for the hard substance contains much more silicious matter than the soft one Some of the pillars of the Great basaltic Arrangments often occur in a bent form and curved and this has been brought forward as an argument for their having been fluid. but the",
  "41": "same explanation may be given of this phaenomena of the curvature of strata The columnar forms generally speaking indeed offers no evidences in favour of the igneous fusion. It is said that some of the lavas of Etna where they have flowed into the sea are found in the state of pillars but these are rare instances; Similar effects takes place much more commonly during the drying of masses which have been consolidated by the agency of water - Thus the common form of starch is produced at the time of its drying and if pure Clay be made and spread upon a",
  "42": "large surface it always splits at the time of the evaporation of the moisture into pieces into pieces many of which have regular forms - All the facts seem to render it probable that the basaltic rocks usually found in alternation with the common secondary Rocks cannot be of igneous origin; But the proposition of the of the improbability of the formation of this substance by fire must not be advanced ; - In many secondary and primitive countries veins or dikes of Basalt are found are found which have many characters",
  "43": "similar to those of lava and which often appear to have produced similar effects - At Cockfield in Durham the coal strata are intersected by a vein of Basalt and where this substance comes in contact with the inflamable matter its effects are precisely similar to those which would be produced by fire - The Bitumen of the Coal is driven off and the coal appears as coke In Northumberland and in Derbyshire there are analogous instances . -",
  "44": "Instance I have had but few opportunities of examining the kind of Basalt which fills these dikes these dikes these dikes these dikes but in the specimens that I have seen it has appeared of a much finer grain than the common Basalt and approaching nearer in its nature to lava Instance I have already mentioned that Basalt may be fused and after fusion may be made to Chrystalize by slow cooling though its constituent parts do not seperate into the distinct forms of Hornblende and feldspar whether the chrystals are ever seperately perfectly distinct in the basaltic dikes in the basaltic dikes I am not able to decide",
  "45": "Sir Ja s Hall Sir Ja s Hall Sir Ja s Hall Ja s Hall by preserving Basalt in a state of imperfect fluidity for a considerable time at last procured a body exceedingly analogous in its general appearance to the original stone. - His experiments were repeated upon a much larger scale mass of the same substance by M r Gregory Watt M r Gregory Watt M r Gregory Watt Gregory Watt Gregory Watt - There is in this drawer a series of the specimens produced in different states of graduation from a more opaque glass to an assemblage of Uniform Chrystals. - M r Watts M r Watts M r Watts paper may be found in the last volume of the philosophical Transactions philosophical Transactions philosophical Transactions",
  "46": "and it is filled with curious reasoning and with useful information - It was the first and the last production of an early matured genius early matured genius who had devoted himself to Geology who and who had given the strongest promise of promoting its most important objects - M r Watt M r Watt M r Watt had examined a number of the most perfectly formed volcanic specimens with great attention - He had accurately compared them with the stratafied Basalt and He was fully of opinion that substances very nearly alike might be formed both by aqueous deposition and by aqueous fusion -",
  "47": "He had himself no particular Hypotheses and He had opposed the different to each other with great fairness and caution and He was preparing a series of experiments to elucidate the general History, unfortunately He did not live to execute his designs, - and those only whe were intimately acquainted with the extent of his Knowledge the quickness of his perception and teh accuracy of His judgement those only can estimate the serious loss that science has sustained by his recent death recent death I have now stated and I hope without any prejudice of system those opinions",
  "48": "belonging to the different Theories which offer the most plausible explanation of the causes that appear to have operated in producing and consolidating the particular secondary strata .- Concerning their general arrangements and the revolutions in nature connected with it I have as yet offered no supposition but this part of the subject necessarily follows in the order of discussion. - All the appearances all the different facts shew facts shew in the most decided manner",
  "49": "That the various strata That the various strata filled with organic remains were covered by the sea at the time of their production their production This is the ancient Theory which will not be not be disputed though many modifications of it may be formed: it may be formed: And various arguments must be stated before it can be decided whether the strata were formed by slow operations or by rapid changes whether they were the works of days or of ages and whether the present land was anciently the bed of the Ocean or whether the secondary rocks were formed upon it by a great influx of waters.-",
  "50": "M r de Luc M r de Luc M r de Luc a part of whose theory I noticed in a former lecture in a former lecture in his last publication the letters to Blumenback attempts to shew that the secondary Rocks were all produced long before the before the creation of Man .- He conceives He conceives that the original Ocean held in solution all the matters that compose them; And that these matters were deposited and consolidated at the time that the waters were peopled with marine plants and animals plants and animals .-",
  "51": "Reasoning upon the sucessive depositions of strata He supposed that an immense length of time must have been essential to their formation and He believes that the six days in Genesis mean periods almost indefinitely great indefinitely great It is with regret that I was obliged again obliged to express an opinion very different from that of this venerable philosopher But in appealing to the most simple and obvious analogies only his Hypothesis seems incapable of being reconciled to the appearances. -",
  "52": "Supposing that the ocean had held in solution the different substances different substances which form the secondary strata. On M r De Lucs Theory there is no cause for their precipitation no new agent is supposed to be introduced and as the same bodies uniformly preserve the same attraction for each other: The series of events that He has assumed are contradictory to the established chemical laws Besides supposing a fluid saturated with silicious matter with the other earths and with the metals it is scarcely possible to conceive that it was fitted for the purpose of life of life !",
  "53": "or that it could have been the abode of Marine Animals at the time the great changes of composition which M r DeLic de Luc de Luc de Luc imagines were Taking place in it The existance of Coal strata of vegetable and animal origin and animal origin alternating with the other secondary Rocks seems almost decidedly to shew that their formation took place upon a surface which had before been habitable land habitable land . For the Idea of Buffon that the carbonaceous matter might have been washed down by rivers and burried in the bottom of the sea will not coincide with certain simple facts.-",
  "54": "In the Coal and in the strata above and below Coal are found perfect impressions of the thinnest and most delicate vegetable leaves and such substances so easy of decomposition if derived from the land by rivers by rivers must necessarily have been destroyed by the action of Air and water long before long before they could have reached the depth of the ocean of the ocean - There are no distinct appearances which demonstrate a very slow and gradual deposition of the secondary strata ; but there are many which shew that at least in some cases the effect of their",
  "55": "formation must have been sudden and rapid - Fishes the organized matter of which so easily consumes have left their impressions embedded in the hardest Rocks . and these impressions often exhibit the perfect and unaltered form - Instance Other marine Animals likewise of a still more delicate organization exhibit vestages of their remains on undecomposed structure Instance The various appearances would seem to indicate that these different beings had been suddenly destroyed and suddenly enclosed in the strata that contain them. --",
  "56": "The various remains of the land animals found in Sand stone Sand stone Sand stone Sand stone alternating with Shell Limestone Shell Limestone Shell Limestone Shell Limestone offers another indication of the waters having covered the place of their abode .- And that these waters flowed in upon a great extent of country and rushed over the surface with considerable force considerable force seems evident seems evident from the transportation of the remains of the Animals which are which are now only now only found within the tropics, within the tropics, toward the poles - The bones of the Rhinoceros and of the Elephant have been found in",
  "57": "Siberia The tusks of the Elephant have often been discovered in this country I mentioned in the last lecture the bones of the Crocodile found at Bath at Bath I have since been so fortunate as to procure a drawing of them made by M r Rickharts from the kindness of Sir Ge o Paull. Sir Ge o Paull. Sir Ge o Paull.
