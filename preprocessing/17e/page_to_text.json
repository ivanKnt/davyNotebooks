It is certain that no part of the Island can vie with the borders of Etna in verdure in herbage and in the luxuriance of the Grain. The ground is agreeably diversified by the number of small hills which at different periods have formed an out let for the subterranean fires but wwhich in the long process of time have become covered with vegetable mould and by their present abundance atone for their ancient sterility Trees so scarce in other parts of the Island spring up here spontaneously and attain a strength and vigour scarcely to be seen elsewhere - Amongst them peep on number of small country Houses and villages the inhabitants of which are well formed and healthy Almost sinking under the heat of - the freshness of the air which we here experienced seemed a blessing sent from heaven and every object that we beheld appeared warmed with beauty and filled with life - The summits of Volcanic mountains when elevated to any considerable height or after having felt the effects of an eruption present a striking contrast when examined in the same vie w with the lower regions - Black and rugged and barren if not covered with snow they bear the evidence of having been changed by the force of fire - Formed of lava and strewed over with Pumice stone or with volcanic dust and sand they present pictures of which all the features are wild and sublime and more impressive as the necessarily call up in the mind the imagination of the great natural events by which they were formed. - Most of the Craters or interior cones of the great Volcanic mountains in their common states emit smoke or some kind of vapour and the lava of which they are composed is very irregular in its forms and various in its constitution - Breslac thus describes the crater of Vesuvius as it appeared in 1800 The cone He says is cut in an inclined frame having its direction from North East to south west - The circumference of the Crater is about 3000 feet - All the bottom is a considerable plain from which vapours of different degrees of density almost constantly issue and the sides of it offer the remains of the last lava that issued from it in the eruption of 1754 Instance D r Van Troil mentions very similar facts with regard to the different Craters of Hecla in Iceland which having their exterior covered with snow constantly emit from their interior vapours insupportably hot and exhibit walls of lava having the appearance of black Glass - The Friend who I have before quoted spent some hours upon the summit of Etna in the summer of 1803 I have transcribed his descreption of this journey to the edge of the great Crater, Large tracts of snow He says lead to the foot of it the ascent is prodigiously steep and rendered the more difficult by the immense blocks of lava on which you are constantly obliged tread and which never afford a secure footing. We soon reached the spot whence issued the late eruption only about two months ago the aperture is very small - Sulphureous steams issue from it in great quantities and large masses of Sulphur appear in its neighborhood - The ashes sand, Scoria , and lava of which the external past of the Crater is composed have no consistence - Hence you slip at every step but in slipping you make a footing. We had occasion to repose several times but by degrees we attained the summit. - The present Crater has been formed within the last century chiefly by eight great eruptions Its height according to Ferrara is 1800 feet the circumference of its Case 1200 feet The vew view which presented it self from the top of the Crater was perfectly new altogether different from what I had expected - As you have no object with which to compare the hollow you can form no accurate judgment by the eye of any of its dimensions. - The ground of the border is so hot as to burn the feet vapours issue from numerous orifices in it - And from the huge abyss itself arise volumes of thick smoke which darken the face of heaven and the colour of which is constantly varying - The sun seen through this smoke sometimes appears perfectly white and sometimes of a blood red colour, we looked with long and anxious expectancy for a favoured moment in which the currents of vapour might dispappear or become less dense so as to exhibit to us the interior of this wonderful Laboratory of Nature : but looked in vain We rolled down large stones with the hopes of being able to estimate the depth from the time of their descent. The ground shook under us as often as they struck against the side of the precipice and the sounds became fainter and more indistinct till they were gradually lost: but we had no reason to suppose that we heard the noise of their last fall. - Instance Spalanzoni as He himself relates was more fortunate as to the circumstances under which He beheld the Crater in Sep r 1788 - and unless He was much decieved He saw the very lowest part of the aperture I sat down says this Author near the edge of the Crater and remained there two hours I viewed with astonishment the configuration of the border the internal sides the form of the immense cavern. its bottom an aperture which appeared like the melted matter which boiled within and the smoke that ascended from it the whole of this stupendous was distinctly displayed before me; and I shall now proceed to give some descrepcion of it though it will only be possible to give present the read er with a very feeble image of a most grand and astonishing sight The upper edges of the Crater are about a mile and half in circumference - the sides are composed of rugged pieces of lava form a speices of funnel and abound with concretions of Sal ammonia The bottom is a horizontal plane about two thirds of a mile round - In this plane a circular aperture was visible from which issued a large column of smoke and when this smoke was impelled to the side opposite to that on which I was I can affirm that I perceived very distinctly a liquid ignited matter which continually indulated and boiled and rose and fell without spreading over the bottom and this certainly was the melted lava which had risen to that aperture from the bottom of the Etnean Gulf Instance The general aspect of a Volcanic district even in its most quiet state must be highly impressive but when the subterranean fines are displayed in their full energy when they burst forth from the interior of the earth desolating and destroying then the effect must be beyond all comparison the most awful and the most sublime of the phaenomena belonging to our Globe multiplied descreptions have been given of the eruptions of volcanoes - Philosophers have detailed them poets have painted them but language must necessarily fail when applied to such a purpose: and not even the most perfect delineation of the most perfect artist could do justice to a combination of circumstances in which feeling and hearing and sight are almost equally concerned. In which the Earth trembles - In which the continued sound of thunder dwells upon the ear, and in which the eye is constantly dazzled by lightening flashing above and by liquid fire streaming below - From the most accurate account it appears That before any great eruption takes place the mountain for a considerable time is more than usually tranquil and one of the most common indication of the approach of the event is a great stillness in the air slight tremblings of the earth and a drying up of the streams in the vicinity A voilent earthquake often accompanies the first great appearance of smoke and flame and the mountain is often in combustion for many days before any lava appears At other times however in cases when great explosions have taken place, the lava is thrown out at the same time with the smoke and flame: and this happened in the eruption of Vesuvius in 1794 one of the greatest recorded. The general progress and extensive evern effects of this event were minutely observed and have been accurately detailed by Sir W m Hamilton - And I trust that an abstract of a few of the most remarkable particularr taken from his paper published in the Ph s : Tran: for 1794 will not be found tedious They immediately belong to the subject of the lecture and will offer some curious elucidations of Theory. - The mountain says the illustrious Auther observer had been remarkably quiet for seven months nor did the usual smoke issue from the Crater; but at times it emitted clouds that floated in the air in the shape of little Trees - It was remarked that for some days preceeding the eruption a thick vapour was seen to surround the mountain about a quarter of a mile beneath its crater and the sun and moon had an unusual reddish colour cast. - The water of the great fountain and of the other to in the vicinity of Torre del Greco began to decrease The water at the great fountain of Torre del Greco and of the other springs in the vicinity began to decrease some days before the eruption. - On the 12 of June there was a violent fall of rain and soon after the inhabitants of Reseria situated directly over the ancient Town of Herculaneum were sensible of a rumbling subterraneous noise - and about 11 oClock at night a voilent shock of an earthquake was felt at Naples . On the fifteenth of June soon after 10 oClock at night an other shock occured: but not so voilent as that of the 12th. And at the same moment a fountain of bright fire attended with a very black smoke and a loud repost was seen to issue and rise to a great height from about the middle of the Cone of Vesuvius and soon after another of the same kind broke out at a little distance lower down and both the openings immediately poured forth lava - Fresh fountains of liquid fire succeeded each other hastily and in the space of a mile and half fifteen of them might be numbered, and others most probably were hidden by the smoke. It is impossible that any description can give an idea of this firy scene or of the horid horrid noises that attended this great operation of nature - It was a mixture of the loudest thunder with incessant reports like these from a numerous heavy artillery and accompanied by a continual hollow murmur like that of the rearing of the ocean during a voilent storm - There was an intermission at about 2 in the morning of the 16. but at 4 the Crater again shewed signs of a new action - And lava issued from a new opening on the other side of the mountain facing xxxxx Ottaiano and in a short time had passed over three miles of Ground and overwhelmed and burnt a considerable Wood - The upper part of Vesuvius was again soon involved in clouds and darkness: and so it remained for several days. but above these clouds fresh columns of smoke were continually rising till the whole mass had the form of a fine tree stretching to an enormous height in the Atmosphere and in that gigantic mass of heavy clouds flashes of forked lightning were constantly observed, so bright as to be visible in the day time. -At about six oClock in the morning of the 16 th the lava had reached the sea after having passed through and destroy d the greatest part of Torre del Greco It meet the waves with a hissing noise and with loud explosions and continued and some time to flow beneath them. Instance Some of the eruptions of Etna have been upon a scale still greater than even this of Vesuvius In the eruption of 1669 the effects were the most tremendous that have been noticed in any age on or in any country. These effects have been minutely described in a letter from Lord whin Lord Winchelsea to Charles the Second - His Lordship was an eye witness of the event and has related it with much strength of coloring and liveliness of description which even the quaintness of and ambiguity of his stile cannot obscure - I shall make no apology for extracting a few sentences from the Work - I accepted (says the Auther) the invitation of the Bishop of Catania to stay a day with him so that I might be the better able to inform your Majesty of the extraordinary fire which comes from Mount Etna 15 miles distant from that City, which from the horridness of its aspect for the vast quantity thereof (for it is 15 miles in length and 7 in breadth) for its monstrous devastation and quick progress may be terme an inundation of fire a flood of fire and glowing stones burning with such rage as to advance into the sea 600 yards and that to a mile in breadth which I saw - And that which did agu augment my admiration was to see in the sea this matter like rugged rocks burning in four fathoms of water and two fathoms higher than the waves - Some parts liquid throwing off the stones about them and causing a great and horrible noise in the water and other parts becoming solid making a firm foundation - When it was night I went upon the Tower and I could plainly see at ten miles distance the fire descending from the mountain in a direct line; and the flame ascending as high as the greatest steeple in your Majestys Kingdom and throwing great stones into the air - And I could discern the rivers of fire flowing down from the mountain of a bright red colour bearing upon it great stones of a paler red - I assure your Majesty no pen can express how terrible it was nor could all the Art or industry in the world have quenched it or diverted its course. In forty days time it had destroyed the habitations of 27.000 persons made two hills of a thousand paces high each of 20 000 persons that did inhabit Catania 3000 only did remain - The fire in its progress towards Catania The fire in its progress, towards Catania meet with a lake of 4 miles in compass and it was not satisfied by filling it up though it was four fathoms deep but it has made a mountain of it All the accounts that have been published of eruptions in other parts of the world agree in their general features, and from the similarity of the ir effects of Volcanic fires a strong conclusion may be formed concerning the similarity of their causes. - On this subject however a number of difficulties oppose themselves to our reasoning The agents concerned in those great suberraneous changes are hidden deep in the bosom of the Earth and it is impossible for us to contemplate them in their active state. Even their effects can only be considered at a distance and from the grandeur and awful nature of those effects it is ccarcely possible even for the most philosophical and couragious mind to examine with coolness and precision Here analogy must be our principle guide. Analogy investigated with caution and assisted by accurate experiment - Many enquirers into nature in attempting to account for volcanoes have supposed that a permanent central fire occupying the interior of the Earth is the universal cause of igneous eruptions - This notion is one which it requires little depth of research to adopt and but little acuteness of understanding fully to refute. Heat in all its states is capable of being communicated from body to body. And if a permanent fire had been acting for ages upon the interior of the crust of the Globe its effects must long ago have been perceived upon the whole of that surface which would have exhibited not a few evident widely scattered Volcanoes but one ignited and glowing mass - An opinion infinitely more probable is that Volcanic fires are the result of chemical changes of the intimate agencies of Bodies of inflamable matters producing voilent fermentations within the solid strata |_ Lemery in 1670 was the first person who brought forward this Theory und er any precise form and He founded it upon an experiment of his own invention He buried two parts of wetted Sulphur and one of Iron beneath the ground and a few hours they fermented heated and flame arose from the surface with slight explosions - Sulphur Lemery knew was of the common products of all Volcanoes and He knew that Iron abounded in the materials thrown out by them - His hypothesis was immediately pursued and these two agents appeared to him adequate for the explanation of the effects - He had not himself been a traveller into Volcanic countries and in his time all the observations made were superficial , transient and inadequate It is not the defect of his genius therefore if his theory be insufficient to explain the phaenomena it is the defect of the knowledge of his Age. - The late researches in experimental Science have shewn that Iron cannot be combined with Sulphur in the state in which it is commonly found in metallic veins or in mines or in Volcanic Countries and therefore no distinct conclusion can be formed from the artificial process on the paste of Iron and Sulphur with regard to the real cause of subterraneous fires _|_| Since the progress of the great discoveries in pneaumatic pneumatic chemistry many have been formed having for their foundation the original principal of the depesidance of Volcanic effects upon chemical action but few of them have been produced by enlightened experimentalist - The most sagacious of the Chemists of Europe hitherto have attended more to Art than to Nature. of the great changes produced in their experiments they have principally directed their researches to minute processes for chang changing the forms of matter and for supplying the various substances belonging to the Earth to the uses and comforts of man and occupied with those truly interesting objects they have as yet attended to the natural operations of the Globe and to the changes that took place above and below the surface - These departments of the science however offer whenever they shall be cultivated with ardour rich harvests of discovery: and even in the present infant state of the enquiry the few truths that have been ascertained with regard to them have principally resulted from Chemical investigation. The chief materials active in Volcanic eruptions must be newly combined during the time of their operation and such of them as are thrown out from the mountain altered by the agency of the Air - We can however reason only upon those substances that are actually discovered and though the facts known with regard to them are scanty yet they the will afford us very good foundations for theoretical discussion. The only known substance found in the bosom of our mountain which is capable of spontaneous inflamation from the effect of common Natural agents is pyrites And this body is one of the most generally diffused in nature. It is found in almost all rocks it forms veins and often occurs in considerable masses. Now the mere agency of water is sufficient to produce such a fermentation in loose masses of pyrites as to occasion their ignition of this truth there are numerous instances I will take one recorded by D r Platt in the history of Harffordshire - A Man called wilson says the Auther who lived at Ealand in Yorkshire having piled up many cart loads of pyrites in a Barn of his own for some secret purpose perhaps to extract the Gold - The roof being faulty and admitting rain water to fall copiously in amongst them they first began to smoke and at last to take fire and burn like red hot coals so that the Town was considerably disturbed and alarmed. During the fermentation of pyrites with water Sulphur is evolved and the same species of inflamable air which is given out from in the steams of Volcanoes. but there are other products of eruption which cannot be generated merely from such a caue cause - The only operation by fire which can take place in a large scale and in which Sal Ammoniac and Bitumen and fixed Air or Carbonic Acid all of which are common Volcanic products can be evolved is in the distillation - To those persons who have not been accustomed to consider the general series of chemical phaenomena this idea may seem to need experimental proof. It would be easy to offer many but I shall content my self with one Included in the top of this model there is a mixture of pyrites and coal with a little Oxymuriate of Potash a substance that will speedily supply to the pyrite Oxygene the principle necessary to its inflamation which water would only supply slowly when I touch the mixture with a little Sulphuric acid it will heat crackle and emit smoke - This must not be considered as an imitation of a volcanic fire for then it would be ridiculous, but as an illustration of the concealed active power of matter and I shall have occasion to offer more illustrations of the same kind in the next Lecture. And if we can concieve that the principle agents in the exicitation and preservation of Volcanic fires are pyrites and pit coal acted on by water and Air all the appearances would admit of an easy explanation. - // Sir Wm Hamilton has often remarked that in common seasons Vesuvius throws out most smoke and ashes when the tides are high and the wind blowing towards the shore which seems to imply some subterraneous communication between the interior of the Volanic crater and the sea - The drying up of rivers and springs likewise before great eruptions seem to affords another indicate that the water has some fact in favor of this agency share in the effect. Their Now assuming that immense masses of pyrites existed in Volcanic mountains diffused through beds of coal and in contact with Limestone Basalt and other rocks and supposing that they were acted on by water flowing in upon them from some new orifice evidentally made the first effect would be a production of heat and this head not being carried off by any current Air would constantly accumulate and increase the general series of changes - The elastic fluid evolved becoming of a high timperature would in consequence of its expansive power make strong efforts to escape by acting upon the incumbent strata and would produce trembling and agitations in the surface - In cases in which a crater already existed it would be discharged throw it in great explosions and would carry with it aqueous vapour and bituminous and sulphureous smoke. As the elastic fluid would be unequally discharged common air would be occasionally pressed in to supply its place. and a current would be established capable of inflaming the combustible matters even in the most profound parts of the mountain with this effect the phaenomena of ignition would begin The Sulphur coal and Bitumen in combustion would tend to fuse the compound stones in contact with them - carbonic acid gas would be produced and this and the other elastic vapours would necessarily tend to elevate portions of the melted mass into the upper part of the crater. The column of ascending smoke would in consequence be inflamed the lava would be poured forth and ignited stones projected into the Air - With every chemical change their is likewise a change in the states of electricity of bodies - And where such a series of Alterations were produced the electrified Vapours would necessarily give off their fluid to the surrounding conducting surfaces and the awful phaenomena of the ignited exploded matter would be rendered more sublime by lightnings and thunders - // I venture to give this theory as an imperfect sketch at present there is no time for a full discussion of it. on next Thursday I shall resume the subject and till that period I shall likewise defer the consideration of the general effects of Earthquakes and volcanoes in the order of nature. I already anticipate a number of objections to the theory: but before it can be fairly judged of the minuter facts belonging to it ought to be considered - At the first view it will perhaps appear too complex - Accustomed constantly to look for simplicity in Nature the mind can scarcely bring it self to believe that one great Phaenomena can be produced by a combination of minute causes Yet this as will be shewn often happens in the common and general series of Natural events. - Powers that having been operating silently and unperceived for ages sometimes produce their ultimate effects in moments the most diversified of the properties of bodies are often called into activity for one end And though the Laws that govern the material world are few and simple the agency that they direct are many and complicated and as various as the ir external appearances they Produce - [blank page] with a part of a system highly -. the -. restoration of the neutral power is accompanied with / takes place through the air; and & a spark accompanied by a snap is the result. - If the contact is made & in xxxxx the best torricellian vacuum , there is no spark, no striking distance; but the if the surfaces are small there is a violent ignition -. - In air the discharge takes place through a considerable distance & this probably depends upon the mobility of its parts; - those which are negative attracting those that are positive & producing the equilibrium - possibly producing Heat & light during the production of the equilibrium. - caused to approach them in the air; & if one cylinder be brought separated from the other, that being positive the air always in contact with it will be negative: and it is probable that in the air there are attractions of negative & positive; - for if a conductor be brought into the neighborhood of a conducter system near that part electrified + it will have its part opposite + -. its middle part will be 0. & its extreme part +. - This is usually called Electricity by induction - but it may be merely a communication of the electricities of air; & their exhibition - . When any part of a system strongly plus is brought in contact near that they are perfectly capable of balancing each other & of producing a neutral state - And if in a system the part that is positive be removed from the part that is negative - It immediately produces a corresponding negative state in Ionic contiguous system. or it becomes positive & negative in its own parts. - Description of an electrical machine before - Thus if one conducter be joined to another & they are both connected with an acting cylinder of glass so as to be +. - the air in contact will be - which will be shown by bodies being attracted when but in a system composed of imperfect & perfect conductors; there is a similar analogy law similar as that prevailing with respect to nonconductors, there may be in the same system many different states, Thus copper Zinc Silver Tin & water; if exchanged the Zinc & the copper be brought in contact with each other & water & Tin & silver zinc Silver be brought in contact with all the same portion of water & the Zinc & silver be connected by an another portion; there will be at least 4 different states - ie the Zinc will be + the copper +. the zinc Tin + the silver -. - In all cases in which positive & negative electricity exist; there is always such a coincidence difficult to say whether there are not always more than two states -.- When a rod of sealing wax is rubbed at one end, there is generally a positive surface just above the negative & another negative above the positive & so on .- - In the same system of perfect conductors; as far as our knowledge extends there seems to be but two states - Thus when Zinc & silver are in contact the Zinc is positive the Silver negative; & when they are separated these zinc states are rendered very obvious & then made to touch each other will give a very sensible taste .- And if they be made to connect, the nerves and muscles in any very vivacious the limb of a dead frog a frog recently dead, contractions will be produced similar to those dependant upon the powers of life. - In every system electrified by contact ; the two different states always exist & they may be considered as analogous to the two different states in magnetised bodies. - With respect to nonconductors it very often happens that; there are many alterations of the positive & negative states in the same system; & it is single contact & when separated are found the silver minus the Zinc positive . -:. One of t The most delicate in of the simple instruments for exhibiting the electricity of bodies are - The gold leaf Electrometer of Bennet . & the electrometer by torsion of Col Coulomb . - But a still more sensible test of Electrical charge is the animal function of irritability - The tongue will detect electricity which will not affect the gold leaves or the moveable balls. - Thus a piece of Tin & a piece of well burnt charcoal - When separately brought in contact with the toungue - some of the infammable compounds containing earths & alkalies. - [sketch of face in profile] The electicities of nonconduuctors can be easily exhibited because by successive contacts ie friction all their parts may be extensively made to touch each - & their electricity effect will be permanent; but in conducting bodies ; where the influence is rapidly comunicated to all the parts; - successive contacts are not so efficatious. & in general the full effe power is exhibited by a single touch; - Glass & silk appear to be more highly electrical the oftener they are rubbed together; but Zinc & Silver ; - appear to acquire their full effect by a affected than glass but not so extensibely as the metal it is said to be an imperfect conductor . - . - All The conductors are all the Metals. with burnt charcoal , Plumbago - -. The nonconductors are ice vitrified substances in general - Oily substances in general , Sulphur Phosphorous , acids; whether solid or fluid when free from water from water Metallic calces or oxides , ice Metallic calces or oxides, ice dry saline bodies - aeriform xxxx substances in general. - The imperfect conductors are .- All the varieties of animal & vegetable substances imperfectly dry, fluids Water & solutions that contain water cases than in others . - . The difference to which I allude is in what is called their conducting power with regard to electricity; - If a metallic surface of glass be touched by an electrified body - It will exhibit electrical effects. in every only at the immediate point of contact; - This substance is called a nonconductor. - If a surface of Metal Gold Brass be touched; - placed upon glass - The ellectrical power will appear to be communicated to every part. This is said to said to be a conductor. - If a piece of wood be employed it will be more extensively successive contacts; - but in their positive & negative relations there are great differences. - . The same body that is positive with one substance will be often negative with another. Thus silk which is made negative by the contact of glass; becomes positive by the contact of sealing wax; & Tin which is negative by the contact of Zinc , is positive by the contact of Silver. - : - There is an important difference between different natural bodies with respect to electrical action which renders it very much more difficult to ascertain their states in some - Bodies that when electrified communicate the power of repulsion to very light substances are said to be in the same electrical state; & bodies that communicate the power of attraction are said to be in opposite electrical states - . - And when Bodies in repulsion, repel each other still more by the influence of electrified glass electrified by friction, they are said to be positively electrified: but if they loose their repulsions they are said to be negatively electrified. - . All the different bodies in Nature in which exp ts have been made exhibited electrified effects when 'made' to act each on each other by single or resinous or negative - The terms negative & positive are connected with the Hypothesis of one peculiar fluid in excess in some bodies in defficency in others producing all the effects; but as this is not yet proved, it is better according to the general views develloped in the introduction to take the arbitrary terms of Vitreous & Resinous - derived from the two bodies in which these antagonist powers were first observed -: but as the nomenclature is universally usually adopted employed in this country it seems better to preserve the xxx terms been in use; - with & this xxxxxxx may be xxxxx done without any adoption of the Hypotheses on which they were primarily founded Geology - \" If a Metallic surface be brought in contact with the silk - It will gain the same kind of power ie it will cause light bodies - in contact to repel each other -.

We soon reached the spot whence issued the late eruption only about two months ago the aperture is very small - Sulphureous steams issue from it in great quantities and large masses of Sulphur appear in its neighborhood - The ashes sand, Scoria , and lava of which the external past of the Crater is composed have no consistence - Hence you slip at every step but in slipping you make a footing. We had occasion to repose several times but by degrees we attained the summit. - The present Crater has been formed within the last century chiefly by eight great eruptions Its height according to Ferrara is 1800 feet the circumference of its Case 1200 feet The vew view which presented it self from the top of the Crater was perfectly new altogether different from what I had expected - As you have no object with which to compare the hollow you can form no accurate judgment by the eye of any of its dimensions. - The ground of the border is so hot as to burn the feet vapours issue from numerous orifices in it - And from the huge abyss itself arise volumes of thick smoke which darken the face of heaven and the colour of which is constantly varying - The sun seen through this smoke sometimes appears perfectly white and sometimes of a blood red colour, we looked with long and anxious expectancy for a favoured moment in which the currents of vapour might dispappear or become less dense so as to exhibit to us the interior of this wonderful Laboratory of Nature : but looked in vain We rolled down large stones with the hopes of being able to estimate the depth from the time of their descent. The ground shook under us as often as they struck against the side of the precipice and the sounds became fainter and more indistinct till they were gradually lost: but we had no reason to suppose that we heard the noise of their last fall. - Instance Spalanzoni as He himself relates was more fortunate as to the circumstances under which He beheld the Crater in Sep r 1788 - and unless He was much decieved He saw the very lowest part of the aperture I sat down says this Author near the edge of the Crater and remained there two hours I viewed with astonishment the configuration of the border the internal sides the form of the immense cavern. its bottom an aperture which appeared like the melted matter which boiled within and the smoke that ascended from it the whole of this stupendous was distinctly displayed before me; and I shall now proceed to give some descrepcion of it though it will only be possible to give present the read er with a very feeble image of a most grand and astonishing sight The upper edges of the Crater are about a mile and half in circumference - the sides are composed of rugged pieces of lava form a speices of funnel and abound with concretions of Sal ammonia The bottom is a horizontal plane about two thirds of a mile round - In this plane a circular aperture was visible from which issued a large column of smoke and when this smoke was impelled to the side opposite to that on which I was I can affirm that I perceived very distinctly a liquid ignited matter which continually indulated and boiled and rose and fell without spreading over the bottom and this certainly was the melted lava which had risen to that aperture from the bottom of the Etnean Gulf Instance The general aspect of a Volcanic district even in its most quiet state must be highly impressive but when the subterranean fines are displayed in their full energy when they burst forth from the interior of the earth desolating and destroying then the effect must be beyond all comparison the most awful and the most sublime of the phaenomena belonging to our Globe multiplied descreptions have been given of the eruptions of volcanoes - Philosophers have detailed them poets have painted them but language must necessarily fail when applied to such a purpose: and not even the most perfect delineation of the most perfect artist could do justice to a combination of circumstances in which feeling and hearing and sight are almost equally concerned. In which the Earth trembles - In which the continued sound of thunder dwells upon the ear, and in which the eye is constantly dazzled by lightening flashing above and by liquid fire streaming below - From the most accurate account it appears That before any great eruption takes place the mountain for a considerable time is more than usually tranquil and one of the most common indication of the approach of the event is a great stillness in the air slight tremblings of the earth and a drying up of the streams in the vicinity A voilent earthquake often accompanies the first great appearance of smoke and flame and the mountain is often in combustion for many days before any lava appears At other times however in cases when great explosions have taken place, the lava is thrown out at the same time with the smoke and flame: and this happened in the eruption of Vesuvius in 1794 one of the greatest recorded. The general progress and extensive evern effects of this event were minutely observed and have been accurately detailed by Sir W m Hamilton - And I trust that an abstract of a few of the most remarkable particularr taken from his paper published in the Ph s : Tran: for 1794 will not be found tedious They immediately belong to the subject of the lecture and will offer some curious elucidations of Theory. - The mountain says the illustrious Auther observer had been remarkably quiet for seven months nor did the usual smoke issue from the Crater; but at times it emitted clouds that floated in the air in the shape of little Trees - It was remarked that for some days preceeding the eruption a thick vapour was seen to surround the mountain about a quarter of a mile beneath its crater and the sun and moon had an unusual reddish colour cast. - The water of the great fountain and of the other to in the vicinity of Torre del Greco began to decrease The water at the great fountain of Torre del Greco and of the other springs in the vicinity began to decrease some days before the eruption. - On the 12 of June there was a violent fall of rain and soon after the inhabitants of Reseria situated directly over the ancient Town of Herculaneum were sensible of a rumbling subterraneous noise - and about 11 oClock at night a voilent shock of an earthquake was felt at Naples . On the fifteenth of June soon after 10 oClock at night an other shock occured: but not so voilent as that of the 12th. And at the same moment a fountain of bright fire attended with a very black smoke and a loud repost was seen to issue and rise to a great height from about the middle of the Cone of Vesuvius and soon after another of the same kind broke out at a little distance lower down and both the openings immediately poured forth lava - Fresh fountains of liquid fire succeeded each other hastily and in the space of a mile and half fifteen of them might be numbered, and others most probably were hidden by the smoke. It is impossible that any description can give an idea of this firy scene or of the horid horrid noises that attended this great operation of nature - It was a mixture of the loudest thunder with incessant reports like these from a numerous heavy artillery and accompanied by a continual hollow murmur like that of the rearing of the ocean during a voilent storm - There was an intermission at about 2 in the morning of the 16. but at 4 the Crater again shewed signs of a new action - And lava issued from a new opening on the other side of the mountain facing xxxxx Ottaiano and in a short time had passed over three miles of Ground and overwhelmed and burnt a considerable Wood - The upper part of Vesuvius was again soon involved in clouds and darkness: and so it remained for several days. but above these clouds fresh columns of smoke were continually rising till the whole mass had the form of a fine tree stretching to an enormous height in the Atmosphere and in that gigantic mass of heavy clouds flashes of forked lightning were constantly observed, so bright as to be visible in the day time. -At about six oClock in the morning of the 16 th the lava had reached the sea after having passed through and destroy d the greatest part of Torre del Greco It meet the waves with a hissing noise and with loud explosions and continued and some time to flow beneath them. Instance Some of the eruptions of Etna have been upon a scale still greater than even this of Vesuvius In the eruption of 1669 the effects were the most tremendous that have been noticed in any age on or in any country. These effects have been minutely described in a letter from Lord whin Lord Winchelsea to Charles the Second - His Lordship was an eye witness of the event and has related it with much strength of coloring and liveliness of description which even the quaintness of and ambiguity of his stile cannot obscure - I shall make no apology for extracting a few sentences from the Work - I accepted (says the Auther) the invitation of the Bishop of Catania to stay a day with him so that I might be the better able to inform your Majesty of the extraordinary fire which comes from Mount Etna 15 miles distant from that City, which from the horridness of its aspect for the vast quantity thereof (for it is 15 miles in length and 7 in breadth) for its monstrous devastation and quick progress may be terme an inundation of fire a flood of fire and glowing stones burning with such rage as to advance into the sea 600 yards and that to a mile in breadth which I saw - And that which did agu augment my admiration was to see in the sea this matter like rugged rocks burning in four fathoms of water and two fathoms higher than the waves - Some parts liquid throwing off the stones about them and causing a great and horrible noise in the water and other parts becoming solid making a firm foundation - When it was night I went upon the Tower and I could plainly see at ten miles distance the fire descending from the mountain in a direct line; and the flame ascending as high as the greatest steeple in your Majestys Kingdom and throwing great stones into the air - And I could discern the rivers of fire flowing down from the mountain of a bright red colour bearing upon it great stones of a paler red - I assure your Majesty no pen can express how terrible it was nor could all the Art or industry in the world have quenched it or diverted its course. In forty days time it had destroyed the habitations of 27.000 persons made two hills of a thousand paces high each of 20 000 persons that did inhabit Catania 3000 only did remain - The fire in its progress towards Catania The fire in its progress, towards Catania meet with a lake of 4 miles in compass and it was not satisfied by filling it up though it was four fathoms deep but it has made a mountain of it All the accounts that have been published of eruptions in other parts of the world agree in their general features, and from the similarity of the ir effects of Volcanic fires a strong conclusion may be formed concerning the similarity of their causes. - On this subject however a number of difficulties oppose themselves to our reasoning The agents concerned in those great suberraneous changes are hidden deep in the bosom of the Earth and it is impossible for us to contemplate them in their active state. Even their effects can only be considered at a distance and from the grandeur and awful nature of those effects it is ccarcely possible even for the most philosophical and couragious mind to examine with coolness and precision Here analogy must be our principle guide. Analogy investigated with caution and assisted by accurate experiment - Many enquirers into nature in attempting to account for volcanoes have supposed that a permanent central fire occupying the interior of the Earth is the universal cause of igneous eruptions - This notion is one which it requires little depth of research to adopt and but little acuteness of understanding fully to refute. Heat in all its states is capable of being communicated from body to body. And if a permanent fire had been acting for ages upon the interior of the crust of the Globe its effects must long ago have been perceived upon the whole of that surface which would have exhibited not a few evident widely scattered Volcanoes but one ignited and glowing mass - An opinion infinitely more probable is that Volcanic fires are the result of chemical changes of the intimate agencies of Bodies of inflamable matters producing voilent fermentations within the solid strata |_ Lemery in 1670 was the first person who brought forward this Theory und er any precise form and He founded it upon an experiment of his own invention He buried two parts of wetted Sulphur and one of Iron beneath the ground and a few hours they fermented heated and flame arose from the surface with slight explosions - Sulphur Lemery knew was of the common products of all Volcanoes and He knew that Iron abounded in the materials thrown out by them - His hypothesis was immediately pursued and these two agents appeared to him adequate for the explanation of the effects - He had not himself been a traveller into Volcanic countries and in his time all the observations made were superficial , transient and inadequate It is not the defect of his genius therefore if his theory be insufficient to explain the phaenomena it is the defect of the knowledge of his Age. - The late researches in experimental Science have shewn that Iron cannot be combined with Sulphur in the state in which it is commonly found in metallic veins or in mines or in Volcanic Countries and therefore no distinct conclusion can be formed from the artificial process on the paste of Iron and Sulphur with regard to the real cause of subterraneous fires _|_| Since the progress of the great discoveries in pneaumatic pneumatic chemistry many have been formed having for their foundation the original principal of the depesidance of Volcanic effects upon chemical action but few of them have been produced by enlightened experimentalist - The most sagacious of the Chemists of Europe hitherto have attended more to Art than to Nature. of the great changes produced in their experiments they have principally directed their researches to minute processes for chang changing the forms of matter and for supplying the various substances belonging to the Earth to the uses and comforts of man and occupied with those truly interesting objects they have as yet attended to the natural operations of the Globe and to the changes that took place above and below the surface - These departments of the science however offer whenever they shall be cultivated with ardour rich harvests of discovery: and even in the present infant state of the enquiry the few truths that have been ascertained with regard to them have principally resulted from Chemical investigation. The chief materials active in Volcanic eruptions must be newly combined during the time of their operation and such of them as are thrown out from the mountain altered by the agency of the Air - We can however reason only upon those substances that are actually discovered and though the facts known with regard to them are scanty yet they the will afford us very good foundations for theoretical discussion. The only known substance found in the bosom of our mountain which is capable of spontaneous inflamation from the effect of common Natural agents is pyrites And this body is one of the most generally diffused in nature. It is found in almost all rocks it forms veins and often occurs in considerable masses. Now the mere agency of water is sufficient to produce such a fermentation in loose masses of pyrites as to occasion their ignition of this truth there are numerous instances I will take one recorded by D r Platt in the history of Harffordshire - A Man called wilson says the Auther who lived at Ealand in Yorkshire having piled up many cart loads of pyrites in a Barn of his own for some secret purpose perhaps to extract the Gold - The roof being faulty and admitting rain water to fall copiously in amongst them they first began to smoke and at last to take fire and burn like red hot coals so that the Town was considerably disturbed and alarmed. During the fermentation of pyrites with water Sulphur is evolved and the same species of inflamable air which is given out from in the steams of Volcanoes. but there are other products of eruption which cannot be generated merely from such a caue cause - The only operation by fire which can take place in a large scale and in which Sal Ammoniac and Bitumen and fixed Air or Carbonic Acid all of which are common Volcanic products can be evolved is in the distillation - To those persons who have not been accustomed to consider the general series of chemical phaenomena this idea may seem to need experimental proof. It would be easy to offer many but I shall content my self with one Included in the top of this model there is a mixture of pyrites and coal with a little Oxymuriate of Potash a substance that will speedily supply to the pyrite Oxygene the principle necessary to its inflamation which water would only supply slowly when I touch the mixture with a little Sulphuric acid it will heat crackle and emit smoke - This must not be considered as an imitation of a volcanic fire for then it would be ridiculous, but as an illustration of the concealed active power of matter and I shall have occasion to offer more illustrations of the same kind in the next Lecture. And if we can concieve that the principle agents in the exicitation and preservation of Volcanic fires are pyrites and pit coal acted on by water and Air all the appearances would admit of an easy explanation. - // Sir Wm Hamilton has often remarked that in common seasons Vesuvius throws out most smoke and ashes when the tides are high and the wind blowing towards the shore which seems to imply some subterraneous communication between the interior of the Volanic crater and the sea - The drying up of rivers and springs likewise before great eruptions seem to affords another indicate that the water has some fact in favor of this agency share in the effect. Their Now assuming that immense masses of pyrites existed in Volcanic mountains diffused through beds of coal and in contact with Limestone Basalt and other rocks and supposing that they were acted on by water flowing in upon them from some new orifice evidentally made the first effect would be a production of heat and this head not being carried off by any current Air would constantly accumulate and increase the general series of changes - The elastic fluid evolved becoming of a high timperature would in consequence of its expansive power make strong efforts to escape by acting upon the incumbent strata and would produce trembling and agitations in the surface - In cases in which a crater already existed it would be discharged throw it in great explosions and would carry with it aqueous vapour and bituminous and sulphureous smoke. As the elastic fluid would be unequally discharged common air would be occasionally pressed in to supply its place. and a current would be established capable of inflaming the combustible matters even in the most profound parts of the mountain with this effect the phaenomena of ignition would begin The Sulphur coal and Bitumen in combustion would tend to fuse the compound stones in contact with them - carbonic acid gas would be produced and this and the other elastic vapours would necessarily tend to elevate portions of the melted mass into the upper part of the crater. The column of ascending smoke would in consequence be inflamed the lava would be poured forth and ignited stones projected into the Air - With every chemical change their is likewise a change in the states of electricity of bodies - And where such a series of Alterations were produced the electrified Vapours would necessarily give off their fluid to the surrounding conducting surfaces and the awful phaenomena of the ignited exploded matter would be rendered more sublime by lightnings and thunders - // I venture to give this theory as an imperfect sketch at present there is no time for a full discussion of it. on next Thursday I shall resume the subject and till that period I shall likewise defer the consideration of the general effects of Earthquakes and volcanoes in the order of nature. I already anticipate a number of objections to the theory: but before it can be fairly judged of the minuter facts belonging to it ought to be considered - At the first view it will perhaps appear too complex - Accustomed constantly to look for simplicity in Nature the mind can scarcely bring it self to believe that one great Phaenomena can be produced by a combination of minute causes Yet this as will be shewn often happens in the common and general series of Natural events. - Powers that having been operating silently and unperceived for ages sometimes produce their ultimate effects in moments the most diversified of the properties of bodies are often called into activity for one end And though the Laws that govern the material world are few and simple the agency that they direct are many and complicated and as various as the ir external appearances they Produce - [blank page] with a part of a system highly -. the -. restoration of the neutral power is accompanied with / takes place through the air; and & a spark accompanied by a snap is the result. - If the contact is made & in xxxxx the best torricellian vacuum , there is no spark, no striking distance; but the if the surfaces are small there is a violent ignition -. - In air the discharge takes place through a considerable distance & this probably depends upon the mobility of its parts; - those which are negative attracting those that are positive & producing the equilibrium - possibly producing Heat & light during the production of the equilibrium. - caused to approach them in the air; & if one cylinder be brought separated from the other, that being positive the air always in contact with it will be negative: and it is probable that in the air there are attractions of negative & positive; - for if a conductor be brought into the neighborhood of a conducter system near that part electrified + it will have its part opposite + -. its middle part will be 0. & its extreme part +. - This is usually called Electricity by induction - but it may be merely a communication of the electricities of air; & their exhibition - . When any part of a system strongly plus is brought in contact near that they are perfectly capable of balancing each other & of producing a neutral state - And if in a system the part that is positive be removed from the part that is negative - It immediately produces a corresponding negative state in Ionic contiguous system. or it becomes positive & negative in its own parts. - Description of an electrical machine before - Thus if one conducter be joined to another & they are both connected with an acting cylinder of glass so as to be +. - the air in contact will be - which will be shown by bodies being attracted when but in a system composed of imperfect & perfect conductors; there is a similar analogy law similar as that prevailing with respect to nonconductors, there may be in the same system many different states, Thus copper Zinc Silver Tin & water; if exchanged the Zinc & the copper be brought in contact with each other & water & Tin & silver zinc Silver be brought in contact with all the same portion of water & the Zinc & silver be connected by an another portion; there will be at least 4 different states - ie the Zinc will be + the copper +. the zinc Tin + the silver -. - In all cases in which positive & negative electricity exist; there is always such a coincidence difficult to say whether there are not always more than two states -.- When a rod of sealing wax is rubbed at one end, there is generally a positive surface just above the negative & another negative above the positive & so on .- - In the same system of perfect conductors; as far as our knowledge extends there seems to be but two states - Thus when Zinc & silver are in contact the Zinc is positive the Silver negative; & when they are separated these zinc states are rendered very obvious & then made to touch each other will give a very sensible taste .- And if they be made to connect, the nerves and muscles in any very vivacious the limb of a dead frog a frog recently dead, contractions will be produced similar to those dependant upon the powers of life. - In every system electrified by contact ; the two different states always exist & they may be considered as analogous to the two different states in magnetised bodies. - With respect to nonconductors it very often happens that; there are many alterations of the positive & negative states in the same system; & it is single contact & when separated are found the silver minus the Zinc positive . -:. One of t The most delicate in of the simple instruments for exhibiting the electricity of bodies are - The gold leaf Electrometer of Bennet . & the electrometer by torsion of Col Coulomb . - But a still more sensible test of Electrical charge is the animal function of irritability - The tongue will detect electricity which will not affect the gold leaves or the moveable balls. - Thus a piece of Tin & a piece of well burnt charcoal - When separately brought in contact with the toungue - some of the infammable compounds containing earths & alkalies. - [sketch of face in profile] The electicities of nonconduuctors can be easily exhibited because by successive contacts ie friction all their parts may be extensively made to touch each - & their electricity effect will be permanent; but in conducting bodies ; where the influence is rapidly comunicated to all the parts; - successive contacts are not so efficatious. & in general the full effe power is exhibited by a single touch; - Glass & silk appear to be more highly electrical the oftener they are rubbed together; but Zinc & Silver ; - appear to acquire their full effect by a affected than glass but not so extensibely as the metal it is said to be an imperfect conductor . - . - All The conductors are all the Metals. with burnt charcoal , Plumbago - -. The nonconductors are ice vitrified substances in general - Oily substances in general , Sulphur Phosphorous , acids; whether solid or fluid when free from water from water Metallic calces or oxides , ice Metallic calces or oxides, ice dry saline bodies - aeriform xxxx substances in general. - The imperfect conductors are .- All the varieties of animal & vegetable substances imperfectly dry, fluids Water & solutions that contain water cases than in others . - . The difference to which I allude is in what is called their conducting power with regard to electricity; - If a metallic surface of glass be touched by an electrified body - It will exhibit electrical effects. in every only at the immediate point of contact; - This substance is called a nonconductor. - If a surface of Metal Gold Brass be touched; - placed upon glass - The ellectrical power will appear to be communicated to every part. This is said to said to be a conductor. - If a piece of wood be employed it will be more extensively successive contacts; - but in their positive & negative relations there are great differences. - . The same body that is positive with one substance will be often negative with another. Thus silk which is made negative by the contact of glass; becomes positive by the contact of sealing wax; & Tin which is negative by the contact of Zinc , is positive by the contact of Silver. - : - There is an important difference between different natural bodies with respect to electrical action which renders it very much more difficult to ascertain their states in some - Bodies that when electrified communicate the power of repulsion to very light substances are said to be in the same electrical state; & bodies that communicate the power of attraction are said to be in opposite electrical states - . - And when Bodies in repulsion, repel each other still more by the influence of electrified glass electrified by friction, they are said to be positively electrified: but if they loose their repulsions they are said to be negatively electrified. - . All the different bodies in Nature in which exp ts have been made exhibited electrified effects when 'made' to act each on each other by single or resinous or negative - The terms negative & positive are connected with the Hypothesis of one peculiar fluid in excess in some bodies in defficency in others producing all the effects; but as this is not yet proved, it is better according to the general views develloped in the introduction to take the arbitrary terms of Vitreous & Resinous - derived from the two bodies in which these antagonist powers were first observed -: but as the nomenclature is universally usually adopted employed in this country it seems better to preserve the xxx terms been in use; - with & this xxxxxxx may be xxxxx done without any adoption of the Hypotheses on which they were primarily founded Geology - \" If a Metallic surface be brought in contact with the silk - It will gain the same kind of power ie it will cause light bodies - in contact to repel each other -. And a metallic surface from the glass will have a similar effect. but balls touched by the two surfaces will attract each other & if the two surfaces be connected all power will disappear. - It is said in the common language of Electricity that the two silk & the glass, & the metallic surface connected with the silk & the glass are electrified & that they are in different states. the electricity of the glass is called Vitreous or positive, & the electricity of the silk Sassafras[/ misc] The coffee plant and saffron all grow here saffron all grow here saffron all grow here in abundance.",
