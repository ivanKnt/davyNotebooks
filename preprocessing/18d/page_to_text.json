All those substances that act as manures are more or less transient in their effects. All those substances that act as manures are more or less transient in their effects. They are either converted into organized matter in the parts of living vegetables or they are decomposed and changed in consequence of their Chemical agencies. - The least durable of the manures are those that most immediately supply nourishment to the plant sooner or later they are decomposed and partily assimilated to its organs and the soil becomes exhausted of them - The manures which increase vegetation merely by their agencies are the substances contained in soils are more permanent But even they are continually modified at the time that they exert their powers and at length are converted into new",

  "7": "3 from the Atmosphere and of continually supplying the roots with a proper quantity of moisture. - As yet soils have been too little attended to be accurately classed according to their chemical composition and they are generaly distinguished from each other by their difference in their forms of their aggregation - The most usual soils are chalk Clays Clayey loams chalks and Calcareous loams Gravel soils stoney brashes or stoney soils silicious sandy soils calcareous sandy soils and peats - The primitive earths found in soils as I have already mentioned are alumine or the pure matter of Clay Silex or the earth of flints Lime and Magnesia",
  "9": "5 The alumine in soils is possessed of a strong affinity for water and it is to a great extent the cause of their tenacity - The silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth is less retentive of moisture than Aluminous Earth; but it renders the soil loose and fit for receiving the roots, of plants The Calcareous matter or carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime is extremely retentive of moisture Magnesia is seldom found in soils but its action in its Combined state is very analogous to that of alumine . - As different vegetables are nourished by food in some measure different and as they require to be supplied with it in different Soils. The nature of the soils which different vegetables demand must however in some measure depend upon the state of the sourrinding Atmosphere and upon the nature of the Subsoil the Subsoil or the Stratum in which the soil is situated . -",
  "11": "7 In dry climates the soil ought to be possessed of a Strong attraction for water moisture; and in this case it should contain a considerable proportion of aluminous and calcareous Earth - In moist climates the soil ought to abound in silicious earths which is possessed of a feeble affinity for water which in its common form of aggregation is much more permeable than alumine permeable than alumine The powers of Soils to attract moisture depend not only upon their chemical composition but upon their mechanical Structure. alumine , Lime and Silex when in a finely divided state absorb a much larger quantity of water than when forming an aggregated mass as sand or gravel - Instance These soils which are situated in declevities ought to be much more retentive of moisture than those situated in plains or in the bottom of Vallies",
  "13": "9 As has been already mentioned wheat Barley and most of the grasses require soils more tenacious and retentive of moisture than the plants producing bulbous roots; but that any peculiar composition of soil which would be the cause of fertilizing in one climate could not be taken as a standard in an other Climate where the circumstances of temperature and of evaporation were different. Thus in Cornwall the fertile soils consist s often of silicious and aluminous earths the quantity of Rain that falls upon a square foot annually is about 41 Inches according to M r Daltons M r Daltons M r Daltons tube in the Manchester memiors - It consists nearly 1/2 and the remainder alumine and Silex with scarcely any perceptable quantity of Calcar e ous matter -",
  "15": "11 A soil of this composition it is probable would contain much too large a proportion of sand to be fertile in the inland Counties of England where the fall of rain seldom exceeds 25 or 26 Inches a rich loam similar to that loam from stowess would be most likely too retentive of moisture in those Climates such as those of Westmoreland of Cornwall and of Cumberland - When soils are immediately situated upon a bed of rock or of stones they are much sooner rendered dry by evaporation in warm weather Where the subsoil is of Clay or Marle A Clayey subsoil will sometimes render fertile a sandy soil and in this case it will retain moisture in such a manner as to be capable of supplying that lost by the earth above in consequence of the actions of the dry the dry Atmosphere upon it -",
  "17": "13 A Sandy or a gravelly subsoil often corrects the imperfections of too great a degree of tenacity and absorbent power in the trees soil In Calcaseous Countries the soil is often found only a few inches above the Limestone and its fertility is not improved by the nearness of the rock though in a less absorbent soil this situation would occasion barreness. Instance Cornwall Instance Cornwall The absorbent power of a soil may be easily estimated by drying it before the fire at a temperature equal to about 212 Fah ht and then ascertaining how much it increases in weight by exposure of to the Air for a certain number of hours. I found that 100 grains of Marle from Stowey gained very nearly 3 grains in an experiment made in April in tolerably dry weather - estimated by drying it before the fire at an",
  "19": "15 The composition of soils and of subsoils considered in their relations to climate affairs general indications of their fertility but this essential property is influenced by some additional causes - Thus it is found that the north side of a Hill is usually more fertile than the south side other circumstances being the same The effect probably depends in some manner upon the influence of the Sun which tends to produce too rapid decomposition of the organizable matter of the soil. In this country likewise our heavy gales and rains are principally from the South west - and the fall of great rain would injure the soil by Causing some of the finely divided earth to be to be and vegetable matter to be washed away -",
  "21": "17 Those soils are often possessed of a peculiar degree of fertility which are situated at the feet of Hills and they receive from the water which flows over them a certain quantity of manure. The position of lands with regard to Cities and Towns it is likely may have some influence on their productive powers.- Very large quantities of smoke and soot and of animal effluvia are continually raised into the Atmosphere from large Cities and they are deposited at different distances or carried down by rain or dew and they contain elements useful as the food of plants. it is reasonable to conclude that the change produced in the Atmosphere around such a City as London must have some effect upon the lands in the surrounding County.",
  "23": "19 Sir Hy Vavasour Sir Hy Vavasour Sir Hy Vavasour sugested it as a question whether the fertility of the land to the East might not be particularly influenced by this cause ; as our westerly winds blow on a average for three fourths of the year and of course by far the largest quantities of soot and smoke and of effluvia would be carried eastward In considering the improvements of Soils by modifying the nature of their Earthy bases - the principles are sufficiently simple and obvious though it does not allways happen that the materials can be easily obtained All stiff and hard soils are improved by the addition of sand and gravel and in Cases when they are not loamy calcareous sand is more efficacious in rendering them fertile than silicious Sand. -",
  "25": "21 marles and chalks which are too retentive of moisture and too rich in Calcareous matter required to be supplied with silicious and alumin ous Earths In cases when Clay exist in a soil in great excess and in countries where silicious or calcareous Sand cannot be easily procured ploughing and Burning the land is sometimes employed with advantage as in this case the form of aggregation of the Clay is altered and its absorbent powers are considerably diminished.- instance In cases in which silicious sand exists in too great an abundance in soils Liming to a certain extent may be employed with advantage , Chalk and Marls tend in all cases to improve Soils that contain an of excess of alumine and Silex . And where burnt Lime burnt Lime is employed it at first acts as a secondary manure as has been",
  "27": "23 already stated and then becomes a part of the permanent Earthy basis of the Soil In applying Quicklime to common cultivated Lands as I have already stated the greatest care must be taken not to employ the Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone It may be known from the common Limestone by very simple chemical tests It is found in abundance in different parts of England Specimens - Matlock Breedon Derbyshire East Lothian East Lothian East Lothian East Lothian x Calcareous Earth in its caustic state soon becomes perfectly mild by combining with the Carbonic acid Carbonic acid Carbonic acid and water existing in the Atmosphere as is evident from what has been before said Magnesian Earth on the contrary after being once deprived of Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid by Heat",
  "29": "25 is an immense length of time in recovering it and in its caustic state it acts as a poison in destroying plants. M r Tennant M r Tennant M r Tennant found that seeds would not vegetate in a soil containing a certain proportion of pure Magnesia - Magnesia in its perfectly mild and native state does not appear to be at all injurious to vegetation It forms a part of certain soils which even in their common states are found productive as pastures The best Limestone is that which rapidly dissolves in Acids without leaving any residuum Limestone may be easily anal y ised by being acted upon by cold Muriatic acid Muriatic acid Muriatic acid if any solid matter remains it is aluminous or silicious earth silicious earth silicious earth -",
  "31": "27 When Magnesia is present it may be precipitated by pure Volatile Alkali or Ammoniac about 1/4 is added to its weight and the whole sub x tracted from the weight of the matter dissolved the remainder is the weight of the carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime which consists of about 2 parts of pure Calcareous matter and one part of Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Instance The Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone Magnesian Limestone in general contain about 40 p r Cent carbonate of Magnesia carbonate of Magnesia carbonate of Magnesia and 60 carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime carbonate of Lime . - This substance in its calcined state is most prejudicial to such soils as contain only a small quantity of vegetable decomposing matter and in cases when it has been accidently applied to them in large proportions it has rendered the Land barren for many years In soils that contain an excess of manure or of vegetable matter it is less injurious",
  "33": "29 and it has even been employed with good effects in the cultivation of peats. - This circumstance it is not difficult to explain astringent vegetable matters which usually exists in peats are capable of entering into chemical combination with Magnesia so as to form slightly soluble compounds with it - Lime should never be employed to Land in its dry or unslacked state unless it is designed unless for the purpose of destroying vegetable matter. In the finely pulverised state which it assumes by exposure to the Atmosphere it is capable of being aquably diffused through the soil It alters the form of aggregation it alters it alters of the other Earths during its combination with Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid Carbonic Acid",

  "37": "33 and in certain cases they be burnt with advantage when mixed with the Common soil - The method now generally adopted for improving peats so as to render them capable of bearing grain bearing grain is by the applicati application of Quicklime - In this case the Quicklime is mixed in its slacked and powdery state with the surface of the peat and that decomposing vegetable matter which before was unfavorable to the growth of useful plants is by means of its agency converted into a species of manure Those peats are most easily cultivated which are fixed upon a subsoil of Clay or of Earthy matter and which Contain the smallest quantity of living moss -",
  "39": "35 In cases when peats are very deep and impregnated with Bitumen or Sulphureous matters they are rendered fertile with great difficulty and they can only be freed from the noxious matters by long exposure to the Air in their state of mixture with Lime . - In the Derbyshire peat Hills where the stratum of peat is unus usually thin and superincumb -ent in loose clay lime is almost the only material found necessary for rendering the land productive And by means of successive applications of Lime and deep plough ing peat soils ing peat soils in Derbyshire are raised in value in the course of a few years from 1 shilling to 25 shillings the Acre -",
  "41": "37 In other countries in which peats are very deep and consisting chiefly of the slowly decomposing roots and fibres of vegetables and in the peats of moorland it is necessary to employ other substances with Lime which are capable of altering the form of aggregation of the peat - Clay sand and gravel are all useful in giving that consistency which is required to enable it to support the roots of the roots of the more perfect vegetables Decomposing Winstone or the soil incumbant on Basalt as there is every reason to believe might be employed with advantage - And in some Cases it is necessary to use a small quantity of dung for bringing the vegetable matter of the peat into a more rapid state of decomposition by fermentation -",
  "43": "39 In the common processes for changing the nature of lands by modifying the proportions of their earthy constituent parts the Farmer is seldom guided in his experiments by any fixed principles and his efforts are consequently often uncessful That the best method of improving soils may be adopted it is necessary that in each individual instance the chemical Composition should be known The minute Analysis of soils is connected with considerable labour and many difficulties but that examination of them useful for the purposes of Agriculture may be speedily accomplished and made with little trouble or expence",
  "45": "41 The apparatus required for the chemical examination of Soils is now before you It contains all the substances necessary and the most important parts of it are these bottles. The tests the funnel and the ballance tests the funnel and the ballance In cases in which the general nature of the soil of a Field is to be ascertained specimens of it should be taken in different places and separately examined so as to determine how far they differ. (for taking the average composition by mixing together different parts would afford no useful indication. 41",
  "47": "43 The water contained in a soil may be chiefly expelled from it by heating it to a degree equal to about 300 Fht and the proper temperature may be known by introducing a small piece of wood and examining it at different of the Process. The small stones gravel or large vegetable fibres may be seperated from the dry and divided soil by means of a sieve Instance To know wether any saline impregnations exists in soils noxious to vegetation it is necessary to pour boiling water upon a portion of them and if the fluid when passed through the filtre has no taste nor smell produces no change of tint on Litmus paper and no turpidness nor colour in Hepatic water we may be sure that it is free from saline",

And the best method of seperating these substances is working with common water",
