The advances made in Greece This country will indeed appear but as ignorance when compared with the discoveries & inventions of modern times, |_But it ought never to be forgotten that the it stream of knowledge which flows for us in such depths, fullness, in knowledge & strength xxxx had its origin in xxxxxx xx antiquity xxxxx was from that happy country that the sources of our own Science knowledge were either immediately or remotely derived. |_In Attica indeed the springs of knowledge were scanty & their course limited - xxxxxx for us they flow For us in depth in fullness & in strength : - but it is highly important to trace the progress of Philosophy 5 even from its most slender beginnings, It is interesting to view the Mind in the infancy of its improvement opposing its strength to the imperfection of its methods! & producing truth by destroying error: - |_And Scientific History offers instances no less instructive useful than interesting; - to the active Philosophical Enquirer; instances applicable to his pursuits & guides to his exertions. - At an Age when Egypt & India were enjoying a considerable share of cultivation & refinement - Greece was still uncivilised, & the habitation of a few savage and unconnected tribes of Men. - The Country was colonised by strangers from the South & East 6 who brought with them Arts & inventions; |_but the knowledge of the first advancement of the population. & improvement of the country was lost in the fables of the Heroic Ages. - |_Amidst the turbulence of the first efforts made by a people to rise out of the barbarous state, there could exist no leisure for meditation |_& no minute views ; except those connected with the passions or the Wants of Man. - |_In the infancy of the discovery of alphabetical characters, Verse , & words arranged according to an harmonious succession of sounds seems to have been the first mode of communicating & preserving instruction -. |_Where 7 knowledge was chiefly traditional; it was become necessary not only convenient, but essential to employ such methods , |_as they at once; assisted the memory & combined information with pleasure . - The fragments of the Poems of orpheus & the immortal productions of hesiod & of Homer afford us almost the only documents for judging of the early state of Greece . - In those tale descriptions though highly interesting though capable of giving the most exalted pleasure there is however nothing little to arrest the attention of the Historian of Natural Science . - orpheus is the poet, of a Cosmogony ; of an account of the origin of things, possessing the same features as those of the oriental nations, & evidently derived 8 from the same source. - |_ hesiod in his works & days has occasionally refers to a species of astronomical knowledge & describes several of the constellations - And He connects their appearances with the change of seasons - His Authorities seem however rather the observations of Shepherds & Husband = men than those of Philosophers. They seem appear to have had no relation to any system of Science existing in his Age; |_& are such, |_ as then exposed to the elements & in a great measure dependent upon them, would be compelled to collect by the strangest motives, to collect in almost every age & every Climate 9 - In the Iliad & the Odyssey which from their character; would seem to be the productions of a later Age ; - the exploits, the virtues & the vices of heroes & of men seem to occupy the great attention of the Father of heroic poetry - |_Even the Gods no longer appear in their connections with the phenomena of Nature but are cloaked in Human forms & clothed endowed with human attributes & passions . In the time of Homer of Homer the Greeks had greeks had risen far above the Agricultural & pastoral state, they were beginning to be connected Beginning to accumulate in Cities; The business of War of political institutions, the 10 bustle of active life & the growing inventions in the Arts were however sufficient to absorb their attention & employ all the acuteness & strength of their minds. - The Greeks of who inhabited the Sea coast of Asia Minor arrived first at that degree of refinement essential to the true cultivation of philosophical literature & of the observation of Nature - Devoted to commerce the spirit of the enquiry seemed natural to their minds - |_ About the seventh century before Christ they were rich & powerful & in a profound peace - |_ A people of genius possessing liberty of thought & the power of free discussion They were ready to 11 embrace information the moment it was offered to them |_ & their religious systems had lost all that stamp & complexion belonging to them in the east. They no longer bore any relations to Natural truths, but were mere ceremonies of idolatry performed, by priests & soothsayers generally as credulous & as ignorant, as the vulgar to whom they administered them. - The first school of Philosophy was established in Ionia - And The founder of it was Thales the Miletian - More is accurately known concerning the incidents of the life of this ancient Philosopher than of the tenour of His opinions - his rank was high, his political influence great - |_ but his Ambition was rather 12 directed towards instructing, these Man than governing them. - and He travelled through Greece , Egypt & phoenicia in quest of Knowledge ; which it is said He was as ready to receive communicate as to communicate receive -. Thales left behind him no writings - & of the spirit of his Philosophy, changed by time - modified by his disciples , & interpreted into or blended with other systems it is difficult to form an accurate judgment ; - |_the Ionic sect certainly however sought into Nature with the views of experimentalists; & their Geometry their astronomy & their general physics as far as the relics of them are known prove accurate observation, amidst imperfect methods, - & they often exhibit grand conceptions & bold 13 conjectures some of which have been realised in modern times. - -The beautiful grand opinion of Thales in Physics \" that which is certainly known to belong to him-.\" was that Water was is the composing principle of all things. This notion has passed into the writings of philosophers, & the works of the Poets - Pindar alludes to it in his celebrated ode \" Water is the best \" - & it renders the passage intelligible & bold, when it would have been otherwise obscure & common. - -- To a person not enlightened by modern Chemistry it is in indeed easy to conceive that Water would appear one the first & most productive of Elements - Its vivifying agency upon plants & animals 14 - Its precipitation from Air - Its apparent conversion into earth might well encourage the idea ; & the marine Venus of the Ancients rising in life & beauty from the bosom of the Sea; seems a representation of the productive energy ascribed to water by the philosophers of the elder School .- - Thales was considered as the inventor or at least the introducer of Geometry , amongst the Greeks - It is said even that He carried the Science far beyond the Egyptians X who were the first that X applied it to practice - |_ If X the Anecdote recorded of be correct.- of his measuring the pyramids by their shadows a method unknown in Eygpt it does not so much prove the acuteness of 15 The Thales , as the ignorance of the Egyptians. - \"|_ He is said to have fixed a staff of a known length perpendicular ; to have measured the its shadow & likewise to have measured the shadow of the great pyramid; & His conclusion was that as the length of the shadow of the staff was to the height of the staff so was the length of the shadow of the pyramid to its elevation.- Several practical proportions with regard to the triangle are said to have been ascertained by Thales - Many of those demonstrated in the first and second books of Euclid . - |_From all that remains of the first Geometrical Labours of the Ionic School it would appear that their Science Geometry was a practical & not a speculative Science - A 16 Creation of Experiment; & not a work of the Human Mind founded upon self evident propositions truths & definitions . - |_The abstract & speculative demonstrations of the doctrines there is every reason to believe were ascertained long after the practices themselves had been invented; |_but constituting the language & the expression of the Science; they became at last the very Elements of it; so as to appear to common observers original ; & foundations , not established upon facts but upon the refinements of Human Reason . - The accounts given of the Astronomical knowledge of Thales prove that it was of a 17 much higher character than that of his Geophysical Geometrical acquisitions - Plutarch informs us that it was his opinion \" that eclipses of the Sun are occasioned by the intervention of the Moon between the Earth & that great source of Light . |_\"& that the eclipse of the moon is caused occasioned by the shadow of the Earth. which coming between these two celestial bodies body & the sun darkens the Not which shines only by the moon reflected light - of the moon |_These dogmas as is currently known in so correct an expression of the real fact as in xxxx Known & it prove either the strength of talent & the minuteness of observation of the Miletian philosopher , or the refinement of the more ancient Science, whence 18 his information was might have been derived. - Thales xxxxxxxx if we may credit the most ancient of the Greek Historians was not only acquainted with the causes of the Eclipses but was able likewise to predict the times in which they would occur; |_but this His great knowledge it is said he never applied for the purposes of deception but freely communicated & explained in the true spirit of an enlightened Mind . - He is recorded as having made fixed the division partition of the sphere Earth into five zones & to have divided the year into 365 days. - |_All his biographers assert agree that he devoted a 19 great portion of his time to the study of the heavenly bodies & the constellations. - And He is the original subject of that ancient & common tale of the \"Astronomer who fell into a well whilst gazing at the stars, who surveying what was above his reach head neglected what was below his feet\" - The Genius of Thales (from all accounts) was not bounded by physical investigations, A number of his moral axioms are recorded |_ & his precepts have been given in Verse by Ausonius . - |_The strength of some of his expressions show that He was a Wit likew as well as a Philosopher. And he is said to have been dismissed 20 from the court of Amasis King of Egypt on account of the Boldness of his opinions - When Being asked for instance by a smooth off Courtier of that despotic Prince \" which was the most dangerous of Beasts. \"He is said to have answered & of wild beasts a Tyrant & of tame beasts a flatterer .\" - Thales had the dangerous title of wise bestowed on him; & he was one of the seven sages who flourished in the era of the rising splendour of Greece . - He is a principal personage in the banquet of the Wise Men described by Plutarch & which in the detail of the Historian is as stupid as an entertainment can be supposed to be in 21 in which seven wise & seven prudent persons Wise Men are made to sit down for the very purpose of saying nothing but wise & prudent things. - In the Age of Thales Philosophy was rep respected & honoured; He was considered as a Benefactor to his country - And lived in the fullness of Glory to a good old Age. |_He died about 548 before C t at the Olympic Games. And his countrymen now honoured him with a xxxx monument & with an inscription composed in the fine usual style of simplicity of the Greek Epigram. - Here Thales rests \"the Wise\" The Heavens attest his fame Small his tomb But Great his fame Attested by the skies. 22 - The reputation of the Ionian School was preserved after the death of Thales by His Disciple Anaximander who xxxxxx is said to have been profound Admirer is said to have been no servile imitator of the Elder Philosopher. - His opinions seem however to have been less distinctly recorded or more confusedly delivered -;- 23 24 - Thales had many Disciples even amongst the Rich & Great Men of his own Nation; |_but none of them are recorded in History as having modified or extended his doctrine except Anaximander . - |_This ancient appears however; if the opinions attributed to him are correctly detailed appears to have been guided more by the love of Novelty than the gift of right reason in attempting alterations of the Dogmas of his Master. |_Thus He is said to have attributed eclipses not to the intervention of the Moon or Earth; but to the closing of an orifice in the Sun or Moon from which He supposed the light to issue. - and He Anaximander denied that water 25 was the composing element of bodies |_& asserted that infinity was the principle of all things -|_The last Philosopher of the Ionic School who continued at Miletus was Anaximenes , the friend , the follower & at last the rival of Anaximander . - |_The peculiarity of his physical doctrine consisted in his attributing to Air a power almost unlimited of composing bodies, of changing & of acting upon them - He explained the formation of clouds by the condensation of an aerial vapour: & rain He considered as produced from these clouds by the conversion of Air into water; & Hail & show by the freezing of Rain. - |_He was well acquainted with the cause remote cause of the Rainbow; xxxxxx though not with the refined Philosophy of the separation of light 26 We are informed by Plutarch - He conceived the Rainbow as originating in the refraction of light |_through clouds or mists ; - but no explanation is adduced of the variety of its colours. . - The Philosophy of Ionia was brought into Attica by Anaxagorus who was at once a Glory & a reproach to the Country in which He fixed His abode - A Glory |_in consequence of his discoveries & his meretorious public labours - A reproach in consequence of from the severe & unjust persecution He sustained - -- He was born at Clazomene & He fled himself was removed at to Athens about 460 B Christ in the first year of y e 75 Olympiad. at a time when that celebrated city was gaining the ascendancy in Greece ; at the time when Her spirit of Liberty & her patriotic Zeal were most warmly displayed 27 in y e war against the Persians . - |_ When Anaxagoras first taught in the Schools of Athenians Athens , His doctrines excited general admiration ! |_To the Inhabitants of this rising City physical truth was new; & their love of Novelty & their caprice , alone were sufficient to give a temporary impulse to Scientific investigation - Pericles the greatest general & the most accomplished orator of his Age was amongst the first of his Scholars - Archelaus & Socrates were initiated by him into the study - |_and Euripides is said to have been one of the most attentive of his auditors till the popular clamour began to be raised against philosphy when He fortunately relinquished Science for tragic poetry. - The Doctrines of Anaxagoras are of a much higher, more accurate & more impressive character than those of any of his predecessors 28 of any of his predecessors -- |_His Mind evidently was endowed with strong powers of Genius: - And the age in which He lived , is sufficiently enlightened by History , to enable us to determine: that a number of his conceptions were perfectly original ; not borrowed from the stores of Asiatic learning; but the production of his own active & acute understanding . - Anaxagoras relinquished the unphilosophical idea of any one element being the germ & the producer of all the forms of matter; & attempted to show that all uniform bodies were composed of a number of similar or elementary parts, differing however in their nature in different bodies. cases - This opinion has been much misrepresented particularly by Lucretius; Who attempts to shew that the supposed organized substances composed of little really infinitely small organized parts; - but such an 29 idea of his doctrine is given neither in the Works of Aristotle nor of Plutarch who may both be supposed more accurate than the Roman Poet the great object of whose poem Work, was to elevate the Epic Epicurean doctrine above all others, & to attempt to shew that the universe resulted from a particular mixture of Atoms.- |_The opinion dogma when viewed in the most liberal sense appear to bear some relation to the more extended generalization of modern Chemistry. with regard to elements, all in which they are supposed to consist of similar parts & in which no limit is fixed to their number or to the xxx except or combinations, except such as are authorized by experiment . - Anaxagoras supposed that is said to have supposed that lightning was produced by Ether confined in clouds; & that Wind was occasioned by the rarefaction of Air by the solar light Heat - Both these opinions display singular 30 strength of Mind - these xxxxx notions less distinct are attributed to him on the same subject He certainly could not have divined the nature of the electrical fire ; but His distinct judgment led him to perceive that \" a powerful & more subtle agent than any commonly displayed in the Atmosphere or on the earth was necessary to the effect. - He is said by Aristotle to have asserted that the Galaxy or milky way is the produced by the blended light of a number of small stars |_but other Authors attribute to him less correct opinions to him with regard to this phaenomenon . - He was the first person who asserted that the moon was a ball globe like the earth & habitable And that the other heavenly bodies were likewise composed of similar materials: |_The remarkable fact that He adduces as a proof of his assertion 31 \"that stones have often fallen from above\" I mentioned in the Geological lectures.\"- These very ancient Two very ancient writers quoted by Plutarch & Aristotle Silenus & Damachus are positive as to the event of a large stone having fallen in Thrace a large fiery meteor body having been seen in the sky before; & the fall is said to have been connected with flashes of fire & scintillations like falling stars. - Superstition has added that Anaxogoras had predicted the fall of this very stone in the 4 th year of the seventh olympiad,\" & that it portended the great defeat given to the Athenians N the riv by Lysander at the river Egos no less a time than sixty two years after. - the narrations are however exceedingly curious - The story was disbelieved by most of the ancients & till within the last 20 years by all the moderns; multiplied observations 32 have now shewn \"that stones actually have fallen in great numbers on the earth . & chemical analysis has proved that they are all of the same species & perfectly different from any fossils known to belong to our globe; - |_And arrived at a variety of opinions that have been formed with regard to their origin , the first conjecture of the philosopher of Clazomene \"that they fall from the heavenly bodies is perhaps as probably as any other. - -. The Natural philosophy of Anaxogoras contains singular & striking truths; xx xxxxxxx but His general Notions concerning the universe , the Harmony of things & the first cause of Being are xxx a much more impressive & wonderful character than any of his physical truths - |_He is the first Philsopher recorded 33 who asserted the existence of one supreme & intelligent mind, ruling & directing all things. - The sublime doctrine is attributed to him by Aristotle xxxx by Plato - Anaxogoras in consequence of his profession of this doctrine was sur named Nous or Nȣσ \" or the Mind & his ideas seem to have been of as high & as dignified full as xxx sublime & more distinct than those of the Platonic philosophers who came many ages after him . - Thus He is quoted by Cicero & Laertius as calling the supreme spirit infinite & self moving - not in included in matter but superior to it who when all was confusion produced order & who by His energy still preserves all things in Harmony. 34 -|_ The influence of the Anaxogoras in modifying the public character of this his disciple was great & beneficial . - He first taught the warriors Pericles & many of the other & great illustrious men, of Athens to despise the omens & the predictions of the soothsayers ; which had formerly directed all their exploits - When a Ram was produced at Athens with only one Horn - The Citizens were in the greatest distress supposing that it the prodigy portended great evils to the state - Anaxagoras disected the head & calmed the people: by shewing that it was the effect of an internal conformation of the scull. - Pericles himself by means of the knowledge He had acquired from the philosopher was enabled to 35 impure spirit into his sailors & soldiers terrified at an eclipse of the Sun - He made his cloak represent the Moon , & held it between himself & the Sun source of light - The explanation was received, & mark the battle was gained fleet clam sailed on prosperous & victorious.- - Anaxagoras ; in the high conviction of truth dared to attack upon all occasions the popular superstitions of Attica - He soon became obnoxious to the Augers & Priests who trembled for their decay of their power & influence wealth; He was persecuted by them & at last brought to trial .- - The principal accusation against him as would appear from the most accurate authorities \"was that He had asserted the Sun to be burning mass larger than pelopenesus \" This was regarded 36 as an impiety for the Athenians worshipped this luminary as a god. - Anaxagoras has had no worthy biographer; - & if Plato or Xenophon had described this incident of its his life, there is every reason to believe that it would have come down to modern times with as high an interest & as powerful an effect as the ever memorable end of Socrates .- - The first philosopher who had ever taught on the continent of Greece \"the man who had devoted forty years of his life to the service of his country; whose moral character was without a stain & who had given up his xxxxxx lands & his property that He might have nothing to withdraw his Attention from Science objects of 37 Science & utility - This man in his old age, in sickness & in poverty; was brought before a tribunal which after had endeavoured to instruct & enlighten - This man who had professed the most sublime & exalted ideas religious ideas ever entertained by a Heathen was brought before a tribunal which he had endeavoured to enlighten in his old age in sickness & in poverty before a tribunal counsel the members of which had been often instructed by his talents He was accused of blasphemy & condemned to die! - the reply of Anaxagoras to his Judges when he Heard his His conduct at the time of his trial sentence pronounced was worthy of his Character , worthy of the man who in the beginning of his career had said that the end of his existence was to enquire into nature & that his country was the Heavens . - He is said to have addressed 38 himself to the tribunal in this Man - You have passed sentence on me When he heard his sentence pronounced . -He simply said to the Judges. - Nature has condemned us all to die you was well as me! - It is asserted by some writers Historians that he was actually put to death; whilst others say that at the interception of Pericles - he was saved & banished the city for life .- he lived 20 years after his trial at Lampsacum ; & several of his sayings of his are recorded as delivered in that city. - For I shall mention two - one Of which supposing them accurate The last class report that 39 one equally denotes the unbroken firmness of his mind, & the other the Kindness & goodness of his heart. - Being asked whether He was sorry \"that He had lost the Athenians - He answered no, \"but I greive that they have lost me! - The Citizens of Lampsacum enquired if they could do any thing for him after his death. When he begged only \"that the school boys might annually have a holiday & permission to play in the day of His decease.\" a request which Laertius asserts was granted; & the cunstom continued for many centuries. - With By Anaxogoras \"the glory of the Ionic School had been carried to its greatest pitch; & after his death 40 it was no longer supported by great or imposing talents; |_ Archelaus [/underline] the Master of Socrates , as far. was the imitator of the elder Philosophers ; but n nothing original rec is attributed by to him; & the systems founded of reasoning founded by Thales & perfe the opinions belonging to it , were soon attached to new generalizations . |_ New schools speedily succeeded each other .- And the spirit of emulation & rivalship amongst the Philosophers of the Warriors of Greece was reigned - as strongly amongst the philosophers of the refined Greece , as amongst the Warriors, the poets & the Artists - -. The School that after the Ionic most flourished in the great period of Greek Grecian Civilization, 41 & that Which produced the greatest number of illustrious men was called the Italic from its being founded by Pythagoras at in Crotona in Italy . by Pythagoras .- - A number of the doctrines of Pythagoras have reached us but few authentic accounts remain wh concerning his life; - while the incidents of which by most of his fellows have been obscured by his most of his followers by in mystery & fable & made not merely wonderful , but even miraculous . - He is reported by Hermippus to have been born at Samos & his father is said to have been a n maker engraver of rings -. But Iamblicus says that He was generally considered by his disciples as of divine origin & the Son of Appollo . - whilst some did not scruple to say affirm that was & that which produced the greatest number 42 He himself was the God - The Hyperborean apollo - All accounts agree that He was an indefatigable traveller; & that He journed like Thales to every part of the South & East, where access could be gained & information procured .- |_ It is said that He passed some time in phonicia ; & remained 22 years in Egypt & spent 12 years in Babylon . - -|_That the Egyptians & Chaldeans disclosed to him their most hidden doctrines reconditet doctrines; there is every reason to beleive; & the spirit of his doctrines opinions & the ceremonies of his institutions seem equally to have been borrowed from the East. - 43 -|_ The idea of the Motion of the Earth & its revolution round the Sun is seems the great feature of the Astronomy of the Pythagorean School.- And this sublime truth it is evident could never have been the result of the observations made in a single life; but must have required for its devellopment the accumulated Knowledge of Ages; the labours of many individuals & refined methods of examination .- -|_ Pythagoras is said to have been well acquainted with five of the planets - & He fixed their distance from the sun in a an arithmetical proportion of numbers - & He is said fixed is stated to 44 to have attributed to the revolution of Saturn nearly its real period of nearly 30 years ; which was considered as the great year .- cycle.- Pythagoras is said to have first discovered the monochord , & to have found out the proportion & concord of sounds |_& to have expressed them in numbers. - That the Harmonic proportion was really a work of his own investigation appears from all authorities; |_& the constant application made of the invention in the general system proves the high importance that was attached to it. - Thus in the beginning of very infancy very infancy of the school it was supposed beleived that the planets moving seven stars ie the five planets & the Sun & Moon. . rotate as they 45 moving with different velocities, & being of different magnitudes must produce different tones by impressing the elastic medium supposed to surround them; - |_And all the facts were tortured \"to shew that these sounds must be in harmony, And the opinion was has been current for nearly two thousand 500 years |_& has formed an interesting & a beautiful analogy for the poets both of early & of late times. - -\"Thus the Father & the Master of the English Drama has connected it with the most beautiful & fascinating & interesting romantic images. - How sweet the Moonshine, sleeps upon this bank! Here will We sit, & let the sounds of music Creep in our ears! Soft stillness & the night Become the touches of sweet harmony Sit Jessica - Look how the floor of heaven 46 Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdst But in his motion, like an Angel sings, Still quiring to the Young eyed Cherubim. Such harmony is in immortal Sounds |_ All the faculties of Pythagoras appear to have been absorbed in the endeavour to discover in the general elements facts of Science analogies, to harmony & proportion \"Thus He conceived the elements of all bodies to consist of xxxx four regular forms which by their union in symmetry produced fire & Air & fluid & solid bodies! & by their mixture in discord or in varying propertions all the other more complicated forms, of matter. |_ This idea is originally delivered 47 was certainly no more than the vision of an enthusiastic Mind; though it now appears to bear a distinct relation to the doctrine of the resolution of all crystalised bodies, into a few simple forms, a doctrine first develloped by Romé de Lisle ; |_ but the great difference between the ancient doctrine, & the modern is that the ancient doctrine was a mere speculation, formed to serve a particular set of opinions & the ancient modern was deduced from facts, observed accidentally & pursued on account of their striking & peculiar nature. - 48 - |_ Pythagoras in accounting for the arrangment of matter is said to have referred in all cases in to a supreme & intelligent cause though his notions are appear to have been much less definite than those of Anaxagoras - |_ He is said by Plutarch to have conceived considered the supreme essence as accessible & intelligent; ; but as interfused through all things & the animating soul or spirit of the World - And He supposed that the most perfect presence of the one intelligence active power was displayed in the Gods as (the objects of the worship of the Heathens) in Daemons & in 49 And but likewise considered it Heroes but He likewise considered it but He supposed that held it was as interspersed in all as existing in all matter things animate & in whether evidently living , or apparently dead. - |_The idea of this School is fully develloped by Virgil - both in the Eneis & the Georgics & in the Eneis the Eneid .- - In the Eneis in the sixth book. I shall read Drydens translation - Know first \"that Heaven & Earths compacted frame And flowing Waters, & the starry frame And both the radiant lights, one common Soul Inspires & feeds |_& animates the whole.- \"- In the Georgics in the fourth book\" I shall read M r Sothebys translation Each at its birth from him all beings share Both Man & Brute, the breath of vital Air developed 50 There all return\" & loosed from earthly chain Fly whence they sprung, & rest in God again Spurn at the Grave & fearless of decay Live midst the Host of Heaven. - And star the Ethereal way. - When the sublimer spirit of the Pythagorean doctrine is considered, it is impossible not to wonder at the number of superstitions connected with the laws & institutions of the cult . Sect. -. Pythagoras required his followers to pray not only to y e common idol Gods of the people, but likewise to inferior spirits & even to the Souls of departed Heroes 51 - The experienced disciples professed divination & the Art of interpreting dreams -. They offered a number of sacrifices to idols; but they were principally of Vegetables . - They had a particular set of rules by which they lived & in which the quantity of meal, drink sleep & conversation that they were allowed to enjoy was precisely measured out to them. - The Disciples Scholars for probation were obliged to submit to the afliction of bodily pain & long fasting in order to demonstrate their constancy; & were condemned to a silence which some say was for five years in order to prove exibit try their prudence - . All the pythagoreans professed a double doctrine one for the initiated & the other for the people. - 52 - And it is related that it was on account of this Circumstance the Mystery of the Sect that the School was that the School Sect was persecuted by the Inhabitants of Crotona who were of a very inquisitive spirit & who wished to have all the mysteries explained, pythagoras refused their request - The people not being permitted to enter into the School set fire to it & drove the philosophers out of the City. - -: A number of precepts & of Symbols of the pythagoreans are preserved by Iamblicus some few convey moral truths; but others exhibit the grossest Superstition , & from the general tenour of the ceremonious part 53 of the system seems to prove \"that Pythagoras though the first to adopt the name of Philosopher, had some of the same views & intentions as His oriental Masters in the Science ; |_but the spirit of the times were was opposed to them, & the general recondite principles of Knowledge of the School though at first concealed were by degrees develloped & at last made Known both in public instructions & in public writings writings. in their pure form, so as to become the property of all Minds which they were capable of enlightening. - The principal ornaments of 54 the first Pythagorean School ; are who disclosed the System of Philosophy axxxxxx - The names of a number of Philosophers who followed the Philosophy of Pythagoras are - Few philosophical doctrines have spread more rapidly than the Pythagorean . And the names of a number of the professors of the system & educated in the first school - Many Philosophers less than fifty years after the death of Pythagoras which happened 497 years before C. were found in different parts of Europe & asia - professing openly the doctrine of the School & teaching it without reserve . 55 - Amongst these the most celebrated are Timeus the Locrian - Epicharmus of Coos - Archȳtas of Tarentum & Empedocles of Sicily . - A fragment of Timeus is extant on the Soul of the World ; & it contains the precisely the same doctrines as those which have been described in the account of the School of Crotona . - Of Epicharmus little is Known except that he left his native country very young & settled at Syracuse - Where He was persecuted during the whole of his life; & had 56 a splendid monument erected to him after his death. - On which an inscription was placed stating that His glory exceeded that of all other Philosophers as much as the light of the Sun exceeds that of the Stars\". - Archȳtas is celebrated on account of his mechanical Skills - And He is said to have invented several Hydraulic machines |_& to have made a bird pigdgeon of wood, which was capable of flying by automatic power. - There are no remains of his physical opinions except that are given except in a speculative work on the Nature of the universe , which relates much more to metaphysical 57 explanations of terms, than to Natural Science - |_ His death which has is said to have been occasioned by a shipwreck is mad made a subject of poetical description in an ode of Horace , who celebrates His great talents. Archytas , what avails thy nice survey Of Oceans Countless sands; of Earth & Sea?

|_To the Inhabitants of this rising City physical truth was new; & their love of Novelty & their caprice , alone were sufficient to give a temporary impulse to Scientific investigation - Pericles the greatest general & the most accomplished orator of his Age was amongst the first of his Scholars - Archelaus & Socrates were initiated by him into the study - |_and Euripides is said to have been one of the most attentive of his auditors till the popular clamour began to be raised against philosphy when He fortunately relinquished Science for tragic poetry. - The Doctrines of Anaxagoras are of a much higher, more accurate & more impressive character than those of any of his predecessors 28 of any of his predecessors -- |_His Mind evidently was endowed with strong powers of Genius: - And the age in which He lived , is sufficiently enlightened by History , to enable us to determine: that a number of his conceptions were perfectly original ; not borrowed from the stores of Asiatic learning; but the production of his own active & acute understanding . - Anaxagoras relinquished the unphilosophical idea of any one element being the germ & the producer of all the forms of matter; & attempted to show that all uniform bodies were composed of a number of similar or elementary parts, differing however in their nature in different bodies. cases - This opinion has been much misrepresented particularly by Lucretius; Who attempts to shew that the supposed organized substances composed of little really infinitely small organized parts; - but such an 29 idea of his doctrine is given neither in the Works of Aristotle nor of Plutarch who may both be supposed more accurate than the Roman Poet the great object of whose poem Work, was to elevate the Epic Epicurean doctrine above all others, & to attempt to shew that the universe resulted from a particular mixture of Atoms.- |_The opinion dogma when viewed in the most liberal sense appear to bear some relation to the more extended generalization of modern Chemistry. with regard to elements, all in which they are supposed to consist of similar parts & in which no limit is fixed to their number or to the xxx except or combinations, except such as are authorized by experiment . - Anaxagoras supposed that is said to have supposed that lightning was produced by Ether confined in clouds; & that Wind was occasioned by the rarefaction of Air by the solar light Heat - Both these opinions display singular 30 strength of Mind - these xxxxx notions less distinct are attributed to him on the same subject He certainly could not have divined the nature of the electrical fire ; but His distinct judgment led him to perceive that \" a powerful & more subtle agent than any commonly displayed in the Atmosphere or on the earth was necessary to the effect. - He is said by Aristotle to have asserted that the Galaxy or milky way is the produced by the blended light of a number of small stars |_but other Authors attribute to him less correct opinions to him with regard to this phaenomenon . - He was the first person who asserted that the moon was a ball globe like the earth & habitable And that the other heavenly bodies were likewise composed of similar materials: |_The remarkable fact that He adduces as a proof of his assertion 31 \"that stones have often fallen from above\" I mentioned in the Geological lectures.\"- These very ancient Two very ancient writers quoted by Plutarch & Aristotle Silenus & Damachus are positive as to the event of a large stone having fallen in Thrace a large fiery meteor body having been seen in the sky before; & the fall is said to have been connected with flashes of fire & scintillations like falling stars. - Superstition has added that Anaxogoras had predicted the fall of this very stone in the 4 th year of the seventh olympiad,\" & that it portended the great defeat given to the Athenians N the riv by Lysander at the river Egos no less a time than sixty two years after. - the narrations are however exceedingly curious - The story was disbelieved by most of the ancients & till within the last 20 years by all the moderns; multiplied observations 32 have now shewn \"that stones actually have fallen in great numbers on the earth . & chemical analysis has proved that they are all of the same species & perfectly different from any fossils known to belong to our globe; - |_And arrived at a variety of opinions that have been formed with regard to their origin , the first conjecture of the philosopher of Clazomene \"that they fall from the heavenly bodies is perhaps as probably as any other. - -. The Natural philosophy of Anaxogoras contains singular & striking truths; xx xxxxxxx but His general Notions concerning the universe , the Harmony of things & the first cause of Being are xxx a much more impressive & wonderful character than any of his physical truths - |_He is the first Philsopher recorded 33 who asserted the existence of one supreme & intelligent mind, ruling & directing all things. - The sublime doctrine is attributed to him by Aristotle xxxx by Plato - Anaxogoras in consequence of his profession of this doctrine was sur named Nous or Nȣσ \" or the Mind & his ideas seem to have been of as high & as dignified full as xxx sublime & more distinct than those of the Platonic philosophers who came many ages after him . - Thus He is quoted by Cicero & Laertius as calling the supreme spirit infinite & self moving - not in included in matter but superior to it who when all was confusion produced order & who by His energy still preserves all things in Harmony. 34 -|_ The influence of the Anaxogoras in modifying the public character of this his disciple was great & beneficial . - He first taught the warriors Pericles & many of the other & great illustrious men, of Athens to despise the omens & the predictions of the soothsayers ; which had formerly directed all their exploits - When a Ram was produced at Athens with only one Horn - The Citizens were in the greatest distress supposing that it the prodigy portended great evils to the state - Anaxagoras disected the head & calmed the people: by shewing that it was the effect of an internal conformation of the scull. - Pericles himself by means of the knowledge He had acquired from the philosopher was enabled to 35 impure spirit into his sailors & soldiers terrified at an eclipse of the Sun - He made his cloak represent the Moon , & held it between himself & the Sun source of light - The explanation was received, & mark the battle was gained fleet clam sailed on prosperous & victorious.- - Anaxagoras ; in the high conviction of truth dared to attack upon all occasions the popular superstitions of Attica - He soon became obnoxious to the Augers & Priests who trembled for their decay of their power & influence wealth; He was persecuted by them & at last brought to trial .- - The principal accusation against him as would appear from the most accurate authorities \"was that He had asserted the Sun to be burning mass larger than pelopenesus \" This was regarded 36 as an impiety for the Athenians worshipped this luminary as a god. - Anaxagoras has had no worthy biographer; - & if Plato or Xenophon had described this incident of its his life, there is every reason to believe that it would have come down to modern times with as high an interest & as powerful an effect as the ever memorable end of Socrates .- - The first philosopher who had ever taught on the continent of Greece \"the man who had devoted forty years of his life to the service of his country; whose moral character was without a stain & who had given up his xxxxxx lands & his property that He might have nothing to withdraw his Attention from Science objects of 37 Science & utility - This man in his old age, in sickness & in poverty; was brought before a tribunal which after had endeavoured to instruct & enlighten - This man who had professed the most sublime & exalted ideas religious ideas ever entertained by a Heathen was brought before a tribunal which he had endeavoured to enlighten in his old age in sickness & in poverty before a tribunal counsel the members of which had been often instructed by his talents He was accused of blasphemy & condemned to die! - the reply of Anaxagoras to his Judges when he Heard his His conduct at the time of his trial sentence pronounced was worthy of his Character , worthy of the man who in the beginning of his career had said that the end of his existence was to enquire into nature & that his country was the Heavens . - He is said to have addressed 38 himself to the tribunal in this Man - You have passed sentence on me When he heard his sentence pronounced . -He simply said to the Judges. - Nature has condemned us all to die you was well as me! - It is asserted by some writers Historians that he was actually put to death; whilst others say that at the interception of Pericles - he was saved & banished the city for life .- he lived 20 years after his trial at Lampsacum ; & several of his sayings of his are recorded as delivered in that city. - For I shall mention two - one Of which supposing them accurate The last class report that 39 one equally denotes the unbroken firmness of his mind, & the other the Kindness & goodness of his heart. - Being asked whether He was sorry \"that He had lost the Athenians - He answered no, \"but I greive that they have lost me! - The Citizens of Lampsacum enquired if they could do any thing for him after his death.
