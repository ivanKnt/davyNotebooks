At this period, & before such an Assembly it will be wholly unnecessary it would be indecorous even to offer arguments in favour of the cultivation of any branch of Knowledge that can tend to improve Agriculture. - The connection of Chemistry with this most important of the Arts has long been felt & acknowledged by all enlightened Cultivators - Chemistry is justly regarded as laying the foundation; for the most refined scien= =tific principles belonging to the subject; & is in a high degree high degree capable of useful applications to the practical Methods of the Farmer. - Chemical Science has for its end the explanation of the intimate properties & constitution of bodies & their effects upon each other: & the means that it employs are experiments in which the different substances are made to exhibit their mutual agencies & the changes that they undergo. - The knowledge of the process of Vegetation process of Vegetation is of great importance in Agriculture; But this knowledge cannot be obtained unless the nature of the food of Plants be discovered, the influence of Soils influence of Soils upon their Roots; the effects of Air & Light, & dews upon their leaves be ascertained; & the constitution of the sap in its different",

The Magnesian limestone when thrown into Aqua= fortis Aqua= fortis Aqua= fortis or even into strong Vinegar dissolves very slowly indeed whilst the common dissolves with rapidity & makes an effervescence twenty times as great as great . - Again, A person who happened to have abundance of peat Land & who was acquainted with the use of the Berkshire peatash as a manure, & with the profits of the proprietors of the Berkshire peat district peat district might immediately suppose (if he had not studied the nature of the Substance ) that his peat would produce similar effects; & might begin to burn it & to apply it to his Land. to his Land.",
  "6": "where it would perhaps produce no advantages; for the ashes of peats differ exceedingly in their nature their nature & a great number contain substances of no efficacy as manure as manure : but the ashes of useful applica= = =tion are easily known by a chemical process for they are soluble nearly altogether in weak aqua= =fortis or in muriatic acid muriatic acid muriatic acid muriatic acid ; whereas the peat ashes that are defective in power are nearly insoluble. - Once more - The efficacy of Marle upon certain lands is well known; but there are some soils that it is not capable of improving capable of improving ; To know whether a soil would be improved by Marle in the common practice of Husbandry would require a laborious & an expensive experiment; but the chemical means of ascertaining the fact are very simple. - If the soil does not effervesce when vinegar is poured upon it We may be certain that Marle will be useful; but there is every reason to believe that it would have no effect if there was a copious effervescence & if as much as two thirds or even a half of the soil becomes dissolved in the Acid. - These circumstances are I trust sufficiently strong to shew, the intimate & useful connection",
  "7": "5 existing between Chemistry & Agriculture . And it is fortunate for the extension of useful discovery, that this connection is founded upon very simple principles which may be easily acquired easily acquired & which are almost independent of the more abstruse & more complicated parts of the Science. - The objects of the Chemistry of Agriculture are very simple & distinct & they may be easily classed & arranged. - In the Natural order of enquiry the first subject that presents itself is the Knowledge of the Nature & composition of Soils, - of the methods by which they may be distinguished & of the conditions essential to fertility - The discussion of the constitution of plants & of the natural Agents to which they are subjected properly follows - And on the comparison of the constituent principles of vegetable matter; with the constituent principles of Soils of water & of Air, the general theory of the growth of plants is necessarily founded, for all the organic matter that they contain must be derived either from the Land in which they grow or from the Atmos= =phere by which they are surrounded. -",
  "8": "- The effects of Manures effects of Manures whether they are such as supply immediate Nourishment to the vegetable organs or whether they are such as merely increase the activity of their functions merit in the highest degree, a full examination; & from the Knowledge of those effects in their relations to different soils the general chemical Theory of the improvement of Land, the last & most important part of the investigation is naturally derived. - I shall endeavour in this Course of Lectures to pursue these objects in the order in which they have been enumerated, & to bring forward all the new & useful information that I have been able to collect with regard to them - I shall particularly attend to the experimental part of the subject & to those operations which offer immediate practical applications; - & I shall take the liberty of prefacing the investigation by devoting the remainder of this lecture to a sketch of the History & progress of the Science; which will",
