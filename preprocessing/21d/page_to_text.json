I have felt that through life I have lost many thoughts that were worth preserving, not only for my own amusement, but for the amusement of others I believe I have often made observations and combinations that were new, at least I never met with them in books, and the present state of society and of knowledge is different from any that ever existed. Man has made a wonderful progress in physical knowledge: there are many profound thinkers in every thing belonging to the progress of political improve- -ment; but the governors of the world are children compared with their servants. The useful acts have made a much greater progress than at any former period; and the imaginations of men subdued by the sense of utility, no longer kindles into poetry, or freezes in profound metaphysics. A few scintillations shine in the gloom; but the public consider",

I left the baths of Lucca baths of Lucca baths of Lucca in with a Caratella and two horses, my two dogs and James , yesterday, and travelled to Florence where I slept. I thought the vile Fans the vile Fans might be changed with propriety to \"Nil vilise Fanc\" \"Nil vilise Fanc\" \"Nil vilise Fanc\" \"Nil vilise Fanc\" but I was piqued I was piqued perhaps my pique was illegitimate perhaps my pique was illegitimate I left Florence convinced, that some of the squabbles of the English with the Italian postilions are owing to their own ignorance and rashness I generally find them very quick and courteous and manageable. The Tariffe does not allow an extra horse; but I find there is a written law for it. I left Florence at 10. and got here at a quarter before 6. making the first post in 2 hours, the second in an hour and a half, the third in one hour and thirty",
  "7": "3 five minutes, the fourth in an hour and forty minutes and the fifth in an hour. I saw a man carrying some meat in the sun at the first post; it was so hot and there were so many flies upon it, that it stood a chance of not only being roasted, but eaten, before he got to the next village The hills of the Apennines are not beautiful till the third post; then they become green, and the quantity of oak and birch give great beauty to them, and they abound in meadows Near my old haunt Pietra mala Pietra mala Pietra mala Pietra mala the Appenine consists of a most singular rock a sort of Pudding stone Pudding stone Pudding stone containing much green stone and much and much & Sienite The meadows are exquisitely green. The temperature was only 62 at 8 in the evening and there was a strong wind, probably from the descent of air from the highest peaks of the mountains.

Bad inn, at the bad the bad Post, but not bad Bordeaux. The evening beautiful but as usual in towns, the thermometer did not fall as might have been expected: 75. in my bed room at a quarter past 9.

A beautiful sunset, and the Alps appearing in a great glory & beauty. Infamous cheating and money treatment in the Mantuan vicinity Mantuan vicinity Mantuan vicinity . The thermometer stands now (at Verona) (at Verona) (at Verona) at quarter past 11. night, at 77.5. I do not find the heat at all disagreeable: One perspires a little. The people at Roverbello complain dreadfully as they did in 1815 when I passed them of the events of the war; yet how fertile & glorious",

The corn is now all cut, and they may have a second crop, and wherever the Minsio runs, the country is emerald green, and the whole plain between Bologna and Verona is a garden, green from bright and high grass or maize or rice or rice or and vines, and yellow from stubble and a little standing corn.

The little stream issuing out of the Limestone at 55 o . was about 4 or 5 miles from Ala , towards Verona ; the temperature of the little river that runs by Roveredo , through a wild mountain pass was 56 o . The opening",

After we left the plain of Verona , the thermometer was generally above 86, and sometimes 90. in the shade: the effect of heat, when the whole surface is exposed to the sun is amazingly increased by radiation. On the banks of the Adige where the plain was considerable the vegetation was very rich and had all the brilliancy of that of Tuscany . This valley resembles somewhat that of the Arno the mountains of which have the same defects as to scenery. Found a comfortable inn and resolved to stay whilst my carriage was repairing. 27 th .

When we got on the hill above the lake, the lago di Garda the lago di Garda the lago di Garda the lago di Garda broke in upon us in great magnificence of a bright sapphire tint; and this tint contrasted with the red and dove colour of the Limestone cliffs of the mountain above it, on which white clouds were moving, gave great beauty and grandeur to the scene. The river which was one of my objects was turbid from the melting of the snow, but I saw a number of the trouts taken in it, from 40 to 3 pounds. They are evidently a trout having habits which lead them to feed in the lake, and then mount against",

The common trout, which is brought down from another river near Riva xxxx , and which is exactly our river trout ill fed, they call Carpione The river trout of the Lago and of the river which runs by Turbione are like those of the Colne , and have hardly any spots. The one I ate was 6 lbs and was pink, but I believe it had been injured in the nets, for it was not nearly so red as one I cut some years ago, which I believe was about twice as large: but it was a most excellent fish. I doubt not these fish might be taken with the hook, and I regret that I did not troll for them; but I went prepared for flyfishing, and had no minnow tackle for a fish of 10 pounds, and the water wa not clear enough for flyfishing. In the end of Sept r and in Oct r when the weather",

There is a tolerable inn at Riva , as I was told at Torbura verbure , and it must be a cool summer residence: the thermometer was from 72 o . to 76 o . in the middle of the day. It is now standing in the shade at Roverido at 81 1/2 at half past 5 p.m. and I am drinking water at 64 o which appears cold as ice. In The general geological aspect of the country in the neighbourhood of the Lago di Garda Lago di Garda Lago di Garda is like that of Illyria : the same great masses of Limestone and a similar stratification. The picturesque aspect is not unlike, but here the olive and the vine clothe the sides of the hills, and the chesnut and the oak rise to the tops of the mountains: and in Illyria , the beech and the oak occupy the hills, and the pine is",

Clouds began to gather upon the mountains, and rain effectually cooled the air, and prevented my newly repaired wheels from taking fire. Got to Bolsano , and slept at the Kaiser Crown Kaiser Crown , a tolerable inn: charges reasonable: A thunder storm kept me within doors. This is called an Italian city, but its population is German; not one person out of ten speaks Italian. 29th left Bolsano at seven; a beautiful morning: saw the clouds which remained, the remnants of the storm, rising up the snowy crags and cliffs and pine covered sides of the stern mountain.

Slept at a genuine Tyrolese Inn Tyrolese Inn Tyrolese Inn : civility, cleanliness, and all the comforts of the best English country inn; all the attendance by women. The postmaster, the innkeeper, and, how I know not in a country so little travelled through, every thing seemed to be in order. I suspect the country people make great use of these inns, for I saw numerous parties eating and drinking. 30 th Sept. Left ber: Wintel at 7. A reasonable bill Left ber: Wintel at 7. A reasonable bill of 4f. 24. of 4f. 24. Slept at Silliare after a very pleasant days journey: ascended through meadows to the spot where the waters part, and saw to the east, the source of the Drave , a beautiful limpid stream; and to the west, that of the Ey Eisach . Above Brunneken , the mountains are very grand and bold, and immense masses of snow covering them to their apparent bases",
  "18": "So that they looked like the Savoy Alps in Winter: the temperature of the air from 48 to 60; that of the Gisach where it is a small stream of 52. Below Brunneken , a magnificent chain of mountains is seen to the South, or the Italian side, and accompanied my view all the way to Sillian , which is on the banks of the Drave , a Stream here containing no Hucho , but trout and Grayling . These mountains appear of Granite , and excessively bold and precipitous, very like the needles in the valley of Chamouni and bearing almost the same relations to snow which lay in immense masses even at their juncture with the pine covered hills. July 1 st . A very fine day. In the morning the thermometer at half past 6, at 55 o : it rose towards 2 O.C., as high as 65. Fished in the Drave , and the Stream that joins it below Sillian , and caught 14 or 16 trout and Grayling : observed that the fish lay more in the still pools near the great",

The Hucho does not rise so high as this: the Grayling were larger than the trout, one near a pound. My host's son, who spoke Italian and a little French, did the honours of the house with infinite civility; and the people in general, seem an excellent race, not interested, courteous in manner and independent in character. July 2 d . It rained in the beginning of the night. Thermometer at my window this morning at 7, at 56; and it rose to 60 in the Sun. Left Sillian ; my bill amounted for the two days to 10 florins, add including a bottle of Wurtzburg wine, two florins. The valley of the Drave became warmer as we approached Lientz ; the river was turbid from the rain of last night, and in summer I was informed is rarely clear; either the heat",
  "20": "melts the snow which occasions a flood or the clouds bring rain. The town of Lientz is near the confluence of the Drave with the Isel ; and the Isel is much the largest river of the two. It was more transparent than the Drave , but had that blue milkiness which I have always found indicating a snowy origin. The little plain of Lientz surrounded by hills and mountains is extremely rich; and its temperature so much higher than that of the valley above, that Indian corn ripens, and some rye was already cut. The day was cloudy and showery, yet the thermometer stood at 64 o ; the temperature of the Isel 54. The prospect of bad weather induced me to give up the idea of going to Heligo blut Heligo blut Heligo blut and to the Glocknee ; and I was informed that this was not the season for the Hucho , that they are found or caught only in spring and autumn.

The inn did not tempt me, nor the offer of shewing me some hares to shoot, made by the Innkeeper and I went through the same kind of scenery to Greiffenburg , where I found a good inn and had a Hucho of about 2lbs and a half for dinner. It is like an ill fed trout, but has no spots; is much longer, and perfectly silvery. Its skin remarkably thick, its taste hardly different from that of the trout: it did not calver much, but probably it was 24 hours old. The Hucho that I eat at Gratz last year calvered like Salmon. I walked by the side of a beautiful stream that rose up through a glen covered with pines and fell over rocks, making some fine cascades. The valley here is well cultivated, extremely green and the haymaking going on.

  "73": "69 went a more disagreeable journey, than that of this day: not understanding the language, I could never satisfy the peasants, who were rude and coarse; and my forbode though it prevented me from waiting for horses did not secure me civility; and the peasants finding I could not speak Swedish, endeavoured to impose upon me. The weather likewise was stormy, with a bright sun, and a road which was covered with clouds of dust. The travelling is cheap enough: 16 shillings in the Country and 20 in town each horse, for 6 English miles. 48 shillings are equal to the 12 of the pound sterling; so that each horse costs 6 3/4 the Swedish mile, and 3 horses 1 s .8 d British, for 6 miles. From Undevelle next day, I pursued my road to Wenersburg , and found the Country improve There was a good deal of pine wood with crags of Granite , and a succession of small wooded hills, with small peaty streams, the outline of the country was generally made up of great",
  "74": "forests of pines. A Wenersburgh , the great lake Wener lake Wener lake Wener opened upon me with all the characters of the ocean; the banks are low, and the horizon is more than one half sky A little below Wenersburgh , I caught the first view of the Gotha the Gotha the Gotha , a very fine, clean, and greenish river, about the size of the Rhone at Lyons . It pours with great fury beneath a bridge thrown from rock to rock, over which we passed, and makes a fine rapid, or almost a fall: there is another rapid or fall of the same kind, just below. The banks are well wooded, but here too, there are no very fine distances a sort of extended fascades ridges fascades ridges of rock, capped by pines, extends to the left, and may have been an ancient bank of the river; from its distant appearance I should conjecture it to be trap; but I saw no fragments stones but I saw no fragments stones of this rock, and of this rock, and Granite is the rock of the country. I passed by some small lakes, over some wild heaths, and at last",
  "75": "71 came upon me the white foam of the cataract of Trolhetta rising like smoke amongst the Village. The river above is a fine wide, and tranquil expanse; at first it is tortured in its fall by saw mills; but at the second fall they disappear. Here there is nothing but the grand forms of nature, the bold grand cliffs, 200 or 300 feet high, covered with an almost infinite variety of kinds of wood, and capped by gigantic pines. The water is beautifully clear, and the rapids and falls for nearly half a mile present a variety of variety of picture -esque effect. Here a deep whirlpool beneath a fall of 20 or 30 feet in height, and where the river is pressed into the narrowest possible channel. There a succession of rapids, and all white foam, and force, and thunder. I fished and caught nothing but a little trout as long as my hand; though I was told of large trout of 6,7, or 8 pounds, inhabitants of the pool below the mill: yet the evening was favorable",
  "76": "and I tried my best flies and my best skill. The inn was very bad; the master and mistress the governess and the children, feasting and out playing cards. It was on a Sunday that I arrived: I could get nothing except what I brought and what my servant collected in the garden, and I was made sick even by this fare. I got up very early on Monday and examined the opposite side of the fall and went down to the locks, a fine work of art, when the navigation is carried on between Gottenburgh and the Wenersee. The locks are deep in the Gneis and Granite , altogether 120 feet in depth, and giving many fine falls and effects of water where they are to be filled from the clean and beautiful stream of the Gotha the Gotha the Gotha . The first natural fall seen from that opposite, is very fine. There is as island covered with wood in the middle which has much of the saw mills. The salmon never rise above the falls, and there are very few of them: I am convinced they can never abound",
  "77": "73 where there are many saw mills and much saw dust. I left the wretched inn for Gottenburg at 9 this day () I got on much better; at least I had no attempts at imposition on the part of the peasants. Throughout Norway and Sweden , the only birds I saw by the road side, except a few birds of prey were magpies and hooded crows: the magpies were in myriads and quite tame; so tame that I could have killed four or five together. The Swedes and Norwegians do not shoot them and animals soon find out their places of preservation. There was more beauty in the road this day, particularly by the banks of a small lake, where there was a great extent of wood and rock, and some islands: but this lake could only be called pretty . We passed through some large pine woods and opened open the Gotha the Gotha the Gotha , the banks of which down to Gottenburgh are green with a plain or flat surface of heath, interweaving between the river and the hills. The hills possess",
  "78": "some variety; and the Granite crags and trees, and great diversity of hilly outline is not devoid of picturesque effect. Gottenburgh is principally built of stone, has a few fine houses; and the Gotha the Gotha the Gotha and the harbour form important commercial characters. The inn, as usual, wretched; the cuisine insupportable cuisine insupportable . The bread was cockroach pudding cockroach pudding ; I swallowed one, and found another. The fatigue of travelling, and the misery of the inn, which was like an oven the windows having been kept closed, and the bad food at Trolhetta , all together, brought on a violent bilious attack with fever, which lasted four days. The third day, however, I went to the marshes, and saw M r Bloomfield M r Bloomfield M r Bloomfield shoot what appeared to me to be a Finland snipe . I went out myself the day after, and shot two or three wading birds, but found no double snipes . I shot a young snipe , and they say the double snipe double snipe double snipe sometimes breeds in this neighbourhood. I strongly doubt this",
  "79": "75 I found an old snipe , with a young one, the common snipe ; and I think it very likely they have been deceived in taking the young common snipe , which is larger and fatter than the old one, for a young double snipe double snipe double snipe : Yet the sportsman who spoke to me at Undevilla said he had seen some young double snipes , and he seemed to me to know the habits these birds well. He likewise described the breeding habits of the Woodcock and stated that they were not uncommon in the summer in the great woods of Sweden I went out the next day shooting to endeavour to ascertain more about the Finmark snipe ; but found no double snipes , and killed only a duck and a snipe , and could find no Finmark snipes . This day saw the Crown Prince of Sweden Crown Prince of Sweden Crown Prince of Sweden and his Princess, his Princess, his Princess, He received me amiably, and talked upon a great many subjects, and generally well; seemed to understand something of chemical science",
  "80": "and had general views upon all the sciences and enlightened ideas upon education and the policy of kings. He asked me to dine with him, I sat on the left of the Princess the Governor the Governor the Governor of the town sitting next her and a lady of the court next me. She has a beautiful upper countenance and fine blue eyes; but I should think her constitution feeble; the grand daughter of the poor Empress Josephine poor Empress Josephine poor Empress Josephine and very graceful and gracious in her manners. She talked to me about her Grandmother and Trolhatten. He entered into a long conversation with me after dinner \"de omnibus rebus, ut quibusdam aliis\" \"de omnibus rebus, ut quibusdam aliis\" \"de omnibus rebus, ut \"de omnibus rebus, ut quibusdam aliis\" quibusdam aliis\" , particularly Lancaster Schools and the Atomic system of Chemistry, and Prince Christian; of Denmark Prince Christian; of Denmark Prince Christian; of Denmark ; character, who he said was too fond of who he said was too fond of M r Nolan is a very hospitable and amiable merchant, lent me a carriage to come on to Helsingburgh , and I hired a man to take charge of me to Copenhagen",
  "81": "77 and to take back the carriage, my first day was to Falkenburg : the road was very pretty for the first two or three posts, and then became very dreary, like the wildest part of the low country in Aberdeen sh . Aberdeen sh . Aberdeen sh . There was very little pine wood, and barren heath and barren rocks formed a considerable part of the Country with some barley and rye, and the rye cut and potatoes here and there, and peat bogs At Falkenburg I went immediately to the river and fished, but raised nothing. Next morn g I went out and soon roused and hooked a Salmon, and fished with a good deal of spirit till dinner time. I killed four small salmon; two I hooked and one I killed, having seen them under the bridge, and in the evening I killed two more: altogether I hooked 9 or 10, and killed six; but the largest was not 6 pounds, and some of them were I think the Salmo Er but they gave good sport and took freely. I think there was a place further up where I should have had",
  "82": "better sport and which I saw only in going away. At La Holme La Holme La Holme , I saw a very fine river and was half inclined to stop; but the wretchedness of the inn prevented me. I saw a man fishing with a very large bundle of lob worms lob worms , with which they catch salmon; but they seem to know nothing of the fly. My guide at Falken -burg Falken -burg Falken -burg fished and caught one grilse with a worm. Neither at Falconburgh, nor at La Holme La Holme La Holme , are there any saw mills; and hence probably the salmon are found in plenty. They have precisely the character of second rate scotch rivers, and are not so hardly fished; but I doubt whether the Swedish fishery even in these rivers, can be reckoned superior to the Scotch. A gentleman had been there 3 weeks ago and fished without catching a salmon, and I believe I raised most of the salmon that day in the pools that I tried. From the appearance of the river at La",
  "83": "79 Holme , I am almost sure I should have killed salmon there; I saw a small grilse rise. The colour of these waters is peaty and the fall at La Holme La Holme La Holme is close to the road. From La Holme La Holme La Holme to Helsingburgh the country has nearly the same character as that I have already described. There seems nothing ever prepared in the Swedish inns for travellers; not even the delicacy of kippered salmon. At Engelholme, I had to wait an hour for horses, and likewise at the stage next La Holme La Holme La Holme , for there I overtook my Forbode though he had been sent 15 hours before I left Falkenburg . At Helsingburgh I got a tolerable dinner, and a bed in an enormous room, probably the assembly room. Here I had an interview with Berzelius , whom I found in good plight rather fatter than when I saw him 12 years ago. The next morning I hired a boat for Copenhagen , and left Elsineur and Hamlets garden left Elsineur and Hamlets garden left Elsineur and Hamlets garden on my left and in four hours landed",

The voyage from Helsingburgh was always along the green fields of Zealand green fields of Zealand green fields of Zealand , which here and there were crested with low wood, not unlike the banks of the Thames , with many Country houses, all of which had an English fashion. We passed by the 3 Crowns battery, celebrated for its effects on the fleet of our greatest naval Hero, and were as usual strictly examined at the Custom House which seemed to have rather for its object, the extortion of money, than any real desire to prevent Smuggling. I dined at the Table d'Hote, the mistress of the Inn was English, and had been probably housekeeper or ladies maid, and had the manners which belong to the shabby genteel. The dinner was very good and the wine excellent. I saw Professor Oersted , and",

Found that Prince Christian Prince Christian Prince Christian was in town the day after my arrival, and went to see him. He received me in the kindest manner without ceremony, and asked me to dine with him the next day. I accepted conditionally, provided the steam boat did not come, and fulfilled my engagement. I found him very amiable, in an agreeable country seat; living like an English country gentleman His villa was very like an English country house of the second or third class. The princess I found very much improved in health and person, and quite blooming, Oersted was of the party, and some courtiers The prince walked with me round his grounds and after dinner took me to the Kings Park Kings Park Kings Park , a deer park, like an English one very extensive, with some tolerable trees",

The public seemed to consider the princes' grounds as their own for there were numbers of persons walking there to whom he bowed, and had much that courtesy to perform. He asked me to dine with him again on Sunday. I obtained leave from Prince Christian Prince Christian Prince Christian to shoot at saltholme where it was said double as well as single, and Jack snipes breed. I went there on Saturday, and found an immense variety of wading birds on this low and flat island, an infinite variety of the Tringa kind, red legs green legs, the turnstone, the avocetta, the sandpiper, Tringa , Alpina in its summer plumage, and exactly like a snipe . I think I saw one double snipe double snipe double snipe , but was not sure, as there were no white feathers in the tail. I unluckily did not go to the South side of the island till late, and then my Senzacura",

Dined again with the prince the prince the prince on Sunday; a visit of ceremony; 30 people, and of course rather a bore. Went away as soon as possible. On Tuesday took the Kiel boat and had a pleasant sail to Kiel , through the islands; and a most wretched journey from Kiel to Hamburgh through sands and desarts. In going from Atona , Aug 8, to a country seat, my companion in the carriage as if casually said, that is the grave of Klopstock. the grave of Klopstock. the grave of Klopstock.

At first I thought it was an honour paid to the grave, and the memory of one of the greatest poets Germany has produced. It turned out to be a place, a Parish hall Parish hall , into which we entered, and saw W + R. not one whom had perhaps ever heard of Klopstock; such is glory and greatness; such the illustrious dead.

It had no white feathers in its tail, but some whitish ones, and had the speckled breast which I have always seen in snipes of this kind. The whitish feathers were spotted; whereas in the spring bird I have always seen some pure white feathers I have now no doubt, that the bird I saw at saltholme was one of this species; and I regret that I did not examine more the South part of this island, where they are said to breed. Hamburgh is a great commercial city with plenty of luxury and vice. The banks of the Elbe something like the shores of Zealand shores of Zealand shores of Zealand ; and indeed the description of green fields, marshy banks and applies to all I have seen in the uncultivated parts of Holstein and the Danish islands.

I did not describe the villages in Holstein , but at Keil the women appeared handsome and upon a large scale like their Maris like their Maris and G and G and the houses of the farmers had a grand display of culinary utensils and looked in the Country as if all roof.

This day Aug 9.

But in that kind of ground so favourable to the double snipe double snipe double snipe , a long grass with water covering it and green, we found two snipes , but as it poured they were very wild; One I saw; it had no white feathers in its tail, like the one I saw in September at Venice .

We were only an hour on our passage, and the distant view of Hamburgh and Altona , and the green pastures and wooded banks of the Elbe are not unpleasing as a view. It was full tide, and the water came very high, so that various wild flowers appeared with only their extreme branches above. At the first town in Hanover , Hamburgh , we were assaulted by beggars and little boys who mein lieber herr'd us for an hour with most persevering insolence.

Forests of great extent, with small hills, heaths of great magnitude, and cultivated but not enclosed land are the characters of Hanover The peasants were good looking, the women handsome; the inns appear better than any in the north, the post horses good, but they are slow, and the road though a work of Napoleon , heavy. 11. th Dined at the inn late, and had a very fair supper, and found the inn tolerable.

They display him, as a Poet, as a metaphysician, as a geologist, as a Chemist & as a Christian - & in each the Philosopher - the Philosopher in the original modest & humble meaning of the word. As such he began his career as such he terminated it & as such I trust it his name will descend to posterity - in youth illustrated by ambition of a name; in advanced life 271 they were written, - & the time & manner in which they were concluded; from the deep interest he expressed in them himself when I read them to him, during the height of his illness & when he supposed he had not many hours to live; - from his having en- trusted them to my care to publish bequeathed them to me in his will, & entrusted me with the publishing of them, - from these circumstance I am necessarily deeply in- terested in them - & also from their nature & tendency as to doctrine & the as the changes which take place on the surface of our globe from the action of the various causes to which material forms are exposed. Such is a very slight outline of this work, - which as his own preface states, was com- posed, during a period, of bodily indisposition, & as I have mentioned in a notice prefixed, was concluded at the moment of the invasion of the last attack of illness from which he never re- covered. - To me these Dialogues are particularly interesting; from the circumstances under which 273 in conversation with belief in Christianity.

In the fourth which is commenced at the falls of the Traun & concluded in the cavern of the Madelina , near Saltz burgh , the conversation is partly relative to that singular animal the Proteus anguinus, partly on the subject of respiration & animal heat & in part on the nature of the soul & on the destiny of man after death & 275 The scene of the Second Dialogue is the summit of Mount Vesuvius - & the subject of it a discussion on religion generally, the Christian in particular & more especially the Roman Catholic. - The third Dialogue is held at Paestum ; - a character is immodest & described called the Unknown - who takes the lead in the conversation, & from circumstances connected with the locality, proceeds to general views of the geological structure of the Earth & of the revolutions or changes which our planet has undergone 276 [horizontal rule] The last work of my Brother \"The consolations in Travel\" or \" Last days of a Philosopher\" consists of six Dialogues & is of a miscellaneous nature.
