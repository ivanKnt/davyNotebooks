  In it the statesman rules & lives And the low multitude controuls Fixed to the impulse that he gives As the firm earth around its poles. This magic light of life is thine And what if given in excess? It is excess of fire divine Which reason always can repress. Let not this gift which is from heaven Shine as a meteors transient light Or as the lightnings flashes given Amidst the gloom to pain our sight.

  151 By the imperial citys fallen walls Laying bare the bones of heroes & the monuments And Of generations of the ages past Or we might rest on that cloud covered hill Whose marble rocks are cloaked with brightest green. Where thousand flowers of unknown hues & names Scent the cool air, rarely by human breath inhaled But which the wild bee knows & ever haunts And whence descends the balmy influence Of those bright waters tepid from the fires Of ancient Appenine .
